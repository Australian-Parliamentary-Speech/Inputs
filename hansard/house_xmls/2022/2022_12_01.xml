                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  Well, what a year 2022 has been! Of course, 21 May was the key date in my life this year and a key date in changing the government of this country. When that occurs, you change the direction of the country. But it has also been a very difficult year in so many ways. We have continued to see the impact of climate change, with more frequent and more intense events. The town of Forbes in the member for Riverina's electorate has now suffered five floods in the last 12 months or so. It is just extraordinary. As Prime Minister, I have visited Rochester and Bendigo in Victoria, I have visited Parkes, Forbes, Lismore and other places in New South Wales and I have visited northern Tasmania, all looking at the impact of these devastating floods. I have been speaking with Premier Malinauskas in South Australia this week because the floodwaters are headed across the border into the Riverland, and this remains a very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hope, as we head into the Christmas break, that we see an alleviation of these conditions. But, once again, it has been a reminder that, at the worst of times, we see the best of the Australian character. Whether it be our emergency services personnel—SES, police, people who work for federal and state departments, the people in government services providing that on-ground support for people or the members of the Australian Defence Force who have been deployed very quickly into the areas in which they have been needed—or whether it just be members of the community who will drive hundreds of kilometres upon hearing that their fellow Australians are facing hard times to help clear up debris and build sandbags for people to build those temporary levees, we see extraordinary heroism from Australians during difficult times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when many families are able to sit around at Christmas and speak about what a great year they've had and enjoy each other's company, it is important to remember that, for many Australians who have lost loved ones or who are alone and doing it tough, it can be a difficult time at Christmas. I spend every Christmas morning with Reverend Bill Crews in Ashfield at the Exodus Foundation, where he feeds literally thousands of people. It's a reminder as well of how tough so many people are doing it in the community. Last year, of course, there were COVID restrictions, so people, by and large, were getting takeaway meals. What was extraordinary was that the queues for Christmas lunch began at 6 am in order to get a proper feed on Christmas Day and in order for children to get the gifts that are handed out at that wonderful loaves-and-fishes restaurant—it's actually the church—on Liverpool Road in Ashfield. This year I look forward to going for the first time as Prime Minister and sharing my morning with those wonderful people and with the quite remarkable Reverend Bill Crews. I pay tribute to all of those at this time of the year who help out the disadvantaged and the vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition and I, and the Leader of the Greens and others, attended the Kmart-Salvos wishing tree that's out in the foyer. There are so many charities and people who do great work at this time. I acknowledge as well that so many members of this parliament will be opening their doors, their arms and their hearts at this time to help people in their constituencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to wish all members of the parliament well during this season. I wish the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Nationals, the crossbenchers and my own colleagues all the best for the break. I said in the caucus on Tuesday—I encouraged people—that there will be no better time to have some time off than the summer break in the year of an election. So I hope people do take a bit of time to have a rest. An election period is one in which, as well as us, our families and those close to us feel a lot of pressure, and spending time with loved ones is always worthwhile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the people who are closest to me. My partner, Jodie Haydon, is someone who didn't have a political life and suddenly she was in camera shots with Brigitte Macron and engaging in a range of activities which, a few years ago, a coastie—as she proudly calls herself—from the Central Coast of New South Wales would not have anticipated. But she has, I think, represented Australia at appropriate times with dignity and honour, and I pay tribute to her and I thank her for sharing this journey with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my best mate, who happens to be my son, Nathan. He is a great young man. He will turn 22 next week. It goes quick. So I say to those in this chamber with little ones: cherish every moment because, before you look, they will be six foot four and informing you about the latest musical trends! It's been terrific as well to have him by my side, each and every day. Whether physically or not, he is by my side, and we talk every single day on the phone. He was a little bit jealous yesterday that Amy from Amyl and the Sniffers was in my office, and he will get a surprise next week when he sees the recording that she made for his birthday, next Thursday. It's okay, he's 22; he's not watching parliament—nor are any of his friends. There's a lot more to do in the inner west of Sydney than watch parliament, I assure you. To them both, I thank them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my colleagues: the Deputy Prime Minister—who is working, as he should be! At the risk of making an inappropriate disclosure, he's where I will be soon, in a room where you can't hear the parliament, doing his job as defence minister of this country. I cannot think of a more loyal, reliable deputy to have. That brings stability to our show that is so important, and I thank him for his support and for the work that he's doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Leader of the House—it's a good job being the Leader of the House. It actually is the only job in this building that I've asked for and thought about what I would want to do, when I was here. The parliament matters. This is not a debating society. It's how we make laws. It's how a democracy functions. The Leader of the House does a terrific job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the extraordinary frontbench team that I have, led by the economic team with the Treasurer and the finance minister, both Jim and Katy have done an extraordinary job, in difficult times, to craft the budget very quickly. We're already crafting a second budget, so there'll be two budgets within the first 12 months of the government that I lead. That presents significant challenges, but they have done an extraordinary job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no great secret that the person who introduced me, on that night of 21 May, is someone who I've been very close to for a long, long period of time. When we were in a Young Labor together, you would have got pretty good odds on Penny Wong being the Leader of the Government in the Senate and me being the leader of the government in the House of Representatives, given where we came from within the Labor Party. Penny Wong remains such an incredible friend, confidant and extraordinary foreign minister. I assure the House that in meetings I have with leaders at G20, APEC and summits I've held recently, at the PIF, Penny Wong is so warmly regarded and respected. That's a good thing for Australia—a very good thing for Australia—that that's the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the rest of the team in the Senate, led by Penny and her deputy, Don Farrell, they do an extraordinary job as well and I thank all of them. I thank the parliamentary staff as well, the clerks and all the people who keep things going, the people who clean our office, the Parliamentary Library, the people who work in the cafeteria, and the cleaners of my office—not the least, Maria and Anna—who see to it that my office is a lovely place to be every morning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge as well some special people—my security. I won't name them, for obvious reasons. It is the most challenging change in my life, which is full of positives. They have a difficult job having someone like me who likes spontaneity and says, 'In half an hour we're going to do this.' For Midnight Oil's final gig at the Hordern Pavilion, security said, 'We've got seats for you, but we know you're not going to stay in the seats, so we've organised special things to try to keep you secure.' They do an amazing job. They do advance work, including overseas, which presents significant challenges. I know that they provide protection for the Leader of the Opposition and a range of people as well. They are diligent and discrete and they keep us safe, which is part of their job. I thank them very much for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Glyn Davis, the head of my Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; all departmental heads; and, indeed, every single public servant in this great country. There has been a change of more than half of the heads of the Public Service. People were ready to move on. The people who have come into those organisations have undertaken their role diligently. Being a public servant is an honourable profession. I pay tribute to every one of them. They have all of my respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had drinks last night with the DPM, the Leader of the Opposition and others for the RAAF staff who look after us as well. It's great getting to know them personally. I think it was difficult for all of us last night to recognise them out of their uniforms. That was a way of thanking them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the ADF personnel who are serving us overseas. It is a great honour as Prime Minister to go to our bases overseas, spend time with them and just say thank you. These people put their own lives at risk in order to keep all of us safe and to represent Australia. I thank all of our serving defence personnel and I thank as well our veterans who have served this country. It's a very important role that they play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I thank you for the job that you are doing on behalf of the parliament to make sure that high standards are implemented. The way that you carry yourself in this place brings dignity and respect to this chamber. I wish you well, as I do all of the parliament here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to some of my personal staff. I thank my Chief of Staff, Tim Gartrell. Tim Gartrell worked for me with my campaign director in 1996 for the electorate of Grayndler, so you can say we've been together for a while. He worked in my electorate office when I was first elected. He went on to be the National Secretary of the Labor Party in 2007 and worked on the successful campaign that made Kevin Rudd the Prime Minister. He then went on to work in the private sector. He came back to be the campaign director for the successful 'yes' campaign for marriage equality that helped to change this nation for the better. Tim is a great friend. When I became Leader of the Labor Party, had that great honour, I contacted him and said, 'Right, you're coming back.' He made that commitment, and back indeed he has come. He plays such an important role in the office and leads an extraordinary team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank, in particular, Marika and Bell, in my office, who look after my diary and all the day-to-day things that they have to do. They do an extraordinary job. As does Liz Fitch, who leads my media team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fact that my office has more women in senior leadership roles than we've seen previously. That's a good thing, and that's something that we've changed, not just in the caucus, with 54 out of 103 members of the Labor caucus being women, but in the delegation to APEC, the G20 and ASEAN Summit—my chief foreign affairs adviser, my chief media adviser, my chief national security adviser, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the local ambassador in Indonesia as well as the ambassador in Thailand. At one stage it struck me that I was the only man in a briefing of nine senior people representing Australia's international interests. That is a big change on where we've been in the past. They are all, of course, absolutely there on merit. They are good, experienced people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of being Prime Minister means I'm not around the electorate as much as I used to be. I thank Tim Murray and my electorate office team for holding the fort during the weekly demonstrations that are held outside of my office. I say to the people who are engaged in that: all you are doing is stopping vulnerable people from getting social security support, getting immigration support and getting Medicare support. I'm not there most Thursdays when there's one or most Tuesdays when there's another. But that is something my office team have to deal with, and they perform remarkably well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know issues about numbers of staffing have been raised with me once or twice this year. I assure you, working in the electorate office of the Prime Minister, you'll know what busy means! They get calls from all over the country for legitimate issues, but sometimes they can be just robocampaigns into electorate offices, which don't really shift opinion. So they have to deal with those issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all members here, I conclude by wishing everyone a very joyous Christmas. May it be a time for those people of faith where they reflect on their faith and on the birth of Jesus Christ and what it means in their life. For other Australians who it means a chance to catch up with family, I hope it's as good and peaceful as it can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to coming back next year. It's been quite a year of significant achievement for the government. Whether people agree with our agenda or not, you cannot argue against the fact that we have been very serious about implementing the commitments we made to the electorate in our first six months—going through the list, as I have to ensure that the commitments we made are fulfilled—and it's objective that I have. There's more to do next year, and I look forward to returning here next year with a renewed sense of vigour and excitement. To those people on this side of the chamber, I say this: don't take it for granted. We won't. We will ensure as a government that there is no hubris, no taking it for granted and that we work methodically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the opposition, and to the crossbench as well, that I remain someone whose door is open. I attended the actual Prime Minister's office in 2019 on the day that parliament began. That was the last time I was in that office until I went in as Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition has been in their many, many times, as have crossbenchers and other members of parliament, and as has the leader of the National Party. My door is open. I see and take my responsibility to lead the country, and to engage with each and every member, in a serious way. It doesn't mean I'm not a Labor Prime Minister who was born Labor and will die Labor; that is who I am. It doesn't mean that I think we have all of the answers, because none of us do; we're much better off when we're working in a collaborative way. So we will stick to our values, but we're certainly up for collaboration and working in a better way so that politics functions better, because that is what the Australian people expect of us. Merry Christmas!</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:26</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words. Mr Speaker, we live in the greatest country in the world; there's no question about that. That's not just because the Socceroos are now through to the final 16, I might say! It was a great goal this morning. A lot of people will be going to work pretty tired today. The sporting achievements of the last year have been incredible for our country. We know it's summer when there's a cricket test in Perth. The second day will start a little bit later on today. The West Indies are obviously a good team, but I think the Australians have started very well, and that is always a good sign when we're coming into summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the best country in the world because of the finest among us, and they of course include the Australian Defence Force members. The Prime Minister was good enough to acknowledge in particular those who are working overseas, some in extreme conditions, and will be over this Christmas, in absentia and isolated from families. I acknowledge the men and women of the Australian Defence Force for the work they've done domestically as well over the course of the last 12 months: the deployments to flood ravaged areas, providing evacuations out of northern New South Wales and many other locations, including, most recently, in Shepparton and broader rural Victoria and New South Wales. Their work never stops. They work with us in a way that we see and they work for us in many parts of the world in circumstances that will never be acknowledged. The work of the Australian Defence Force, ASIO, ASIS, the Australian Federal Police—all of the agencies in keeping us safe and our equity safe internationally over Christmas—is something we should never take for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you very much to all of my colleagues. I have the most incredible team. I feel very fortunate to be in the position of Leader of the Liberal Party and to have a deputy like the member for Farrer, Sussan Ley, a person of great personal integrity and somebody who is widely respected on both sides of this chamber. I feel similarly about the Leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, who's a good friend, a fellow Queenslander and somebody I've been able to work with very closely. Coalition is integral to the success of our side of politics. John Howard instilled that in all of us at a very young age. I continue that fine tradition with a great deal of respect for the nuances and differences that we have from time to time, but it is a very strong partnership and long may that be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you very much to our team here: the shadow cabinet, the shadow ministry, the Manager of Opposition Business. I have some agreement on different issues with the Prime Minister, but my view is that Leader of the House and Manager of Opposition Business are two of the most dreadful jobs in this place—and I say that from experience! Being Leader of the House, particularly when there are very finely balanced numbers in this House, is not always a pleasurable task.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DUTTON:</span>
                  </a>  It distracts from your day job—there's no question about that! I have incredible colleagues in this chamber and in the other. I acknowledge the work of Senator Birmingham and all of our Senate team. Our whips do an incredible job. I said at our coalition Christmas party last night that the nuance and the ability to work across the aisle and deal with different debates in a respectful way, and to manage all of that and make it look as though nothing is wrong and everything is going swimmingly, is a pretty big undertaking by the whips. Our Chief Opposition Whip, Bert van Manen, is away crook at the moment but will be back soon. Our team here and in the Senate do an incredible job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I want to acknowledge the work you've given to the parliament since May and that of the Deputy Speaker, the member for Newcastle, and the Second Deputy Speaker, the member for Moore. I acknowledge also the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk, the clerk assistants, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services and all of the public servants and contractors who ensure that this parliament is well oiled and runs well. As the Prime Minister pointed out at Tony Abbott's portrait unveiling yesterday, it's the most visited building in the country, and we should be incredibly proud of it. We should be more proud of it than we actually are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This institution has survived many circumstances and many periods in our history when people would seek to undo our past or disregard the traditions that we have, but they're worth standing up for, worth fighting for. They're worth the sacrifice that colleagues on both sides of the parliament have made over the course of the last 12 months and the price that our families pay as well, when we're down here for 20 weeks of the year and on the road for most of the rest of the year. The sacrifice is worth it, because this country deserves a very bright future. As I say to kids when I go to schools in my electorate, 'There are good and bad people on both sides of politics, but the vast majority are good and have only the best interests of our country at heart.' If we're embarking on that destination, as parties we may on occasion take different paths to get there, but, ultimately, we have the same good intent for our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister, I want to say to you, Jodie and Nathan that I hope you get some rest and a good break this year. It's been a long and arduous period since May. It always is for an incoming government when the international engagement commences, and a lot of that had built up because during COVID we weren't able to travel overseas for a period of time, and our officials and diplomats were restricted in their own movements. Australia being back on the international stage has been a good thing. As you know, the coalition supported much of the activity and much of the achievement because it's important for the world, both our friends and our foes, to understand that there is a united position and that we will always fight for the best interests of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge those people who work behind the scenes here. The Prime Minister mentioned Maria and Anna. There's Lucia as well and the other cleaners who keep the building in impeccable condition. The maintenance people, the gardeners, the security staff—everybody has a great deal of pride in their work in this place, and I'm very pleased with the relationships we have with them. The respect that they show to us, and I think that we show to them, is something that makes this place tick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you very much to my personal staff, both here in Canberra and at Strathpine in my electorate: Alex Dalgleish, Tom Fleming, Nicole Chant and the whole team. Many of my staff have been with me through various portfolios. They're obviously unemployable elsewhere, otherwise why would they want to stick around with me! I really am very fortunate that they've been so loyal over a long period of time. Through babies and different life events, they've been able to stick with what is a very difficult job. Thanks also to Jacqui Cooper and to all of the electorate staff. As the Prime Minister pointed out, electoral staff cop a lot. As the staff of not only the Leader of the Opposition but the Minister for Defence and Minister for Home Affairs before that, my electorate staff have copped protests, people climbing up on the roof and people barging into the front of the office. The disgraceful disrespect that's demonstrated towards people who are just trying to help those who are genuinely in need of help in our electorate is something that's completely unacceptable. Peaceful protest, objection, debate and freedom of speech are integral to our freedom, but some of the conduct, particularly towards women in those electoral offices, is not acceptable, and it should be condemned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I too want to say thank you very much to the Australian Federal Police for the work they do, especially my close personal protection team. They also spend a lot of time away from their family, and, as the Prime Minister pointed out, every movement is scripted. If you want to go down to the servo on a Saturday morning and fill up the jerry can and come back, you need to give half an hour's notice for everything. I remember I once snuck off without telling the team, and I was dobbed in by the static team who were at home. They rang up the close personal protection team who then called me to see where I was going, like I'd absconded. I was literally just going down to the servo for 10 minutes. It's hard to describe the work that they do, but I thank them for the respect that they have for us and for our way of life, our privacy; it's an incredible intrusion. I'm blessed with three beautiful children and an amazingly supportive wife. They cop the death threats and all the rest of it as well, but they're stoic and put up with it because of the atmosphere that the AFP create both on the road and at home in protecting my family when I'm not there. So, thank you to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebecca turns 21 in March, and my sons are Harry and Tom. Harry has just finished year 12. He's been to schoolies on the Gold Coast, the most stressful part of my life over the course of the last couple of weeks. I had a message from Kirilly to say that he'd contracted a mild case of COVID and would have to come home early. I texted back, 'Gold.' He came back, he recovered and he wanted to return. We convinced him that wasn't a good idea, so two down, one to go next year for schoolies—we'll see how we go! But equally, we can't do it without our families. They're the most important thing in life, and my kids have obviously had their 100 hours getting their licences over the last couple of years. They've all done that with a police car in the rear-vision mirror. When you pull out from a stop sign or you're turning to go down the street, you've got to allow for two cars to turn, not just one. It's quite a skill, as the Prime Minister would appreciate. The kids have done it with great aplomb, without complaint, although they did complain about the police being at school with bum bags on. I said, 'Nobody will notice who they are.' They said, 'Dad, they're wearing bum bags at school and they're not that discreet!' They put up with a lot as well. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close by acknowledging those who are much less fortunate than us and who will do it tough this Christmas. We were at a function yesterday, as the Prime Minister pointed out, recognising the work of the Salvos. I've had a great deal of pleasure and honour to be the Red Shield Appeal chairman in my local area for almost 20 years. The work they do, the lives they save and the people they influence—they're quite remarkable. The Salvos are one of many organisations that will be hard at work while we're having a knees-up enjoying ourselves with family and friends at Christmas lunch and over the break. For the work they provide to those who are less fortunate, I thank them. We were at another function yesterday with Redkite. The Minister for Health and Aged Care and I were there. Redkite supports kids who have cancer. These kids are sick and some of them will be attending hospitals over Christmas as well. Spare them a thought. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do live in the best country in the world, and in part it's a great country because of the many people I've acknowledged today. I wish everybody a good break, a good rest. It has been a long year, and we deserve a break before we come back with great gusto in 2023. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I wish you a Merry Christmas. As someone who came into this parliament with you in 2016, I think there is some sense of pride about your ascension and the fact that someone from our cohort has come to lead this parliament. So congratulations, and I wish you and your family every festive greeting. To you and the parliament's staff and attendants, from our Comcar drivers right through to our gardeners and cleaners, who keep this place moving: thank you. It should never be taken for granted what they do for this parliament in making it run the way it should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the Prime Minister and his family, particularly Jodie and Nathan—you would not find a finer young man; he is genuinely a beautiful young man. To the Labor Party, I'd like to say thank you and congratulations, in all sincerity. I wish you and your families a festive season, one in which you have the time to reflect and are able to enjoy your families. To Peter, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Liberal Party: I wish you all the best during the festive season. Thank you for your respect for our coalition and your respect for the National Party and its values and principles, as we respect yours. I say to my party, the National Party: thank you for the honour that you've bestowed on me to be the leader of our great party, which is steeped in great tradition. Thank you to the crossbench, and we wish you festive season's greetings as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to particularly thank not just staff of the National Party but all staff, whether they be ministerial leaders or even electorate staff. They take on a great burden, and they take this on with a sense of dignity in the face, sometimes, of great adversity. We should never forget what they go through. Particularly when there is a change of government, there are many lost friends who aren't coming back—who didn't come back after the election. They are sometimes the human toll of democracy, and we should respect and honour those people who, unfortunately, didn't come back and who have had to find new occupations. It is important for us to acknowledge those men and women, fine young men and women, who come and are prepared to put their convictions behind a politician. That takes great courage, and great respect should be shown to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those in regional, rural and remote areas who are doing it pretty tough at the moment with floods: thank you for your courage in a time of adversity. This is a time where we see this great nation coming together, where this thing called servant leadership comes forward and where the local community put their arms around each other and makes sure that they bring the community through, day by day and step by step. We should be proud that we have a nation that can do that, whether that be through the ADF and those ADF personnel who are out there on the front line or whether it be the emergency service personnel, who are prepared, in many cases, to put their lives on the line for no pay and who volunteer their lives to save their fellow Australians. That's servant leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's something we as Australians should look up to, and we must understand that this great place has a responsibility to honour that in making sure that, while there is debate, and fierce debate sometimes, we respect what Australia should really be about and what our democracy should be about: empowering those great Australians who are prepared to do anything and put their lives on the line for their fellow Australians in their darkest hour. It is something that we are the custodians of, and we should take that deeply seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To people particularly in regional areas at the moment who are doing it pretty tough with floods: our thoughts are with you, and as a parliament we will be with you. When we get to this time of the year, it becomes even more difficult than other times, and, for those who have lost loved ones, tragically, this will be a hard period. So it's important that we honour and respect that and that we as a parliament know that the great privilege that we've been given to stand in this place, which very few have been given in our nation's history, includes a responsibility to continue to support them as they go through their journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great honour to be in this place. Thank you to my family, Amelia and the boys, who hopefully will get to see me a little bit—for a couple of weeks anyway. I thank them and the families of all those who reside here, as well as the staff, who sacrifice so much. We are the volunteers; they are the conscripts that put up with so much. In your darkest hour, if you don't have that support of your family, it takes a lot to get through. To have that support at home—until you've sat in these chairs and understood that it is difficult—to say thank you seems too little. To the families of all that reside in this place, this is a time to reflect and to honour you, to thank you and to understand that our great country is built on that principle of family. It's what keeps us together. It will drive this nation and it will keep us through the dark times and the good together as a nation. On behalf of the National Party family, to your families, I say: merry Christmas, and let's have a great 2023.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Lea</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">der of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  Mr Speaker, I seek to raise a matter of privilege. Earlier this year I raised with you the matter of the member for Cook's failure to inform the parliament of his appointment to a number of ministries without informing the parliament. On that occasion you did not find that a prima facie had made out in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> of the House. Since then a full inquiry has been undertaken by Justice Virginia Bell AC. That inquiry found, amongst other matters, that the actions and failures of the member for Cook fundamentally undermined the principles of responsible of government, were apt to undermine the public confidence in government and were corrosive of trust in government. These findings were endorsed by the House yesterday by way of censure resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the member for Cook made a statement to the House. During that statement the member welcomed and supported the recommendations of the Bell inquiry. The member for Cook also referenced the ministry list he tabled in parliament, making the statement that the ministry list tabled in parliament referenced, as it does, that the ministers may be sworn to administer additional departments. The member also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I now consider that these decisions, in hindsight, were unnecessary and that insufficient consideration was given to these decisions at the time, including nondisclosure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The relevant ministry lists did not note that the member had been appointed to additional portfolios.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I ask that you consider whether the report of the Bell inquiry, endorsed yesterday, and yesterday's statement from the member for Cook, raise any matters under standing order 52, including whether the purported reliance on the ministry list as sufficient disclosure to the House—which the member also appears to admit was a nondisclosure—constitutes a deliberate misleading of the House. I ask you to grant precedence for a motion to be moved referring this matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In moving this, I should give an update—which I suspect will not be my only update during the course of the day—as to how long we're likely to be in Canberra. I'm still advising, when speaking to a government members, that they should keep their diaries free, including Saturday, while we wait to see what happens in the Senate. There are two pieces of legislation in the Senate: one is the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 and the other is the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. We are not expecting the Territory rights bill to be subject to amendment, so whether the House waits for that or not probably doesn't matter—it would simply be a reporting back and it would make no difference as the territory assemblies won't be sitting before we return in any substantial way, anyway. How long we remain in Canberra is probably not contingent on the Territory rights bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The secure jobs better pay bill will certainly be subjected to amendments, and the Senate is continuing to debate that. If the Senate deals with that relatively quickly, then there is a chance that notwithstanding asking people to remain here until Saturday we will deal with issues well before then. As the Senate debate continues, I will continue to update members. But this resolution certainly gives the House that flexibility that, if we are still waiting on the Senate this afternoon following the MPI, then shortly after that I will ask for the House to suspend. But by then we should have a better knowledge as to where the Senate's up to. I commend the resolution to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most significantly, the bill expands the most serious offence under the Commonwealth's current work health and safety laws to include negligence as a fault element. The bar for conviction is currently set way too high. This change means that both reckless and grossly negligent employers who expose workers to serious risks will face the most serious consequences and penalties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will prevent a person required to pay a penalty under the law from recovering that penalty under a contract of insurance. The penalties in the act are there as a deterrent. Allowing companies to take out insurance against these penalties makes workplace injuries just another cost of doing business. Prohibiting such insurance forces businesses to take their work health and safety duties seriously. No longer will a statutory penalty just be another line on a balance sheet that an employer can recover from their insurer, while a family has lost a loved one in a workplace fatality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill clarifies that a health and safety representative is able to choose their own course of training and removes the requirement for the health and safety representative to make this decision 'in consultation with the person conducting a business or undertaking'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also introducing amendments to align service notice provisions to ensure clarity and consistency across the Work Health and Safety Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends the Safe Work Australia Act 2008 to clarify that information may be shared with Safe Work Australia when the information is relevant to their statutory data and evidence functions. Safe Work Australia publishes data that is central to work health and safety and workers' compensation policy development. Without a decent body of substantive data, governments are limited in their ability to develop good policy that solves real issues. In particular, Safe Work Australia maintains and publishes the traumatic injury fatalities database and the <span style="font-style:italic;">National </span><span style="font-style:italic;">dataset for compensation-based statistics</span>, without which we would have no clear view of the extent of work health and safety issues in Australia. This sensible amendment will ensure that Safe Work Australia can continue receiving information necessary to its research and data publication efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Safe Work Australia undertook extensive tripartite consultation, seeking feedback on implementing key recommendations of the Boland review on the model Work Health and Safety laws. This involved consultation across all jurisdictions and with union and employer representatives. In June 2022, the Model Work Health and Safety Bill was amended in line with this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would harmonise the Work Health and Safety Act with the recent changes to the model work health and safety laws. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills supports the implementation of the 2021-22 budget measure, Modernising and Improving the Private Health Insurance Prostheses List.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This first tranche of legislative changes is required to fully implement measures that will support, modernise and improve the private health insurance prostheses list, which will now be known as the prescribed list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first bill I'm introducing is the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill are important, as they will broadly support further reform activity aimed at keeping downward pressure on private health insurance premiums by reducing the costs associated with medical devices and human tissue products. This will be achieved by modernising administrative processes and cost-recovery arrangements, which will improve the affordability and attractiveness of private health insurance for consumers. This is good news for privately insured Australians, who paid around $26 billion dollars in premiums in the year ending 30 June 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian health system operates under a mixed model of private and public health care, with private hospitals and private health insurers playing critical roles. Australian consumers with private health insurance may choose to receive treatment as private patients in either private or public hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For privately insured patients with eligible health cover, private health insurers are required to pay set benefits for certain kinds of devices and products. Expenditure on medical devices and human tissue products accounts for around 14 per cent of the private health insurance benefits paid annually. It is therefore important that Australians continue to receive value for money for their private health insurance, including when it comes to treatment with medical devices and human tissue products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these measures, there would be no additional out-of-pocket costs for consumers on an ongoing basis. The measures will also benefit consumers by supporting access to innovative medical devices and technology on the prescribed list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises the important role medical devices and human tissue products play in the overall health of Australian patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide greater clarity about the kinds of products intended to be accessed through this system. The measures will ensure not only certainty about the benefits that are reimbursed but that they are cost effective. This will provide increased transparency for the medical technology industry, hospitals, clinicians, private health insurers and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also renames the relevant legislative instrument that may specify the benefits for these devices and products. The new name will be the Private Health Insurance (Medical Devices and Human Tissue Products) Rules. This new name reflects the clarified scope of medical devices and human tissue products for which private health insurers must pay set benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also updates the cost-recovery arrangements by introducing a fee-for-service based approach, where the fees paid by medical device sponsors to list their products reflect the effort required to assess the application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These arrangements will support a predictable environment in which sponsors can have the confidence to continue to provide medical devices and human tissue products to Australians while also maintaining a stable, sustainable and innovative industry sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill does not affect clinician or patient choice in the private health system, and it does not affect access to medical devices or human tissue products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the bill supports the government's priorities of ensuring that people can access affordable treatments and that Australians with private health insurance get value for money.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to introduce the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to implement a number of measures which support the delivery of the highest-quality health care for the Australian public by ensuring the continued access to critical prescription medicines and supporting the safe use of therapeutic goods by strengthening therapeutic goods post-market monitoring and compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the bill supports the implementation of a scheme for the mandatory reporting by hospitals of adverse events associated with medical devices. Following the 2017 Senate inquiry into the number of women in Australia who have had transvaginal mesh implants and related matters, the inquiry made a number of recommendations designed to improve patient safety and better ensure the early detection of safety signals. Recommendation 1 from the inquiry noted the vital role of adverse event reporting in post-market surveillance. The bill introduces the legislative framework for a scheme involving the mandatory reporting of adverse events associated with medical devices by hospitals, reflecting that for many patients the hospital setting is where adverse events involving medical devices occur or are recognised. This measure supports the improved monitoring of safety concerns associated with medical devices through access to information held by hospitals that identifies serious adverse events, and facilitates the earlier detection of safety signals that may raise concerns about particular devices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill encourages innovation and investment in biologicals in Australia by introducing a new dedicated pathway for marketing approval of biologicals that are for export only. This measure is designed to provide incentives for investment in the export of biologicals from Australia, and encourages development of this industry, by reducing the regulatory burden and supporting sponsors of such products to obtain marketing approval. It would also ensure consistency across the regulatory schemes for medicines, medical devices, and biologicals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill addresses and alleviates the effects of medicine shortages, by amending the act to allow the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care to approve the importation or supply of an unapproved medicine that could act as a substitute for medicine that was previously approved in Australia. This measure provides an important additional mechanism to help deal with critical medicine shortages, by allowing the importation or supply of an available overseas medicine that could act as a substitute for a medicine that was approved in Australia, but has since been cancelled or suspended. In some cases, this may be the only option to deal with a medicine shortage. Before exercising such a power, the secretary would consider the suitability of granting such an approval, including whether it is in the interest of public health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill supports the safe use of therapeutic goods by strengthening monitoring and compliance activities through a number of measures. The bill removes review rights for decisions to require the production of information or documents which are critical in identifying and investigating potential contraventions of the act, detecting safety concerns, and potentially preventing adverse events, associated with therapeutic goods. The measure is designed to prevent avenues of review for such decisions being misused to impede and delay timely regulatory action to protect Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a general information-gathering power to enable the secretary to request information from any person who may hold information relevant to a potential contravention of the act. This may include, for example, a financial institution which may hold records of transactions, contractors involved in the supply chain or persons who are involved with the supply of illegal therapeutic goods. This general information-gathering power is designed to support the comprehensive and timely investigation of possible contraventions of the act and enhance the protection of Australian consumers from poor quality, and potentially unsafe, therapeutic goods through access to relevant documentation about potential contraventions of the act. The bill also extends the time frame for holding seized goods to 120 days, to provide a more appropriate time frame for seized goods to be laboratory tested, analytically assessed and carefully examined, and for regulatory or compliance action to be instituted where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes a couple of changes to the regulation of advertising of therapeutic goods. First, the bill provides that the advertising requirements do not apply to an updated list of persons, including certain health professionals (such as oral health therapists), persons purchasing therapeutic goods on behalf of registered charities or governments, or to purchasing officers or practice managers of healthcare practices. Second, the bill provides a mechanism for an approval of a restricted representation to be withdrawn where additional information about the efficacy of therapeutic goods becomes available. This ensures that therapeutic goods advertising only contains correct and accurate information, taking into account all relevant information known about the goods, and therefore reducing the risk of unsafe use by consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains a measure to support compliance by enabling the secretary, on the secretary's own initiative, to extend the due date for payment of an infringement notice, supporting the early resolution of a contravention of the act where a person intends to pay the infringement notice, but does not do so before the expiry date. In so doing, this measure will support the early resolution of contraventions of the act by infringement notice rather than criminal or civil court proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes a number of other amendments to improve the clarity and consistency of regulatory requirements, codify current practices, and make other more minor changes to remove redundant provisions and correct typographical errors. In particular, this includes amendments to:</span>

This legislation goes right to the heart of many people in this nation that are dealing with issues that are ongoing; they don't end. The legislation being brought forward by the government today is crucially important so that the tragedy that happened with these mesh implants will never happen again—ever, ever again. Thank you for the opportunity to make that contribution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 provides for greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration. It will ensure the Australian people are able to access information related to the composition of the Federal Executive Council, those appointed to administer certain departments of state, and the high offices that ministers of state hold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are a vital part of the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Inquiry into the Appointment of the Former Prime Minister to Administer Multiple Departments</span>, led by former High Court Justice, the Hon. Virginia Bell, AC. The report was provided to the government on 25 November 2022 and has been published on the inquiry's website. This bill demonstrates the government's readiness to act promptly to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government, and to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the genesis of the Bell inquiry stemmed from media reports in August this year that the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, had been appointed to administer multiple portfolios during 2020 and 2021—namely, the Departments of Health; Finance; Industry, Science, Energy and Resources; Treasury; and Home Affairs—in addition to his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government referred these matters to the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC. Dr Donaghue advised, 'The principles of responsible government are fundamentally undermined by the actions of the former government.' Following the Solicitor-General's advice, it was also clear that an appropriate inquiry was needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bell inquiry examined how this happened, why it happened and who knew about it. It is essential that we have transparency in our government processes because our system of parliamentary democracy relies upon conventions and the Westminster traditions of checks and balances. As was made very clear by the Solicitor-General, 'It is impossible for the parliament to hold ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which ministers are responsible for which departments.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government commends Ms Bell for her service in leading this inquiry. She conducted her review with professionalism and dedication. Her report is comprehensive and even-handed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has accepted all of Ms Bell's recommendations, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been directed to implement them. Introduction of this bill is part of that task. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 will require the official secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument on the Federal Register of Legislation as soon as reasonably practicable in the following circumstances: when the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council; appointed an officer to administer a department of state; or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It will also require notification on the revocation of any of these positions to be published.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The notifiable instrument will include the name of the person; the department of state, where appropriate; and the date on which they were sworn, appointed or directed. In the case of revocations, the notifiable instrument is to include the name of the person, the name of the former office and the date that such membership, appointment or direction was revoked. The notifiable instrument may also comprise a copy of an instrument issued by the Governor-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill shows the government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics—the centrepiece of which is the establishment of the powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in the bill will restore integrity and transparency to the process of appointing elected officials to high office, and ensure we have a system of government where there are checks and balances. Never again will one person be able to garner powers without adequate, and warranted, accountability to the Australian people and the Australian parliament.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JOSH WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report into two proposed treaty actions: the Agreement between Australia and Japan Concerning the Facilitation of Reciprocal Access and Cooperation between the Australian Defence Force and the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement has been negotiated in the context of a more contested strategic environment and represents part of the growing security cooperation and strategic alignment between Australia and Japan. Ultimately, this agreement is set to strengthen Australia's military capabilities and our ability to support an open, secure and resilient Indo-Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a reciprocal status of forces agreement, the agreement would establish a legal framework for defence cooperation to occur, dealing with a range of issues including movement of forces and equipment, the use of facilities and services, command and control, claims, costs, and criminal jurisdiction. As such, the agreement would contribute to more efficient and less administratively cumbersome defence cooperation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's attention during the inquiry was significantly focused on the criminal jurisdiction provisions in the agreement and accompanying documents. This was because Japan retains the death penalty for certain offences. The committee examined the status of the death penalty in Japan; the compliance of the agreement with Australia's international obligations and our separate national strategy for the abolition of the death penalty; and the extent of protection offered by the agreement against the potential application of the death penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted evidence from participants to the inquiry who expressed concern about the use of the death penalty in Japan; recognising that under this agreement there isn't absolute protection from the death penalty for Australian servicepeople or relevant civilian personnel who might be based in Japan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, the committee was informed that the duration of negotiations to reach this agreement, over the course of some seven years, was significantly due to consideration of the death penalty issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubt that in regard to the proposed agreement and associated documents considerable effort has been made to deal with that issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding its inquiry, the committee found that while a blanket immunity was not achieved, very significant steps—negotiated over a substantial period of time—have been taken to protect Australian personnel from the possibility of being subject to the death penalty in Japan, while also maintaining Australia's international obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes that in 2018 Australia adopted a distinctive whole-of-government Strategy for Abolition of the Death Penalty; that Australia seeks to be a global leader in this cause; and that the Australian government opposes the death penalty in all circumstances for all people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When considered in the context of Australia's increasingly complex Indo-Pacific strategic environment, the committee was of the view that on balance the agreement was in the national interest and accordingly recommended binding treaty action be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving now to the committee's inquiry into the Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education, a treaty in whose negotiation Australia played a key role, I want to indicate that the Committee heard—took evidence—that the global convention would provide a framework for the recognition of Australian qualifications internationally, and the recognition of overseas qualifications in Australia. In so doing, it would potentially have significant benefits for Australia's education sector. And, of course, that's one of two service sectors that fall within the top five export earners for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, the global convention establishes universal principles and processes for the recognition of studies and qualifications, and the right of individuals to have their foreign qualifications assessed in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadly, the global convention would require the recognition by parties, for the purposes of study and employment, of qualifications gained overseas unless it can be shown that an overseas qualification is substantially different to the corresponding qualification in that party's nation-state. The onus is placed on competent recognition authorities to establish the grounds for substantial difference if that is asserted. The process must be transparent and occur in a timely manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, Australian decision-makers would retain full autonomy with regard to which overseas qualifications would be recognised, and how that would occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global convention has the potential to improve Australia's competitiveness globally for students and skilled migrants; to demonstrate Australia's leadership and promotion of best practice; and to contribute to positive international relationship-building; and remove trade barriers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was of the view that ratifying the global convention was in the national interest and recommended accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  The opposition rises to support the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 5) Bill 2022 and to ensure it has an expeditious route through the House. For those with great interest in tax matters like me and the minister opposite, the income tax law allows tax deductions for taxpayers who make a donation of $2 or more to a registered deductible gift recipient. To be eligible to be a deductible gift recipient, an organisation needs to fall within one of the general divisions set out in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, or be listed by name in the division. It can be done by the charities commission or indeed be set out by law in what is generally a tax law amendment bill. It's a common practice that governments of all persuasions have done from time to time. Many of the organisations that are listed here for DGR status in this bill were put into the budget by the previous government, so it is only appropriate that this method is done. The coalition supports what the minister is doing here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Keep in mind that the deductible gift recipient list was a previous schedule to Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 4) Bill 2022, but TLAB4 is taking its time being debated in the normal course of affairs and won't be done until next year. The government has separated this out. I simply say to the government: you could have done this wrong. The government could have done this anytime over the last six months. It could have simply put together a quick TLAB and put it through. Putting through TLAB4 and suddenly panicking because it won't get through shows a Treasury team that is not on top of its game. I say to the Treasury team: these things are important. They're retrospective, so none of these organisations miss out per se—the time taken through the parliament won't adversely impact them from the date at which DGR starts—but many Australian taxpayers may not provide donations until the DGR status come through, unsure as to whether it will pass parliament, and that may have a deleterious effect or impact upon donations. All of this could have been avoided if the government had prioritised this earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax law amendment bills are very, very simple. I think I did 31 bills in nine months as an assistant Treasurer. We know how to move bills through a House. But the government is focused on other matters—matters they did not take to elections. They're focused on watering down transparency for superannuation, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I say to the government: these things matter. There's no question the opposition will support you and be responsible because we understand they matter, but it's important that the government prioritise this type of legislative work, not legislation that they didn't take to an election or legislation that is not urgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate those organisations that will be receiving their DGR status, many of them committed to by the coalition—the Melbourne Business School, the Leaders Institute of South Australia, St Patrick's Cathedral Melbourne Restoration Fund, the Jewish Education Foundation, the Australian Education Research Organisation, Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition, the Sydney Chevra Kadisha—which is a charity that attends to Jewish burials to ensure they're undertaken in accordance with the faith precepts—and the Australian Women Donors Network. The Mt Eliza Graduate School of Business and Government has ceased its operation and activities, therefore this is a move to ensure that they no longer require it to be provided. I wish all those organisations the very best as they seek to serve Australians, and we look forward to supporting the minister and his deliberation.</span>

I commend the words of the member for Fadden around the predicament that the government have found themselves in, having to proceed down this path with this separate bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the entities in this bill that receives DGR status is the Leaders Institute of South Australia, and I want to put some words of support for them on the record here in this debate. They do excellent work. The Governor of South Australia, Frances Adamson, is the patron of their organisation and, though that and the Governor's Leadership Foundation, they do excellent work in identifying, supporting and providing a program for emerging leaders in South Australia. We definitely commend their work, and this DGR status puts them in a position where they get deductible gift status, which will help them with more support et cetera and those that want to support them will get a fair and reasonable deduction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's noteworthy, I think, that the Indigenous recognition group are being registered for DGR status. It reminds us that this Indigenous voice referendum is going to be a significant part of 2023. It's one thing that I think is really important in our democracy. I very much support them getting this status, and inevitably there will be other organisations, both for and against the referendum question, that will probably emerge over the coming months. It's important that we treat everyone fairly through the process of wanting to participate in the debates on that referendum. It'll be on the hands of the government as to when the referendum is held. I noted at the introduction of another bill earlier regarding the referendum and in that the government have confirmed there won't be any taxpayer support for the campaigns for and against, as was the case for the referendum in 1999, when there was taxpayer funding for both sides of the argument. It will be during the debate on that bill that we'll get into discussing funding. But I'm thinking fairly deeply about that situation, because I believe we want everyone to have confidence that it's a fair playing field for the referendum next year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxpayer funding in some form usually provides the ability to demonstrate that there's no attempt to give one side of a contest a particular advantage. Those progressing the yes campaign, like the group mentioned in this bill, have been in existence for some time and are no doubt well resourced. Good luck to them for that, but that's something we may have to confront, whether or not it is going to damage the perception of the legitimacy of the process of the campaign if a very well organised and well funded side of the debate exists before the debate begins. We're apparently going down the path of not providing any taxpayer support for the two sides of the argument, and I'm reflecting on how that might give rise to certain perceptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of DGR, I want to acknowledge the Andy Thomas Space Foundation. I was really pleased to work closely with former treasurer Josh Frydenberg on getting the foundation their DGR status a year or two ago. I congratulate Nicola Sasanelli, who was in building this week. She's the CEO of the Andy Thomas Space Foundation. Andy Thomas is a very famous former constituent of mine in the seat of Sturt. He went to school in my electorate and is the first Australian NASA astronaut. To do that, you have to be a US citizen, so Andy is now a US citizen. The foundation is doing great work, particularly in getting young people excited about space and STEM. We all understand that getting our next generation to want to pursue careers in STEM is a challenge. The opportunities are enormous, and raising awareness is something that the foundation does really well. Andy has said to me that the two things that get kids excited about STEM are space and dinosaurs. We have Jurassic Park doing the heavy lifting on the dinosaur front, and even the Lego people are doing a lot of Jurassic Park stuff. Young kids love dinosaurs and they also love space and everything to do with space. The Andy Thomas Space Foundation are doing excellent work working with the Space Discovery Centre in South Australia, providing an educational framework for kids. I really do commend them, and I give them a shout-out. With those words, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  In reply to the Governor-General's speech it's so important to lay out some of the issues. Yesterday I spoke about the environment, global warming and the economic challenges that we face and that will need to be addressed in this parliamentary term, but it's also important to reflect on the last two years and the health challenge around COVID. We must make sure that we keep our communities healthy and connected. I am very focused on looking at responsible and proportionate responses to the challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've learnt so much over the last 40 years. Today is the international day for the fight against HIV/AIDS. We learnt so much about how to fight infectious diseases from that, for example. That really assisted and informed our approach to dealing with COVID. Now we have learnings from COVID and how the world responded that can go back into other infectious diseases treatment, prevention and in particular education and testing. It is really important that we listen to epidemiologists and businesses, that we act on the advice of health experts and that we increase funding and support for essential frontline workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a very important debate in this place yesterday around eating disorders and the sharp increase we've seen in relation to that issue since COVID. We know that there is a lack of treatment facilities. It's an incredibly distressing ailment. It interrelates with mental health issues and it disproportionately impacts our young people, particularly women. It's really important to take a holistic approach to health—the whole-body health—and not separate out mental health and physical health. Too often we focus on the physical ailments, where it's immediately evident—broken bones or blood, which are much more visible—but mental health needs to be approached in a holistic way. That's why improving mental health services nationally and in Warringah, especially youth mental health services, is very much a focus of mine—to make sure we take care of our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to modernise and increase the channels to access health care. We know that telehealth was incredibly successful during COVID, and we need to continue going down that path of digitising access to health while being mindful, of course, of those of an older generation for which that might be challenging. But, obviously, we need to make sure delivery of services is in tune with the times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think there is a community around Australia that isn't focused on aged care, the delivery of those services and the difficulty in making sure that the vulnerable in our community are properly cared for. We need to ensure that implementation of all the recommendations of the aged-care royal commission occurs without delay. We know there remains a significant waitlist when it comes to aged-care plans, and we need to make sure that support is accelerated. I so strongly support flexible funding options for home care and increasing accountability and resources in aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken with the minister about the NDIS and improving access to participants and providers. So many in my community approach my office for assistance. It shouldn't be that way. You shouldn't need that individualised attention. The system should work. But I reiterate to the people in Warringah that my office is absolutely there to help you navigate this process, and I look forward to hosting a forum with the minister to address issues and challenges that participants have, because it is such an important program. The NDIS is such an important aspect of making sure that all Australians have the opportunity to be supported and participate meaningfully in society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll continue to stand up for integrity and accountability to restore trust in Australian politics. We absolutely have a duty in this place to ensure scrutiny and accountability at every level of government, in particular at federal level. It was a big day in this place yesterday with the censure motion moved in relation to the former Prime Minister. I must say I was disappointed by the words that were said by him in this place, because there still seems to be no willingness to acknowledge the issue of the secrecy. I have no issue with responsibilities and appointments. The issue is the secrecy. The accountability and the conventions of this place are incredibly important to uphold, and it is pulling back that curtain on the operations of this place that is so important for the Australian people to have trust in what happens here—trust that things are done in their best interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a big day yesterday, and I was very pleased to see the National Anti-Corruption Commission come into law. It's good legislation, but I still have to say it's not great legislation. I have my concerns that it may not provide the public scrutiny and accountability that I think so many Australians want, because of the threshold test that says that investigations and hearings can only be held in public in exceptional circumstances and if it is in the public interest, at the discretion of the commissioner. My legal experience says, and I suspect, that that will be a very high bar to meet, and the public simply won't be aware of much in the way of investigations. They won't be aware of what investigations are occurring, when they're occurring, what evidence is being heard and also what the outcomes of those investigations are by way of reports, because there is no requirement for reports to be published or presented to the parliament. So I do have concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a little bit with mixed feelings that I welcomed the passing of the legislation. Getting a National Anti-Corruption Commission is long overdue, and I certainly fought hard with the member for Indi and so many others in this place in the last parliament to get that to happen. But I think it puts us on the start line of the fight for integrity and against corruption. We need to be vigilant and to continue pushing for the other things, because, in isolation, it won't be enough. We need whistleblower protections and we need much better scrutiny around our media ownership and diversity. We need truth in political advertising and, in particular, around the referendum that is coming next year. We need to stop misinformation and disinformation in our public debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australians can handle the facts and the truth. But we know how pervasive misinformation and disinformation are, and they really erode trust in outcomes and trust in democracy. We saw in the US, with the 6 January insurrection, the sway that misinformation and disinformation can have in relation to the public perception of facts and reality, and it's incredibly dangerous. Democracy is fragile, and it is only as strong as how well we defend its pillars. Misinformation is a massive threat to that. One of the first things autocratic governments do is to control media and access to information. That's why it is so important that we remain vigilant on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased to be on the task force in relation to the implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">et </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">standard</span> report by Kate Jenkins that was done after the very serious allegations and events that arose in the last parliament. I'm pleased to see the work in relation to the code of conduct for parliamentarians that is coming, and I look forward to further developments and the implementation of those recommendations. It's so important that Australians respect and look to this place as a gold standard of a workplace and for it not to be a workplace that is miles behind other places in Australia. I must say, as a former barrister, I was quite shocked to come into this place in the last parliament and discover that there was no code of conduct, there were no standards and there was very little expectation other than just the assumption that the public will hold you to account every three years at election time. But, in circumstances where misinformation is rife, I don't think that's good enough. I think there should be a duty to this place—a standard of conduct expected of all members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure we're focusing on merit based policies and we have fiscal discipline in that process. I definitely want to encourage the government to focus on recommendations and the evidence around reducing the influence of vested interests and big money in politics and in the Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to encourage the government to look at long-term approaches to policies, because we know we have big challenges ahead. This is a very important decade, for Australia and for the world, on very big issues. We are facing headwinds. There are challenges. But no generation has ever been without challenges. There are always going to be those aspects. It does take courage, leadership and bravery to focus beyond what is immediately rewarding in a political sense—those short-term policies that we know are a quick sugar hit, are quick and easy and will be pleasing to electorates and will win votes. We must actually tackle the big issues—the things that go beyond a three-year election cycle. We must tackle those big challenges such as global warming and climate change and really set up our economy for the future. We need to support our young people in the challenges and the anxieties they have towards the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do think there needs to be a discussion around, for example, the rapid revolving door of election cycles. We need to look, as our state governments have, to four-year fixed terms when it comes to the federal parliament, because I think this focus on constant turnaround towards elections means that we simply never address the long-term issues that require focus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I just mentioned, there's also a concern around our diversity of media. I strongly support the member for Goldstein's push—obviously, her experience is so telling in this space—for a royal commission or an inquiry into media diversity in Australia. We know misinformation and disinformation play a huge part, and we need to ensure that access to information remains diverse. We have, I think, an unhealthy media ownership concentration in Australia. Media have taken, more and more, a partisan position in relation to so many issues. That is dangerous. The role of the fourth estate is to sit outside of that. Journalism is protected by defamation laws because it's in the public interest to have information, but it shouldn't be partisan. The point of the fourth estate is, in fact, to provide that information and to protect democratic principles. I do support the member for Goldstein's push in that respect and hope the government is really contemplating that. These are hard discussions to have, obviously, but I think they're incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from the 2022 election, I can't fail to talk about diversity and inclusion. We need to make sure that we are a more caring and inclusive society. We've talked a lot in this place about improving inclusivity when it comes to workforce participation, pay equity and, in particular, gender. I moved a motion in August in relation to increasing paid parental leave to at least 26 weeks, shared between both parents, because the economic analysis shows the cost is reasonable and there's a significant return on investment. So it was very welcome to see the government shift its position and bring forward a commitment to legislating around 26 weeks of shared paid parental leave, making it accessible equitably to men and women or both parents, to improving access to affordable child care and to driving gender-equity tax reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do need to do more. We know discrimination is rife when it comes to ageism, and older women are still very much disadvantaged—we know they pay for it. The difference in superannuation is quite substantial, and, incredibly, older women are the fastest growing group at risk of homelessness. It is unacceptable, when we think of this generation who has cared for us as a society, that they face such a prospect. We need to make sure we improve crisis accommodation, particularly in Warringah, and work to combat domestic violence, bullying and intimidation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also, obviously, the issue of refugees. We've had an intractable policy situation in Australia for some 20 years, and it was ironically formed on misinformation and disinformation at the very start. Who can forget the 'children overboard' misinformation used to sway an election and really harden Australians' views? It became this divisive debate instead of focusing on where our human rights are, what our obligations under international law are and what it means to be Australian. We should be a welcoming country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had so many years of policies of keeping people out, but we now find there is competition internationally to bring people to countries to help with jobs, skills and workforce shortages, so we actually need to think about growing Australia. I look forward to having more discussions with the government about increasing Australia's humanitarian intake and exploring all options to resettle asylum seekers. There are so many issues and challenges, but I look forward to working with the government in this term of parliament.</span>

                  <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  This morning I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of this land and pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. Together, Australians stand on the shoulders of 1,600 generations of First Nations people, and that is our shared history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has now been 1,229 days since I rose in this place for the first time and delivered my first address on behalf of the people of Lilley. Had you told me on that day what the next 1,229 days would have in store, I don't think I would have believed you. The Black Summer bushfires scorched the east coast of Australia; 100,000 women marched for justice, demanding action from a lethargic federal government who refused to listen; a global pandemic broke out and fundamentally shifted the way that we live and work; and northsiders battened down the hatches through waves of lockdowns, border closures, business interruptions, homeschooling, vaccine and RAT shortages, and an omicron summer that disrupted our desperately wished for plans to resume normality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The February floods ravaged South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales, and many of my constituents, like Mary from Deagon and Sarah from Sandgate, lost most of their possessions and were displaced from their homes. Northsiders showed resilience and many showed up to help their neighbours, like the infamous 'tinnie man' of Finnie Road in Deagon, who was ferrying Deagon residents through the floodwater to safety. On a personal note, last term, my first term in parliament, I gave birth to twins, Ossie and Dash, who turned two last month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past 1,229 days did not just create new challenges for all of our communities but turbocharged existing weaknesses and left the country crying out for a government with a vision for a better future. Despite the challenges of the last three years there have been many happy moments that have given us hope and propelled us forward. In my community the beginning of 2022 saw many much loved local events and traditions make their return across Lilley. The Bluewater Festival in Shorncliffe, the Einbunpin Festival in Sandgate, Banyo Diwali, Zillmere Festival, Nundah Festival and the Sandgate Youth Festival all returned with full force. In April we welcomed 120 babies born during the pandemic at Lilley's annual Welcoming the Babies event commenced 20 years ago by my predecessor Wayne Swan. At that event we commence my personal passion project, the Lilley Pram Pro Am, aka the running of the babies. In May the Lilley Honours List made a triumphant return, with a ceremony at Burnie Brae, where we recognised local flood heroes who went above and beyond during the floods in Northside. Moving forward the green-and-gold runway to the Brisbane 2032 Games paves the way for significant socioeconomic benefits that will last generations and help to drive Australia's post-COVID-19 recovery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the greatest conduit was the 2022 federal election. They say rain on your wedding day is a good omen, signifying a lasting marriage to come. Judging by the volume of rain that teemed down in Lilley during the last two weeks leading up to election day in May, hopefully it will prove to be a very good omen for what would become the Albanese government. Voters in Lilley backed federal Labor in record numbers in every suburb, from Brighton to Everton Park to Zillmere to Nundah. Voters turned out in record numbers at prepoll, with some queueing for two hours in the dark and rain to cast their ballot. This persistence highlighted Lilley's determination for change, with almost half of our electorate having cast a ballot at prepoll or via postal vote before 21 May. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When times are uncertain, people often cling to the familiar. They're reluctant to change governments or to take a risk or to try something new. But the voters in Lilley and, as it followed, in the rest of the country had realised in the wake of three years of challenge and turmoil that the Morrison government was not on the side and was simply no longer up to the job. They could not count on the coalition to deliver a better future for their families after a decade of rorts and failures. So, despite the appalling weather conditions, Lilley Labor volunteers showed up at the booths, in the mud, in their jackets, brollies up, drenched how-to-votes in their hands, never wavering in their commitment to rid the country of the tired Morrison government and elect the Albanese Labor government. We proudly campaigned on Labor's economic plan, from our commitment to rebuild Australian manufacturing to boosting wages and helping families with the cost of living by making child care cheaper. On aged care we promised to put security, dignity, equality and humanity back into aged care for older Australians, and I'm proud to now have been given the opportunity to deliver on that as the minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After three years of fighting for the people of Lilley on the Northside and in the parliament, we achieved a 9.92 two-party preferred swing and a 6.2 per cent primary swing to the Labor Party in Lilley. Our results would not have been achieved without the unwavering support of the Lilley Labor rank and file. Day after day members volunteering their time and energy turned up to campaign events to keep Lilley Labor but also with the hope that retaining Lilley as a part of the Northside Labor effort would help to secure an Albanese Labor government. Together, Lilley volunteers completed hundreds of home-baking sessions, hundreds of street stalls and 57 doorknocking sessions across every suburb in Lilley, having over 10,000 conversations with local residents. This was only possible thanks to the work of hundreds of volunteers and supporters. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My state and local colleagues, member for Aspley Bart Mellish, member for Sandgate Stirling Hinchliffe, member for Nudgee Leanne Linard, member for Stafford Jimmy Sullivan, and councillor for Deagon Ward and leader of Labor in the council Jared Cassidy, I thank you for your camaraderie and your support. To my staff—my beautiful, beautiful staff—Cath, Justin, Deanne, Summer, Marian, Rhyana, Sophia, Shayne, Saxon and Declan, thank you for sticking by me and seeing it through. You deal with some very complex and shifting sands in the Lilley electorate, not least because of my three young children, and you do it with grace, with dignity and with passion. I could not do any of this without you. I thank you so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my campaign manager, Bisma Asif, who helped drive our phenomenal field campaign to new heights and ensured we delivered our message right across the north side, I thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Queensland Labor Party office team, particularly to Mitchell Kingston, who was the driver of strategy behind our campaign to take Lilley from the most marginal seat in Queensland to a hard-fought 10.5 per cent margin—I thank you very much, along with Julie-Ann Campbell and Zac Beers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Faye Clark and Anne Marlay, Warren Derrington and Kate Derrington, Matt Fortey and Russell, who braved the cold and rainy conditions day after day for the entire two weeks of prepolling—you know I love you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Usama Shafiq, Aamna Asif, Emma Babao, Frank Scattini, Scott Macleod and Luke Richmond formed the core of the field team who made all of those calls and knocked on all of those doors. I thank Tom Hinchliffe, Quinn Storrie, Saxon Kliendienst, Will Henderson, Graham Appleton, Walter Kuhn, Jared and Rod, who worked extremely hard to ensure operation yard signs was efficient, getting 150 signs erected in various parts of the electorate at very short notice and in very short time frames.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank to the stoic volunteers who spent election eve setting up voting booths in the rain only to back it up the following day by staffing them. My thanks to the hundreds of people on election day who staffed the booths from before 8 am to after 6 pm, handing out how-to-vote cards and talking to the voters about a better future under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my family, particularly Finn—I'm going to lose it now—who has been an absolute pillar in our lives. None of this would have been possible without everything that you do with your continuous sacrifice, your love and your support—I thank you. To Celeste, who is very upset she is not here with us this week, but who now has her own commitments with prep and her own diary program to adhere to—I love you, my darling, and I hope you are proud.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who have not been singled out for a mention in the speech—however, that does not diminish the contributions that they have made. It goes to show the sheer scale of the community you need to run a campaign, and that goes for every single community in the 151 electorates that we represent here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will touch briefly on the budget process because this is my first opportunity since we handed down the budget. It's the first federal Labor budget in nearly a decade; a budget that feels like a breath of fresh air, I hope, after a decade of waste and rorts; a budget that delivers on our promise to build a better future for all Australians; a responsible, family-friendly budget that helps Australians with the cost of living; a budget that helps deliver cheaper medicine, fee-free TAFE and a future made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time since the coalition government scrapped it in 2014, the Albanese government brought back gender-responsive budgeting. The Albanese government knows that for real economic change women need to be part of the policy-making and part of the decision-making, and I'm very proud to have a seat around that table now. Australian women will no longer be an afterthought when planning Australia's economic future. The Albanese Labor government is extending paid parental leave and cutting the cost of child care. These are crucial economic reforms that we are doing that will boost workforce participation for women and make things just a little bit easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't be prouder to be part of the federal Labor government ready to build a better future. We won't let down the Australians who have put their faith in us, and I will continue to do my best to reward the trust that the people of Lilley have placed in me for this, my second term.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me on this glorious day not to congratulate the Socceroos on their stunning victory, their iconic victory, their very deserving victory in the early hours of this morning. Australians have copped quite a lot of chat about our soccer ability in recent months, but I never lost the faith and neither did any of the thousands of people that gathered in places like Federation Square in the early hours of this morning. The twins were asleep in two travel cots beside my bed in the hotel room, so I was watching it in a very different manner to the first game I got to see in Doha against France. While the two different experiences have formative and lasting memories for me, I note here in this place a moment in the first game against France when Awer Mabil and Garang Kuol were subbed on in the late end of the second half. You could see, as they waited together to run on, what a special moment it was for them. I got to see them later at base camp. They said they were just so proud that they got to do that for their communities in that moment, and I got to say to them, 'To me, your community is Australia, and I hope you know how many Australians felt that magic and that pride in that same moment, watching and waiting for you to run on and represent us all on the pitch.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, that Mathew Leckie goal in the 60th minute was one of the goals of the World Cup. Then there's Mat Ryan and the pressure that he has to withstand as goalkeeper. It is astounding what he does both as goalkeeper and as captain. I got to meet his family in Doha. They are good people. Eight of them travelled from Sydney to Doha to support our captain. I send a shout-out to Megan, his sister, who does good work for us in community sport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Harry Souttar and all the defensive players, who withstood such ferocious attacks from Denmark last night and in our earlier matches against Tunisia and France, I say: you might not get the glory of the goal, but we recognise your efforts and we are so proud. To Arnie, JJ, Mark and Team Australia, who are based over at Aspire Academy, led by national icon Timmy Cahill, I say: thank you for everything that you are doing to bring our boys home and to give us these opportunities that have really captured the imagination of the nation today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth noting here in the federal parliament the national significance in Australian sporting history of what they have now achieved. We are through to the final 16 for only the second time in our history, and they are the only two consecutive wins Australia has ever managed in our World Cup history. It is an iconic and deserving victory from a young side, and we are so proud of you. I hope you are not watching the federal parliament. I hope you are getting some sleep and some Weet-Bix. I hope you are not listening to me, but, just in case you are: 'Hello, legends! We are so, so proud of you. Thank you for everything that you have done, and thank you for giving us all, like I said to you at training, these moments of magic that light up the whole nation. Thank you for doing that for us on an average Thursday morning here in November. We can't wait to support you against Argentina on Sunday morning. I am already seeing that Adelaide Oval will go live. I am hearing perhaps the Sydney Opera House will go live as a site for supporters to gather. You have the whole country behind you. Congratulations on everything that you have achieved, and good luck.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Almost nine years ago, in December 2013, I had the immense honour of standing up to deliver my maiden speech to the federal parliament as the newly elected member for Capricornia. It was an amazing privilege to return to parliament and rise in the new 47th parliament of Australia, having once again been re-elected, for an historic fourth term, as the region's federal representative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I reflect on the recent election campaign and the hard work and determination of all of those committed volunteers, friends, family and staff who supported me, I am eternally grateful. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to: my family, Jessica, Tim and Kirstin, and my parents, Bill and Gloria Martin; our incredible Liberal and National supporters and volunteers; our dedicated booth workers, including my campaign manager, Shannon Clein, Treasurer John Rogers, Secretary Julie Murphy, Ron Carige, Vicki Bastin-Byrne; and of course my dedicated staff, Nicole Neale, Tom Birkbeck, Jake Ash, Cody Vella, Owen Wyte, Lauren Clein, Laurie Atlas, Nicholas McDougall and Amiee Forde. I also say a huge thank you to all of those who financially contributed to my campaign and helped in any way that they could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my federal parliamentary colleagues for their unwavering support, including: former prime minister and member for Cook, Scott Morrison; former deputy prime minister and member for New England, Barnaby Joyce; former deputy prime minister and member for Riverina, Michael McCormack; Leader of the Nationals and member for Maranoa, David Littleproud; Senator Bridget McKenzie; and the new members that neighbour Capricornia, the member for Dawson, Andrew Willcox, and the member for Flynn, Colin Boyce. I say a special thank you to Senator Matthew Canavan and his team for their unwavering friendship and support, as always. I wish to express my gratitude to the quiet Australians who voted for me: the small-business owners, the mums and dads, the coalminers, the farmers and the retirees. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was such an honour to serve as the Assistant Minister for Children and Families, the Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism and the Assistant Minister for Northern Australia in the 46th Parliament of Australia. I'm thrilled to start this new term of parliament as the shadow assistant minister for manufacturing. This new role is especially important because manufacturing is already a major contributor to our economy, generating over $113 billion in value in 2020-21 and more than $50 billion in exports. Manufacturing accounts for about a quarter of national research and development investment. Since becoming Capricornia's federal MP, I have worked tirelessly to secure major investment in real job-creating infrastructure. We have committed federal funding for projects including the Rockhampton Ring Road, the Walkerston Bypass—which is underway—and the completed Mackay Ring Road. We have also invested in numerous community projects and, of course, in Rookwood Weir—a project that took years of campaigning to make it a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Water is a priority in Central Queensland. Projects like Rookwood Weir near Rockhampton must go ahead to create long-term jobs. The Rookwood Weir project is underway, and it's going to transform the Rockhampton region, driving the expansion of irrigated agricultural production and opening up new business opportunities, which will boost the local economy. The weir's approximately 86,000 megalitres of water will underpin agricultural growth and deliver secure, reliable and affordable water across Central Queensland, setting up local industry to succeed. I have been impressed by the willingness of the coalition to front up with the money for projects like this through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. Millions of dollars have been committed to ensuring that our dry continent can continue to be not only liveable but productive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Rookwood Weir project was one of the first to receive capital funding from the fund, national water infrastructure must continue to be built. I was proud during the recent election to join my colleague the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, in announcing $483 million for the Urannah dam near Collinsville. This dam would unlock 103 gigalitres of water, enabling local producers to develop up to 20,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture. Urannah dam is a must-do project for Central and North Queensland, and I believe the state and federal governments must do everything they can to see this underway as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the new Prime Minister seeking confirmation that he will honour the coalition's funding commitments for Capricornia that were outlined in the federal budget—including for Urannah Dam. Unfortunately, the budget has confirmed my worst fears, with the funding for Urannah ripped away, along with $10 billion in vital regional projects. As well as the $483 million for the Urannah dam near Collinsville, other commitments in the coalition's budget earlier this year included $14.4 million to replace the Philips Creek bridge on Saraji Road, which will improve safety and year-round accessibility; and $100,000 for the rebuild of the Collinsville CWA, which is an essential community centre for the Collinsville community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition also committed $2.9 million to fund Archer Street drainage scheme stages 1 and 2, which will improve the flood resilience of up to 70 commercial and residential buildings and low-lying areas around Archer Street in Rockhampton. There was also $2.8 million to deliver stage 1 of the Nebo Showgrounds master plan, which includes primary infrastructure upgrades, construction of heavy vehicle access, general camping upgrades and car parking; and $5 million for new veteran wellness services in Kinchant Waters, in the Mackay region, to benefit veterans, defence personnel and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of road upgrades, there were commitments for $400 million to improve Queensland beef road corridors, which included the sealing of Clermont-Alpha Road, May Downs Road and Kilcummin Diamond Downs Road; and $6.18 million to upgrade Artillery Road and Greenlake Road, with approximately two kilometres of pavement widening and floodway and alignment upgrades. We also committed $795,000 to MRAEL for their CYCLE—creating youth change and leading engagement—program to reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour in Rockhampton; and almost $7.7 million for better telecommunications, including for the Pioneer Valley in Mackay Regional Council, Pasha in Isaac Regional Council and the Livingston Shire Council agriculture precinct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A considerable amount of time and effort, both locally and in Canberra, was put into developing the case for a variety of projects. I have to thank our local media, including CQ Today, Channel 7, WIN News, ABC Capricornia, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mercury</span>, ABC Tropical North, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Morning Bulletin</span>, Southern Cross Austereo, ARN and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mackay and Whitsunday Life</span>. Each of us un this place owes some debt to our local media, and their devotion to what our local communities need is one of the things that keeps each of us accountable to the people we represent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Albanese Labor government has seen fit to cut Capricornia off at the knees by cutting millions of dollars of funding from the electorate. The Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure have delayed vital funding for years for the Rockhampton Ring Road, a $1 billion transformational infrastructure project that has been on the books for many years. Thousands of trucks move through Rockhampton and must contend with over 20 sets of traffic lights. Our local Queensland Labor members for Rockhampton should hang their heads in shame for not fighting their masters in Brisbane and Canberra to get this funding reinstated. At least the Queensland infrastructure minister gets his Cross River Rail—at the expense of the safety of motorists in Central Queensland. Capricornia funds the nation, but it seems the nation won't fund Capricornia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, in one of many short-sighted decisions, also decided to cut $10 billion from regional programs, including the regional development plan, Regional Accelerator Program, community development grants and the Building Better Regions Fund. The Albanese government has also seen fit to provide $32 million to progress consultation and planning with the Queensland government for water infrastructure options in Central Queensland and the Burdekin region. This reads to me that they will be helping the Queensland government shove people out of their homes, in the Pioneer Valley, with their half baked hydro scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes what our region has needed most has not been a project of concrete and steel but essential services to ensure regional families are supported. In the last term of parliament, I was proud to secure $8 million for the Fitzroy Community Hospice. This 12-bed facility, based in Rockhampton, will be the first regional hospice in the state and will provide dedicated, holistic end-of-life care in the community and support families and carers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with staff on the border of the Fitzroy Community Hospice last year and am pleased this centre, when it is up and running, will be able to support and guide patients and their families through the most difficult of times. I fought hard for this service. It is absolutely crucial that comprehensive access to community based palliative care is available in Central Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last term, one of my proudest achievements as the member for Capricornia was officially launching a new headspace satellite service in Sarina. I wanted our young people in Sarina to know that they were not alone on their journey. Headspace delivers quality frontline support and ensures the best possible care for people at risk. The headspace program has improved access for young people aged 12 to 25 who are at risk of mental illness. One in four people aged 16 to 24 experiences some form of mental illness every year and three-quarters of all mental illness manifests in people under the age of 25. The service, located at 1/71 Broad Street, Sarina, was announced as part of the coalition government's $111.3 million funding commitment to establish 30 new headspace services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have secured funding for transformative local infrastructure projects that are completed, underway or in the pipeline. A few of these are: $5 million to Signature Onfarm beef for a processing facility, creating more jobs with $25 million in additional NAIF funding; $325,000 to Collinsville CWA for the new community hall; $230,000 to Clermont kindergarten for a physical environment upgrade; and $3.2 million to support the redevelopment of the Clermont saleyards and showgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding on the Capricorn Coast includes: $10 million to the Livingston Shire Council for the Yeppoon foreshore precinct and CBD revitalisation; $20 million to the Keppel Bay Sailing Club for a 650-seat convention centre; $64 million for upgrades on Yeppoon Road; $25 million for Alliance Airlines' repair and maintenance facility in Rockhampton; $5 million for the Rockhampton Airport upgrades; $7 million for the Rockhampton Hospital car park; $10 million for the Rockhampton art gallery; and $852 million for the Rockhampton Ring Road. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Mackay region, funding includes: almost $10 million to CQUniversity for a world-class sports precinct at Ooralea; $120 million for the Walkerston bypass; nearly $654,000 to Wests Tigers Leagues Club for an undercover bowls green; $300,000 to the Palmyra Dragway for track upgrades and repairs, following Cyclone Debbie; and $50,000 for the Finch Hatton emergency airstrip. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Serving as the member for Capricornia has been the honour of my life. As MPs in this place we all have the ability to make a real difference in our electorates by supporting local residents who need a bit of assistance, by improving the essential services that our families rely and by fighting for major infrastructure projects that have the potential to create jobs and strengthen our communities. On every single one of these benchmarks I am immensely proud of what I've been able to secure as an MP. But it's not just in my role as the member for Capricornia where I've worked hard to achieve positive outcomes. During the previous term of the coalition government I was the Assistant Minister the Children and Families. This was a portfolio which gave me incredible opportunity to work directly with community leaders, providers and frontline staff who work hard every single day to deliver crucial support to the most vulnerable children in Australia. During the onslaught of the global COVID-19 pandemic the challenges that this sector faced were enormous, and I would like to pay tribute and thank the sector today for their leadership, resilience, courage and dedication. It was inspirational to see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the responsibilities of government one of the most critical priorities is to keep our kids safe. The latest stats from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that we still have a long way to go on this front, especially when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, who continue to be massively overrepresented in the child protection systems, and the 46,000 children and young people in out-of-home care. As Assistant Minister the Children and Families I knew that to forge a positive way forward on child safety it was important to build a template to help us get there. That's why in December last year I was thrilled to welcome the federal government's launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Safe </span><span style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Supported</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">national framework for protecting</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australia's children</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021-2031</span>. This framework is a crucial piece of work that we negotiated with the states and territories as well as Indigenous leaders and the family sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we managed to achieve a great deal during our time in government and we can reflect on our successes, we must not rest on our laurels. There is more to do and there is much more for the people of Capricornia to look forward to. I want to see the Rockhampton Airport eventually become an international airport. The runway is already the right length, so all we need is the Customs workforce with increased agricultural exports and tourism interest in the Central Queensland region. With projects like Rookwood Weir nearing completion to help the region grow more crops and a renewed interest in Great Keppel Island as a target for development, I'm confident we will see Rockhampton Airport be able to handle international passengers in the short to medium term. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Capricornia we have a severe lack of sporting infrastructure for local sporting teams to train and play on due to inaction by the Queensland state Labor government. This is why the previous coalition government committed $23 million to a new sports stadium in Rockhampton. I have committed to seeing it built and available for us not just for sports but for live international acts and as a convention space. The Shoalwater Bay training area expansion is nearing completion, and it will be the most sophisticated military training area in the southern hemisphere. Once it's completed, the region will need a permanent military presence to deliver economic benefits to the region and put Australia's defence posture in good stead. This is something I will be lobbying hard for. I'll also fight to see more social housing built in Capricornia. Central Queensland has been in a housing crisis for some time, and, while the previous coalition government provided record funding to the Queensland Labor government, they have let the region down and done nothing with that funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Capricornia is the electorate where I was raised and where I decided to raise my daughter and my eight-week-old new grandson. This community I truly love. I will continue to work hard for Capricornia and hold the incoming Labor government to account on the plethora of promises that were made for Central Queensland. Capricornia has a great future, and I am honoured to represent it in the 47th Parliament. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I'm delighted to speak today in response to the Albanese Labor government's first budget. Deputy Speaker Freelander, I was first elected along with you to this place in July 2016 and have watched six budgets delivered by those opposite. This is the first budget where I can proudly say I am part of the government and an Albanese prime ministership. I am proud to see a Labor budget that puts people back at the centre of our nation's focus. This budget respects workers and values industry and business. We are taking action to ensure our economic and environmental prosperity moving forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people are not really interested, truth be told, in the national budget as they go about their daily lives. They are unsure what it means for them. As the headlines come and go and they hear the narrative on the news and in their social media feeds, it's mostly just political traffic—in one ear and out the other. But they do desperately care how the budget impacts their lives. So I want to take this opportunity to have a conversation about the Labor budget and what it means for a typical family in my electorate of Paterson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget means that a single parent or a single-income family, a couple, seeking for both parents to be active in the workforce can have the support they need from their government to be confident they can afford quality child care and increase their household income. One of the things I often hear when people in my community talk to me is: 'Meryl, the roads are shocking and child care is so expensive.' Well, we're doing something about that expense, which is one of the biggest expenses, outside of mortgage payments or rent, in household budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our national budget means that workers on the minimum wage will be better able to meet the cost of living and will have, importantly, more money in their super when they retire. I was certainly no fan of the previous government enabling the raiding of super, because, whilst it might seem really important at the time, the ramifications—the loss of all that compound interest—can have absolutely devastating effects on people when they retire. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is making medicines cheaper and more affordable for Australians by reducing the cost of prescription medications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will support new and expecting parents to have more parental leave during the vital first 20 weeks of their child's life. Deputy Speaker, I know that you, as a former paediatrician, and I have had many long and meaningful conversations about the importance of the first 5,000 days of life and how we need to give those beautiful new souls every opportunity to prosper and grow. This government's budget supports new parents. As one of those who are well beyond the bleary-eyed years of 'peak parenting', as I call it, I say to new parents: 'Hang in there! It does get easier, and this government is trying to make it better for you by giving you parental leave. It's the hardest but the best job that anyone can ever do.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that gets on with fixing the mess that is the former government's botched NBN. Thanks to the policy passion of my colleague and friend Minister Michelle Rowland, we will see full fibre access to 1.5 million homes and businesses by 2025. I can only think how different the experience of COVID might have been for so many people who worked from home and children who were at home if we'd had a fully functioning fibre NBN. It could have been so much more interactive, so much more responsive—it could have been so different had the NBN been done well in the first place. It wasn't. Now we're going to fix that issue, and fix it we must.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget will deliver on a Voice to Parliament, committing funding to promote the referendum, including for the Electoral Commission to conduct an enrolment drive among Indigenous Australians. In recent days I've spoken to a number of people who've said to me, 'But, Meryl, we don't know the detail.' I understand that that is important, but can I ask people to broaden their thinking on the Voice to Parliament. It is akin to having children. You have your first child and think, 'I could never love anything more than this being.' Then you have your second child and think: 'My heart has grown. I love this one just as much as the other one.' The member for Canberra is here in the chamber. She could attest to this—and far more recently—with her two magnificent children. You think: 'I've grown as a person. My heart is bigger. I'm better for this experience.' It's like when you get a new dog and it's a puppy, and you think, 'Oh, this dog! It's chewing up everything!' But your heart gets bigger and that becomes an old, faithful dog, and you think, 'My God, what an experience. How would I have lived my life without this?' This is, I feel, what the Voice will do for our country. It will make us better. It will grow our hearts. We are big enough and mature enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no diminution of our country from recognising our First Peoples of this land. There is no downside. There is only betterment for us all to be on this journey together. So I say to each and every Australian: look to your heart. Allow your heart to be bigger and more generous. There is no downside for any of us giving our First Nations people a voice in this parliament. Making that decision table a little bigger will only make the meal that we all share so much better for all Australians. Be part of it, don't shy away from it and please don't be scared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making it easier for senior Australians to return to the workforce, if they wish to, without fear of financial penalties to their retirement savings or pensions, thus returning experience and expertise to the employment pool. Again, I think this is a such a brilliant thing, and I implore every experienced Australian, as I like to call them: if you're thinking that you might like to return to the workforce, get back amongst it. Some of these young'uns will do well to take heed of your life experience. And that whole 'interweb' thing—don't be worried about that, don't be shy, don't be frightened. Just get in there and give it a go. Your experience, and the miles that you've walked in your moccasins, will bring an energy back to business and back to the workforce of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to businesses: take a punt on someone who's over 50 in your business. You will be rewarded by their experience. They've got more energy than you think they do. They will bring depth to your workforce and perhaps even a different kind of ingenuity. They can fix things with wire. They've got practical experience. Give them a crack at your business; you just don't know the benefits that could come your way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are ensuring more senior Australians can access a seniors health care card as well. We're also ensuring self-funded retirees won't be penalised, by making it easier for them to qualify for a seniors health care card by increasing the threshold, and that's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the white noise from those opposite, this is a budget that delivers on Labor's commitment to the Australian people. We now have a Prime Minister who is working for his fellow Australians. I want to make special reference to a couple of conversations I've had again this week. The first one was with the owner of Angove wines. I was at the Australian Organic Industry Awards in the Hunter region last Friday evening, and he said to me, 'Meryl, I'm not a traditional Labor voter, but I voted for Anthony Albanese last election. Can I say to you, in my opinion, he hasn't put a foot wrong.' Thank you for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a second conversation with a friend, who said, 'Albanese, or Albo, as you like to call him, Meryl'—I call him the Prime Minister these days—'has those rare qualities of leadership and humility.' It is so rare. It is such a silken thread to be a leader and also humble. It's a delicate balance, but I think he is really doing that, and doing it very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most personal commitments made by Labor, for me, was the commitment to ensure a better life for residents of aged care. My own mother spent her last eight months in an aged-care facility until, sadly, passing away earlier this year. It will be my family's first Christmas without both of our parents, and it will be difficult, but I know that she led a really terrific life, living to 90. Whilst in the care and support of the Royal Freemasons' Benevolent Institution masonic village at Kurri Kurri, she had really brilliant care. The village exceeded my expectations, and enough hadn't been done by previous governments to support the hardworking staff at these kinds of facilities. They do this selfless work. They are passionate about dignity and respect for all people in their most senior years, and as a government we must support them. That's why our budget has delivered on our commitment to listen and act on the needs of this workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering $2.5 billion to mandate a minimum number of care minutes for nursing home residents and to employ a registered nurse on site 24/7. As someone who has slept on a foldout couch beside my mother in her final days, I can only tell you how incredibly angst filled it is for those people. There are buzzers and bells going off through the night, people having falls. These things just happen in aged-care facilities, not because people aren't being well cared for but because, as we get older, the risks are higher. We have been forcing carers in aged-care facilities to constantly make these choices—'Do I stay here and make sure this person is in their pyjamas and in the right position for bed and all settled while I've got someone else buzzing, desperately needing to be helped out of a chair, or someone who needs to be toileted or showered?' These are real and everyday pressures that aged-care workers face. Not only do we need to train them well and pay them well; we need to support them in the work that they do. I give my personal thanks to you and wish you a blessed and happy Christmas. For those that are helping our elderly over this holiday season, I thank you for that, spending time away from your own loved ones while caring for the loved ones of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy to invest over $800 million to provide 480,000 fee-free TAFE places will be groundbreaking. It ensures trades and expertise into the future, ensuring the sustainability of professions to keep the country going, quite frankly. The skills and trade industry has been neglected for far too long. Returning opportunities into this sector is vital and well overdue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly turn my attention to students attending Kurri Kurri TAFE and Maitland TAFE. Whether you're studying water or energy management, or whether you're studying viticulture at Kurri Kurri TAFE and producing some of those magnificent award-winning intuition branded wines, good on you. You are learning a craft. You are gaining skills that will contribute immeasurably to our country. We need you to keep learning. TAFE is one of the best places to do it, and this Albanese Labor government is backing you. We're backing your TAFE place. We want you to live the best life you can live contributing through your trade. Thank you for getting on the tools for your country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Australian dream was always to own your own home. In many cities this has now become, sadly, a pipedream, as wages stagnate and housing prices skyrocket. The solution of the former government was to raid your super. As I said earlier, I do not think that was the way forward for Australians. Reducing security in retirement or hitting up Mum and Dad—I think I remember a former Prime Minister saying that perhaps parents could help out to buy a home. Well, you know what? When I grew up and as those who are younger than me grow up, mum and dad mercantile isn't an option for most ordinary Australians. This is where the government comes in. Poor policy provides poor results. Our government provides, in the budget, opportunities for homeownership that are achievable. We are delivering a plan, working with all levels of government, that will deliver an estimated one million new homes over five years from 2024. We will ensure more affordable housing is delivered to support first home buyers. We will look at diversity in housing choices that open up windows across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In keeping with our climate commitments, the first Labor budget has renewable energy as one of its key priorities. Like many other items in the budget, the government has followed through on its commitment to clean energy, with $800 million earmarked for a range of projects. This includes previously promised cuts to taxes on electric cars, improving electric vehicle charging network infrastructure and providing community batteries and solar banks. I note that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy is in the House today. I thank him because I was a particularly passionate advocate for making sure that we could have a fleet of electric vehicles as the fleet vehicles of the nation. To be able to get our businesses into electric cars was an important priority. I am really, really pleased to see that come through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget also includes $500,000 to be spent in the next year to develop a strategy to, in the future, enable the government to support offshore renewable projects in Australian waters. I am extremely pleased about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the pillars of our democracy is journalism, and one of the most important assets to regional Australians is the national broadcaster, the ABC, or 'Aunty', as most of us like to refer to it as. I was delighted to attend the first ABC showcase since COVID, and we were celebrating 90 years of the ABC. I actually worked at the ABC when we celebrated 70 years, so I was reminded of the amazing work and the incredible talent and commitment the ABC family brings to our lives every day. Current affairs, up-to-date breaking news and outstanding Australian drama is all just part of the package of the ABC. I stand here as a parliamentarian who is particularly proud of our national broadcaster, and I will support it until my dying breath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many would recall funding was cut by the coalition government in 2018. That saw the ABC cut 250 jobs, making their world-class delivery difficult and sometimes nigh on impossible. We are fulfilling our pre-election promise to restore $83.7 million over four years in funding to the ABC. This will ensure that the ABC remains a safe and secure broadcaster that can fearlessly report on current events as well as support future Australian talent and education. I just want to say that all democracy is built on that great excellence of freedom of speech and impartiality. Without the ABC in Australia, I fear the worst for not only our broadcasters but also our system of democracy. I can't tell you how much I value that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pillar of the Labor budget is our commitment to women and gender equality. We have a Prime Minister and a ministerial team who are putting women's safety front and centre. That's why our budget will focus on women's safety initiatives, including $39.6 million in the next financial year to keep up with the sadly increased demand for crisis payments for people escaping violence. I just want to say, especially to people like those working at Carrie's Place in my electorate: I hear you. I understand what you go through on a daily basis supporting the women of Maitland and surrounding areas. I think it is wrong that as part of your armoury in helping women you have to have a shelf of tents and sleeping bags, such is the dire state of our short-term accommodation for people fleeing violence. It isn't right and, as a government, we are working to make this situation so much better than it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am just so proud to be here as the member for Paterson, and there are so many more things that I would love to tell you about but time doesn't permit. We have delivered sporting facilities. We have delivered critical investments in the Port Stephens koala population that mean that we are going to help conserve those koalas into the future. We are helping people with cancer. We are helping veterans in my electorate. I am very pleased to see the minister for health at the table as I say that we have delivered an MRI licence for the new Maitland Hospital. Thank you, Minister, for that. We are progressing the remediation of PFAS, and I thank the Assistant Minister for Defence, Minister Thistlethwaite, for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but not least, I want to thank my wonderful constituents, my beautiful staff who manage my electorate office and my fabulous colleagues, frontbench and backbench. All of you, have a safe, joyous and Merry Christmas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will do this through a voice to parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as frightening as that bushfire season was, the absence of action will see the temperatures and conditions of that year become normal by the 2040s and become a 'good year' by the 2060s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing rainfall and worsening heat will make our world-class agricultural sector less productive and harder to work. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, Australia is a developed country most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including bushfires and floods, so the stakes are extremely high.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not acting would be an unforgivable act of intergenerational negligence. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And while Australia has a lot to lose from climate change, as a good international citizen we care deeply about our region and the impacts of climate everywhere. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Natural disasters are taking an increasing toll on our friends and neighbours. Salt water is invading fresh water supplies.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Important in our agenda was the passage of the Climate Change Act, showing the world that Australia is open for business, with a stable investment environment to unleash billions of dollars of renewable energy investment and zero emissions technology.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the authority recommends that the government begin work on a plan to guide the nation's efforts towards achieving net zero, which we agree with and will prepare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority also points out that, while technology exists to meet our 2030 targets, there are significant labour market and supply chain challenges, as every country around the world strives to meet their targets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we agree. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing the training and investment in clean energy and decarbonising our workforce was a major focus of our Jobs and Skills Summit in July. Our policy of 10,000 new energy apprentices, which we're implementing, is a great start, but we know more needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring access to resources and supply chain has also been a key focus of my first six months as minister, particularly in my work with my fellow energy ministers from the Quad countries. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, while reducing emissions will always be the most important agenda, the fact is that the climate has already changed and will keep changing, and we must adapt. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So more leadership is necessary. We need a comprehensive plan for adaptation and climate risk assessment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have time to waste to take advantage of the opportunities which come with climate action, especially for our regions. We must prepare, adapt and take advantage of the opportunities as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  As set out in the Climate Change Act of 2022, the minister is to deliver an annual climate change statement to the parliament. The minister has just delivered that statement—indeed, he has delivered this parliament's inaugural climate change statement, and I congratulate him on reaching that milestone. A unique feature of any reflection on climate change in the context of Australia expressed at this very moment, with consideration of the prior 12-month period, is that it straddles two governments and therefore tells the tale of two vastly different approaches. Since one government was the coalition and the other Labor, each with about six months in office within that 12-month period, a compare and contrast is called for, and I shall do that by making some comments at the end of this contribution about the coalition's approach to this challenge moving forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, though, let me recognise where there is in fact a high degree of commonality in this parliament—a unity of purpose, if you like—between members of the House, regardless of their political stripe or where they may sit in the chamber. That is, every member wants to leave the world a better place than how they found it; everybody wants to see a future with a cleaner planet. Every parliamentarian, I believe, without exception wants to make a positive contribution to achieving these aspirations, for many of the reasons outlined already by the minister and, therefore, I shall not repeat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with him in welcoming our international friends who have joined us in the chamber today, and I thank them for their friendship to Australia and, indeed, their friendship in very much a bipartisan fashion with successful governments over such a long period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an important place to start—recognising that people come to the issue of climate change in very different ways, from different places and with different views. But that does not mean that any one person's intent is bad with respect to the health of the planet, the health of the human race or the health of the economy. But the question of how we can seek to tackle the challenges that arise from these shared aspirations is where we start to see a divergence. So it's only appropriate that we do compare and contrast the outcomes of the former coalition government and the current Labor government with respect to climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government's record is remarkable. It acted on climate change and managed the decarbonisation of the Australian economy in a way that was balanced and responsible. In 2021-22, as the coalition's time in office was concluding, Australia's annual carbon emissions had reduced by 77 million tonnes from when the coalition was first elected in 2013. That drop of 77 million tonnes meant that, under the coalition, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions fell by over 20 per cent on 2005 levels—an amazing outcome and something that all Australians have every right to feel very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leadership counts here, so let me pay tribute to the coalition energy ministers who delivered such outcomes, including Greg Hunt, Josh Frydenberg and Angus Taylor, each of whom distinguished themselves as climate and energy leaders in this country. Their policies, from the Direct Action Fund to the Technology Investment Roadmap, delivered continuous investments in energy efficiency, battery storage, and carbon capture and storage programs that put Australia on the right path. As a nation, we smashed our Kyoto emissions targets, and we ensured Australia was well on track to exceed its commitments under the Paris Agreement—an agreement that the coalition signed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also the coalition, of course, which first took the responsible action to partner with Australia's neighbours, particularly, on climate change mitigation. At COP26 in 2021—a COP which an Australian prime minister had the courtesy to attend—Australia doubled its climate finance commitment to $2 billion over 2020 to 2025, with at least $700 million of this for climate and disaster finance in the Pacific. A hallmark of the coalition government was how it struck the right balance between delivering record carbon abatement while strengthening the Australian economy at the same time. This is not an easy feat, as I know the Labor government is now discovering. While emissions reduced to record levels, Australia's GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2.5 per cent, before the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was one of the highest growth rates among the OECD. We maintained our AAA credit rating and we brought unemployment rates down to their lowest levels in nearly 50 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the keys to achieving this was keeping energy prices down. Over the last term of the coalition government alone, prices dropped for households by eight per cent, for businesses by 10 per cent and for industry by 12 per cent. Electricity prices dropped to an eight-year low under the coalition as we reduced pressure on households, lowered costs for businesses and kept Australian industry competitive internationally. One of the ways we kept prices down was by helping facilitate a rapid growth in the supply of gas. It's why we've been offering the government a gratuitous tip since day one in opposition: supply, supply, supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there were renewables, for which investments soared under the coalition. Electricity generation for wind and solar increased by 363 per cent in the years the coalition was in government—to repeat, that's 363 per cent. In fact, when it comes to renewable energy as a share of total electricity generation, Australia hit a record high under the coalition. Indeed, Australia punched well above its weight, especially considering our grid does not have the benefit of stabilising itself by connecting to other countries that offer low-cost, safe, clean sources of energy such as nuclear. Under the coalition, we had the highest rate of rooftop solar installation in the world, and a growing list of willing energy investors ready to make major investments in large-scale renewable energy projects right across Australia. Large-scale solar, wind farms both onshore and offshore, hydropower battery storage, and hydrogen—Australia was well and truly on the radar for investors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And which of the two governments we are discussing here today delivered these outcomes? It was the coalition government. That's because we did the hard work. The coalition took advice. We listened to and heard from the experts. We planned and we executed. It might sound simple, but not all governments take such an approach. And this is probably a good segue into the second tale of the story of the last six months—the second chapter in Australia's climate and energy policy. Just over six months ago, the Albanese Labor government came to office in a big rush to take the nation in a different direction—and it has certainly done that, at least in the area of climate change and energy policy. They hit the ground running with a raft of changes, the effects of which the Australian people are now starting to feel. The government are good at selling the vision thing, I give them that. But where they let the Australian people down is on the delivery. After nine years of naysaying, the Labor Party failed to do the heavy lifting on policy formulation, and Australian households and businesses are suffering the consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has maintained the coalition's net zero target by 2050 and set a new 43 per cent target by 2030, which also assumes an electricity generation target of 82 per cent from renewables. This, by the minister's own admission, requires the installation of 22,000 solar panels every single day and 40 wind turbines every single month all the way up to 2030, along with tens of thousands of kilometres of transmission lines carpeted over regional Australia. In setting these grand targets, however, the government lacked an implementation plan and any credible economic modelling to back it up—despite having nine years to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does the government's plan account for supply chain issues with materials? No. Does it account for shortages of skilled human resources to deliver on the plan? No. Does it account for the views of regional communities that will be most impacted? No. The government has a vision—tick. It has a target to match—tick. But it lacks a plan, and we're already seeing the impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government made a commitment to the Australian people at the election that it would reduce energy bills by 18 per cent, and for the Australian household that averaged to a reduction in household power bills by $275—a commitment that was made no less than 97 times in the lead up to this year's federal election. It took the government's own budget papers in October for it to realise what the rest of Australia already knew—energy prices had started to go through the roof and are going to get even worse. Now we know electricity bills are set to rise by another 56 per cent and gas by 44 per cent by next year. How does that reconcile with the government's promise of an 18 per cent reduction, you might ask. Well, it doesn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same RepuTex modelling that the government used to make its promise of lower energy bills also led the government to promise the creation of over 600,000 new jobs as a result of its Powering Australia policy. But the Australian Workers Union has recently warned that these soaring power prices threaten 800,000 jobs of manufacturing workers in Australia. How does the threat of 800,000 lost jobs reconcile with the government's promise of 600,000 new jobs? Well, it doesn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at renewables, recognising that this government promotes itself as a champion of renewable energy. Contrary to their sales messaging, renewable energy investment has slowed. According to data from the Clean Energy Council, financial closure of new renewable energy projects has fallen in Labor's first six months in government. In recent statements to a Senate estimates committee, the Clean Energy Regulator confirmed even rooftop solar installations are now down. It may come as a surprise, but the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has now declared it is once again in a position where it is offering financial deals to wind farms as these are having difficulty arranging finance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the reliability of the grid, the government's Powering Australia policy gave assurances about the reliability and security of the network but, after just one month in government, the grid began to wobble. The minister came out publicly to placate community concern, showing them there was no threat and the system was okay. But within a week the market operator intervened in the market. It was an unprecedented intervention. Why? Due to the very risk the minister had assured the people was not there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six months have gone by and we've had everyone, including the ACCC and AEMO, pointing to a root cause of both the price spikes and system risks being a lack of supply in the market, particularly a lack of supply of gas. In response, what is the government done? First, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy maligned the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism calling it 'as blunt as a basketball', and then watched as the Minister for Resources botched a deal with gas companies while trying to leverage that very mechanism that her other minister had just undermined. Then the government rejected gas from the proposed capacity mechanism, ripping over $50 million from the federal government for gas exploration and another $50 million for gas pipelines. It continues to discourage carbon capture and storage and wants the Kurri Kurri plant converted from gas as soon as possible. Its budget did, however, allocate nearly $10 million to the Environmental Defenders Office, which makes vexatious legal claims against gas projects. Amidst an energy crisis, when the opposition, along with the industry experts, have consistently been calling for more supply, the government has taken action to restrict supply and discourage the unlocking of further gas developments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the federal cabinet of government has been divided on how to address the energy crisis. Ministers blame everyone—from gas companies to the manufacturers to Vladimir Putin, of course; indeed, they're still blaming the opposition—as they float every thought bubble that comes to mind, from new taxes to price caps to export levies and any other idea that a minister thinks of. What they have failed to do to date is to speak about, let alone address, the key to the problem, which is to supply more gas into the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Issues of reliability will only worsen over time under this government's settings. Set against a backdrop of increasing demand over coming years due to population growth and electrification, we have approximately 20 gigawatts of coal-fired generator capacity due to close by 2035. That's around 80 per cent of baseload capacity in the National Electricity Market gone. Here's the issue: this baseload capacity is being removed without any guarantee of adequate replacements being up and running in time. To make matters worse, Australia's not mothballing these plants but demolishing them, leaving us with no plan B for when the government's rollout of 82 per cent renewables fails. What has the government said about this? How is it acting on these premature closures? It has said nothing and it has taken no action, only escalating the risk for the reliability of the Australian grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we received from the government over its first six months in office when it comes to delivering outcomes? Lower prices? Fail. More jobs? Fail. Investment in renewables? Fail. Improved reliability? Fail. As for delivery against its emissions reduction targets—well, only time will tell. It should be noted that this critique is based not on performance measures the coalition has established but on the government's own stated benchmarks and promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have, of course, been activities the government has pursued that it never promised the Australian people; in fact, that it never told them about. At COP27, for example, the government signed up to a global methane pledge, despite telling the Australian people, in the last term of government and during the election campaign, that it opposed signing such a pledge. Australia's livestock industry will be adversely affected by international commitments such as this, yet the government has done no modelling on this impact. Its actions demonstrate a complete disregard for that sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also at COP27, the government committed Australia to a loss and damage fund without having done any background modelling on the impact for Australia. Media reports—which I must use as a source, Mr Deputy Speaker, because this government has not provided any details—are saying the loss and damage fund will require US$2 trillion a year by 2030. Yet we do not know how much the Australian taxpayer will be asked to contribute, and the government cannot guarantee to whom such contributions would go. They cannot guarantee that Australian taxpayers' money would not go to countries such as China, the world's second-largest economy and the world's biggest emitter, yet the government have signed up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving forward from here over the next 12 months in opposition, the coalition will remain constructive where we can but critical where we must. As I mentioned at the start of this statement, there is a shared aspiration in this parliament of creating a better world and a healthier and more sustainable environment. Much of the debate about climate change and energy in Australia centres around the target of reaching net zero by 2050. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we reflect on that target, we need to ask: what sort of world—indeed, what sort of Australia—do we want to see by 2050, mid-century? As a dad to a four-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, I think of them when I reflect on that question. When they're my age, I want them to be living in an even better world than what we have today and a cleaner world, and that is because our generation would have taken the action to meet the challenges of climate change. I also want them to live in a 2050 Australia that's still a successful, independent, liberal democracy, that provides safety and security for its citizens—each enjoying the freedom and opportunity to pursue their own course in life and with their own Australian way of life protected. Is this doable? Absolutely, it is, but it won't just happen. Part of the formula is having a clearly defined pathway to decarbonise the Australian economy—one that is ambitious, optimistic and aspirational, but also practical and achievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A pathway that decarbonises the economy should be built on a platform to achieve three objectives: (1) that Australia remains prosperous, not poor; (2) that Australia be strong, not weak; and (3) that Australia be free and sovereign, and not captive to the interests of foreign powers. What have these broader objectives got to do with climate change and energy? Everything. As a nation we have committed to reaching the destination of net zero by 2050, but how we get there is the most fundamental question that needs to be answered. And that is the difference between the government and the opposition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  It's a great honour to stand in this place and speak in the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's opening speech. In May, I was very proudly elected to this place for the sixth time. Last Thursday was the 15th anniversary of my election to the Australian parliament, and I recognise some of my fellow class of 2007 as they leave the chamber. It's a position that I never take for granted. It's a great honour and a great privilege to serve the people of the Parkes electorate in the Australian parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go any further I'd like to acknowledge the people who have helped me get there and stay there. The Parkes Electorate Council and the members of the National Party in the Parkes electorate are one of the strongest political organisations in Australia. They're not activists; they are just good, solid citizens who have an interest in the running of the country, and they step up when needed. Chairman of the Parkes federal electorate council Brendan Moylan has shown great leadership, as have all of the members of that committee. I'd like to pay special tribute to my friend Peter Bartley who ran my campaign—he's run five of my six campaigns, and actually delayed his retirement to Newcastle so he could stay in Dubbo to do that. I'm very grateful to Peter for that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, unfortunately, I think there were issues that ultimately got some of the people elected to this place that I took deep offence to. There's a selection of new members here who claimed that the parliament was a corrupt place and that their election was going to actually fix that corruption and shine light on the Australian parliament. That is deeply offensive to everyone that's ever stood in this parliament, from either side. I have great respect for my colleagues in this place. In my 15 years, I have to say, corruption that's supposed to be endemic in this place is largely invisible—it's not even there. There have been a couple of members in my time who have done the wrong thing and fallen foul of the legal system, and they have been treated appropriately by the legal system. To become a member of parliament and say that your reason for being here is that somehow you are superior in a moral way to the rest of us is offensive—and I want to put that on the record. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the people of the Parkes electorate for once again showing their support for me. I believe I might've been the only conservative member in New South Wales that actually got a swing to me in the last election, and I'm very grateful for that. At the moment, when there's a lot of talk about the Voice to Parliament and the Indigenous community, I can proudly say that I won the booth at Wilcannia, so I beat the Indigenous-Aboriginal Party candidate in their home town. I got a 17 per cent swing to me in Brewarrina. I won the booths at Bourke, Walgett and Coonamble. I got a nine per cent swing to me in South Broken Hill—didn't quite win a booth in Broken Hill, but I'm getting closer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I can speak with some authority on the issues concerning Indigenous Australians as their representative for such a long time and as someone who has support from those people. That responsibility is an important thing for me because this job is not about what is easy. It's not about being seen to express your superiority on morality or anything else. This job is about doing what you think is the right thing to do, and that's not always what might seem to be the most popular thing. I take this debate very seriously and I'm considering issues very closely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank all the people right across my electorate who handed out and helped me during the election process. I want to make particular comments about my friends from the subcontinent. In Dubbo and other towns a lot of the people that handed out for me on election day were from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. They're new settlers in the Parkes electorate who are making an enormous contribution. I'm very proud that 20 per cent of the population of Dubbo was born overseas. We are becoming a real multicultural community, but I think we have a bit more to do in that space. Speaking to Minister Giles about it, we will probably need more services for new migrants as more and more of them are choosing to come to regional Australia, rather than to the capital cities where a lot of those services are. There is a need for more migrant services, particularly for the partners. Quite often a couple will come and one of the partners will have a job. The other one can be a bit isolated because they're in a strange country with a different culture. If there's no a network of people to help them, it can be isolating. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm proud of the previous government, as someone who was part of it. I recognise my good friend and a former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack is in the chamber now. We did a lot of good things. A lot of those are evident in the Parkes electorate. As a former minister for infrastructure, we got the Inland Rail started. That's the massive infrastructure project that's going to link not only Brisbane and Melbourne; for the first time there'll be a standard gauge railway line that links every capital city in Australia. It'll be a more efficient transport service so that the primary producers and miners in my electorate can get their product to port in a more efficient and cheaper way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday, the first grain train on the newly completed section from Moree to Narrabri carried grain along the Inland Rail down onto the Hunter line to the Port of Newcastle. In the recent flooding, despite the anxiety and criticism about Inland Rail and the talk of the impact of water, guess what? The only thing that was above water in the last flood between Moree to Narrabri was the Inland Rail. Its design did what it was supposed to do. The water flowed as it was supposed to. It did its job. So, when it's completed, we'll have a flood-free rail connection between Melbourne and Brisbane. The member for Riverina knows the issues we have on the Newell Highway with flooding in a wet season like this. This is going to have enormous benefits. I think a truck goes up the Newell Highway through Dubbo now about every 70 seconds, and that freight task is increasing. So the Inland Rail will help alleviate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local communities are on board. I pay tribute to the New South Wales government. They have funded a special activation precinct in Moree, and we are starting to see real interest in investment that is going to have a long-term benefit for future generations in the north-west. Narrabri, with the work that the New South Wales government is doing, on top of what the previous government contributed, has developed an inland port with connection to gas from the Narrabri gas field, with all sorts of food manufacturing, fertiliser manufacturing and recycling of plastics. Narrabri already has a large recycling industry, but to have that access to rail will be good because one of the factors in recycling is the huge transport costs for the bulky recyclables. So to have the rail connected to an industrial park and connected to a gas field is really going to underpin the economy of that area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is health. I was privileged to have the role of regional health minister for a period of time in the last government. Last week, the University of Sydney officially opened up the brand-new medical school in Dubbo. The first cohort of students have just about completed their first year, and I am told that they are performing absolutely at the top level. It's not a reduced course. It's not dumbed down for country people. It is exactly the same course that you would do if you were in Sydney. These students are performing above average. Five-hundred prospective students applied for the 24 positions at the medical school. These people include Emily from Quambone, a young chap from Coonabarabran and another person from Forbes. Local people doing medicine in their local area will be a huge benefit</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dubbo has now become a real health precinct. There was a contribution from the New South Wales government, but I'm particularly proud of my involvement, and the federal government's involvement, in the Western Cancer Centre. This facility is state of the art—as good as the best cancer centres anywhere in Australia. Their three-year plan for where they would be was achieved in three months. We are saving lives close to home. Particularly with my western towns, particularly with some of the Aboriginal folk and others who have never left their hometowns, going to Sydney for cancer treatment is a bridge too far. Quite sadly, people were choosing death over having treatment. Now, we have treatment in Dubbo at that cancer centre, and the fact that technicians, specialists and doctors have come from all over Australia to work in this centre is simply amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Macquarie Home Stay is providing accommodation for people coming in to have the cancer treatment, or people like young mums coming in from the west. The members here might be surprised to know that, if you're a young mum in Bourke, you live four hours from the birthing unit. They're encouraged to come into Dubbo in time, so that they're not having to give birth on the side of the Mitchell Highway. Macquarie Home Stay has provided a wonderful opportunity. But sadly, in September, they turned away 160 people, because they don't have the accommodation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put in an application under the Building Better Regions Fund—it wasn't a large amount: $2.8 million—to build a number of rooms. Sadly, that program was discontinued, and we're back to scratch. The CEO of Macquarie Home Stay was in the building this morning, speaking to ministers and trying to get this now on the agenda of the new government, because it is an essential facility, providing services to people who are most in need. Incidentally, I was involved in a bike ride back in 2013 that raised the first $170,000 for that facility. We did 1,188 kilometres in six days. That garnered the support of the entire west of the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, as we speak, a large part of my electorate is impacted by floods. Pretty well everyone close to the river system is. The Parkes electorate is half of NSW. It's 30 per cent of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a bit frustrating at times to hear some of the strong opinions on what's good for the residents and the communities of the Murray-Darling Basin from people who've actually never been there—or who've maybe flown over it on their way to their annual trip overseas. At the moment, Mother Nature is showing who's in charge. In the drought, when it doesn't rain, the system dries. It's an ephemeral system. My part of the Murray-Darling Basin is an ephemeral system. So we've gone from rivers you could ride a pushbike down to that same river now being five kilometres wide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Condobolin last Friday, and that Lachlan system—as the member for Riverina well knows—has been in flood for a long time. The road between Condobolin and Forbes has been shut for six months. While the towns have largely managed, the rural sector has really been impacted. Moree Plains Shire Council alone estimates 120,000 hectares of winter crop washed away in this flood. That's billions of dollars across my electorate of potential income right on the eve of harvest, which is really difficult to deal with. The farmers, following on from a couple of good years, will get through this. But the common theme, when I had Minister Watt with me in Moree a few weeks ago, is that we'll manage this part of it, but what we need help with is the infrastructure. I've still got farmers in several places who have got last year's crop on their farm because the roads have been that bad—some of them underwater, obviously—that they haven't been able to get that grain to market. I've met with Minister Catherine King, and I think there's an opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say, I think the system for the flood and disaster funding is working well. I'll pay tribute to Minister Watt; I think he's been very proactive in this space, working with the state governments and local mayors. That part of it I think is working as it should. But the constant wet weather has deteriorated the road network. In some cases they're nearly impassable. So I think there's a strong argument for funding on top of the regular funding that comes through with the FA grants or Roads to Recovery. My suggestion would be another round of funding through Roads to Recovery because the formula is there. The former minister, the member for Riverina, was able to use that mechanism during the drought to put more money into local areas. That mechanism could be used to put more money into those councils that are badly impacted by the wet weather for those roads that are becoming very, very difficult to use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the vagaries of the weather, the Parkes electorate is in a very solid position. Prior to the pandemic, unemployment in Dubbo was about 2.1 per cent. Right across the Parkes electorate and in all of those western towns, unemployment is below the national average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The single biggest issue that we have at the moment is lack of people. Obviously, for emotional reasons, there's a lot of discussion now around the medical workforce—doctors, allied health workers, nurses and workers in aged care. We have a massive need there. This is an issue right through, from the legal profession to all the trades or any job that you want to undertake. There has been a lot of discussion. I heard Minister Clare yesterday speaking about the number of people needing to be encouraged to go into teaching. All of those things are manifesting themselves at the moment, and it's a real challenge. We've also got housing shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got huge potential in the west. In Broken Hill alone, there are cobalt and magnetite proposals. Magnetite is the raw material for making greener, cleaner steel, and cobalt is important for batteries and other electronics. We've got a lithium proposal for the village of Fifield, a massive rare earths proposal for Dubbo and huge gold reserves that have been uncovered between Tomingley and Peak Hill. These are mining proposals that the country is screaming out for as they look for a cleaner, greener future. Those raw materials are in the Parkes electorate. But we're going to have to work very, very hard to make sure that we have not only the miners and technicians to come in there but the people to service them—the mechanics, hospitality workers and others right across the board. Western New South Wales and the Parkes electorate are looking at a very, very bright future if we can overcome some of those difficulties we're facing at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even regarding tourism, Broken Hill has now become such a destination, and you can add the film industry to that. Not many people look at the Parkes electorate and think of the film industry, but we had one of the Hemsworths doing his morning jogs around Broken Hill for a few weeks while they were filming the last <span style="font-style:italic;">Mad Max</span> movie. Eight-hundred people came into town just for that alone. The Mundi Mundi Bash music festival saw 16,000 people out at Silverton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is diversity in culture, from the arts and movie making to agriculture, mining and education. The potential is there. It's a great privilege to represent such a dynamic part of Australia. Every day I'm grateful for the opportunity to do that. I thank the Governor-General for his opening speech, and I look forward to working in this place for the next term of government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  At this point of the year, we're now well into the work of building a better future across the nation and, importantly for me, across the communities of my electorate of McEwen. In May this year I was given the great honour of being returned by the people of McEwen to this place. As I have before, I pledge to them that I will work day and night to fulfil our commitments to them and do all that is within the powers of this government to make their lives better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May 2022 the Australian people voted for change. They voted for a government to deliver on change. Labor's plan is clear, and our mandate to deliver is just as clear. We committed to tackling the cost-of-living crisis facing Australia, to get wages moving again, to make child care cheaper, to act on climate change and to seize opportunities to become a renewable energy superpower. We said that we would invest in the skills, the training, the apprenticeships and the technology that our economy needs to thrive; that we would help more Australians know the security of a roof over their heads; that we would embrace the Uluru Statement from the Heart; that we would rehabilitate Australia's reputation in the region and around the world; and that we would bring dignity and humanity back to aged care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is up to my colleagues and me on this side of the chamber to take those plans and put them into action. As I said, this is a government that has been delivering on those commitments. It's a heavy responsibility that we have, but it's one that the Albanese Labor government is both capable of and committed to. You only have to look at the Treasurer's first budget to know that this work is already well underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like every election, the last one was a tough fight. We saw a dying government flailing and desperately trying to cling to power every day. They had to parachute candidates, trying to present a fresher voice for an old and tired government. They looked past the serious economic situation we now face and shovelled money out the door in the hope that people would forget the decade of neglect that faced my community. But the people of McEwen saw through that. They knew they could not trust the Liberal Party or their dodgy candidates, and they put their faith in Labor to deliver real and effective change in their lives. This fact was even noticed by the Liberal candidate, who went out and said the government had deliberately neglected our area for nine years—great tick for them over there!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, during this election, we made a number of important local infrastructure commitments in McEwen. As everyone in McEwen knows, good, safe and well-planned roads are critical for our local economy. We are the people who drive, and we need to do that safely. So we announced $150 million in Labor's first budget for the construction of a Hume Freeway interchange at Camerons Lane. This is an essential project for the Mitchell and Whittlesea councils. It is estimated this project will create 20,000 jobs in the regions and pave the way for more than 30,000 homes to be built. What is important is that, in the last sitting week, the member for Aston came in here and complained about us doing that, despite the fact that they ended up matching that commitment. What a bizarre world we sit in now, where there is a nine-year vacuum of responsibility from those on the other side!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During that announcement, we also committed to working with the Victorian government to actually deliver on the previous government's announcement of $50 million to construct the diamond interchange at Watson Street on the Hume Freeway. We found out subsequently that this was part of the now disgraced car park rort scheme—money that was never going to come. In fact, they also promised $50 million to upgrade the Hume Highway and put extra lanes in there. We then found out that they'd secretly pulled that money out and taken it away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had two elections where they directly lied to the people of McEwen. Then they were going to shovel this car park rorts money into the Watson Street interchange. That was a project, which, for our community, was a top delivery, and our community was failed by two years of deliberate neglect and deliberate untruth from the former government in getting that done. But, lo and behold, we committed to it, and we were able to work directly with the Victorian government, which committed another $130 million to do the Watson Street upgrade as well as the Wallan ramp. So these projects will now get done. That's the difference between a Labor government and a coalition mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed to improve roads across Mitchell and the Macedon Ranges, with $11 million to deliver safer, better roads. I'm pleased to say that all of these projects that we've spoken about were confirmed in our first budget. We also announced funding for a range of important local community structures, including $15 million for stage 2 of the Macedon Ranges Regional Sports Precinct. This project had been waiting nine years under the coalition government to get that funding, despite the council following the government recommendations for applying for grants every time. Senator Bridget McKenzie told them to apply for these different rounds of grants. They never got a thing. We committed to it in 2019 and we backed that up again in 2022. Guess what? Now the sods are being turned and this project is going to happen. There is also the $1.5 million for a recreational splash park in Doreen, $1.5 million for upgrading the Diamond Creek Outdoor Pool and $515,000 for essential works on the Greenhill lower oval in Wallan. Again, each and every one of these projects I've spoken about has been confirmed in the first Albanese Labor government budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that we have trouble with in our area is communicating to our constituents. It's long been a problem ignored by the previous government. We had their rorted program on mobile black spots. There were three simple elements in the program: major transport hubs, rural and regional areas and areas prone to natural disaster. I live in an electorate that had 80 per cent of it burned out in the past 20 years, plus floods and storms, and 1½ towers is all they would deliver. The half tower was actually turning on one that was turned off; it wasn't actually delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But along came the Albanese Labor government, making commitments such as $1.5 million for two mobile towers, in Gisborne South and Woodend, two communities that need them. Many communities in the Macedon Ranges have poor mobile reception, and fixing these black spots is extremely important to them because places like South Gisborne have been overlooked for so long. It's been my No. 1 priority in every submission that we sent to the hapless lot over there, and they totally ignored it. The town of Woodend is undergoing some mobile works at the moment. Once they are complete, we will be able to work with the shire to eradicate the remaining black spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For nine years, the neglect from those opposite has meant businesses have closed down. They talk about how they're the great people for small business, but they could not help these businesses get simple things such as the ability to use EFTPOS. Let's think about what that means in a tourist town. People come in. They want to buy things. They want to be part of a regional community, but they can't even get their money out, because they can't get access to EFTPOS. They can't use their mobile phones if anything happens. The irony is that it's our government, the real friends of small business, that is out there helping those businesses grow. No more have left town since May. Do you know why? It is because we actually got on with the job of doing something. We're delivering the things that they need. When businesses can't get 4G, you've really got to sit down and say, 'What was the point of the LNP government?' They couldn't help small businesses, they couldn't help communities in an emergency and they certainly didn't give a toss about country areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election, we made a number of critical commitments to schools in the electorate of McEwen, and I'm certainly looking forward to seeing Minister Clare to remind him of these and to say, 'These need to happen.' There is $50,000 for a new playground for the year ones at Hazel Glen College in Mernda, providing a safe fun space for children as part of the learning development. There is $50,000 for a new outdoor learning space for Diamond Creek East Primary School and $7,600 for Gisborne Secondary College for new shade sails. I am confident that this government will deliver that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GPs were another issue we had, and I want to end this lie that has been put forward by the rump over there about us taking doctors out of regional areas to put into suburbs. It is an absolute lie. When members over on that side call places like Kyneton, Woodend, Mount Macedon 'city areas', you know they are absolutely clueless about Victoria—particularly members who sit there and say, 'You're putting doctors into local areas at our expense.' No, we are reversing what you did in 2019 when you cut the availability of doctors in regional areas to attract more doctors, cutting the funding and the MMA rating, leading to the district workforce shortage. We ran a full campaign before the election to get that done, and we got it done, so now doctors' practices which are overworked in regional areas can attract new doctors. It was a deliberate decision by the Nationals and the Liberals to cut that DPA status to try to load their own electorates up at the expense of the fastest-growing areas in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a continual problem that we've had. Pork-barrelling was done under the previous government at the expense of areas. As I said earlier, their own hapless Liberal candidate admitted that that government, the Morrison-Abbott-Turnbull mess, was deliberately not funding our communities, because they wanted a Labor seat. We know why it's a Labor seat: they know that, when they elect Labor members, they get what they've asked for. They get the delivery of the goods. They get the service. They get their help. When they get the Liberals or the LNP—the 'lying narcissist party'—they get nothing, and this has been a real problem.</span>

Their policies are sometimes good on paper, but the devil is in the detail and in how it affects those who don't wake up to a Sydney or Melbourne skyline, like the people of the small Wimmera town of Dimboola. In Dimboola, there is a community-owned aged-care facility called the Allambi Elderly Peoples Home. Allambi has 12 self-contained units for people who can live independently and 14 beds in a separate facility for those with higher-acuity needs—but not for long. In a prime example of bureaucratic tick and flick, Allambi's higher-care facility is being shut because it does not meet Labor's one-size-fits-all policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Generations of the town's residents have been looked after at Allambi since it opened in 1960, following a community meeting. Residents will now need to uproot their lives and find new accommodation. Where is the dignity in that for people who are in the twilight years of their lives? The Prime Minister's catchcry was that no-one would be left behind under his government. I stand here speaking for the residents of Dimboola, for those in Allambi and for those who have family and friends in that centre; they are being left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Jess is a 27-year-old teacher who lives in a small apartment in Prahran. She has met every expectation one could hope for. She got a skill; she pays her taxes; she even coaches the local netball team on weekends. Along with 35 per cent of my constituents, Jess is a renter, but she'd love to have her own place. She wants the same social mobility that her parents enjoyed, and who can blame her? But, these days, a teacher's wage is scarcely enough to pay the rent, let alone secure a deposit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Higgins, the median rent sits at $420 a week. Over 27 per cent of renters experience rental stress, losing more than 30 per cent of their income to rent. With a median property price of $1.7 million in Prahran, $2.1 million in South Yarra, $1.6 million in Windsor, $1.6 million in Murrumbeena and $1.7 million in Carnegie, stumping up a deposit has never been harder. For the 71,000 people below the age of 34 in Higgins, the prospect of homeownership has become like chasing a mirage in the desert. There are many Jesses who want a better life.</span>

They inspire and they're very thought-provoking. They help those of us who haven't experienced living with a disability understand what the trials and tribulations are like.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Season 4 features the stories of six people living with a disability who are carving out careers for themselves and who are engaged in meaningful employment, be it entrepreneurial or in the workplace. The films are produced by a fantastic team of producers and filmmakers of all abilities. I was honoured to be part of their premiere screening and was inspired by these men and women who have worked through great adversity to grow their careers. Their bold aspirations and the fulfilment they find in their work was a great source of encouragement to me.</span>

People of all abilities play an integral role in our workforce. I would like to pay tribute to those living with a disability who are overcoming great challenges to participate in the workforce each and every day. Well done.</span>

The red-tailed black-cockatoo holds a very special place in my heart, and I was immediately drawn to Jasmine's entry, among the more than 50 entries received. The theme this year was Australian flora and fauna. Jasmine doesn't yet know that she is the winner of this competition, and I don't think she's tuning in, this early on Thursday morning back in Western Australia. I do look forward to seeing Jasmine, though, and congratulating her in person.</span>

It was difficult to choose only a handful of winners from so many high-quality entries. It's fair to say that there is no lack of creativity and talent amongst the primary school students in Hasluck. I'm very proud of the first winning entry for this year's competition.</span>

North Sydney is blessed with a number of incredible local charities, powered by volunteers who work tirelessly to enrich our community and support those in need. This festive season, then, my social media channels will showcase a charity Advent calendar from today until Christmas. I encourage everyone watching to consider supporting the organisations you will see, should you have the means to do so, so that we can support those who may be doing it tough at this time of year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will highlight just three such charities. Firstly, there is Mary's House Services, which provide a safe refuge and wraparound services for women and children. Their services are symbolic of our community's commitment to saying no to domestic and family violence. Secondly, we are very lucky to have a number of generous Rotary branches, including North Sydney, Lane Cove and the Chatswood Roseville branch. Rotary volunteers make a meaningful contribution with projects like removing graffiti, a seniors Christmas celebration and a street-side medics project. Thirdly, Phoenix House based in Crows Nest delivers life-changing outcomes for more than 500 of the most challenged young people in North Sydney, helping them unlock their potential and transform their lives.</span>

Students have studied at the Werribee campus for generations. For generations, we've been involved in the training of Victoria's vets. But, even after a visit to the site to see the recent upgrades this year, I'm really sad to say that the University of Melbourne is delivering us a Christmas slap. They have announced a merger that will see the privatisation of the vet hospital that they now call U-Vet. This puts at risk the local delivery service for our pets—and you can imagine how many pets there are in a population of 300,000 young families. More importantly, there are 83 locals who work at that U-Vet hospital who are now trying to figure out what their future looks like.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Melbourne university today to think deeply about the decisions they are making, to stop looking at the ledger, to remember the relationship they have with our community and to negotiate in good faith with the 83 people, mostly locals, who are employed in this part of the university and ensure that they honour redundancies—but, more importantly, ensure that those 83 individuals know what their future looks like and have good negotiations with the University of Melbourne.</span>

I want to paint the picture of what a person who has been issued one of these visas under the previous government is experiencing. They experience trauma, having fled prosecution. They experience grief, having been separated from their loved ones. They experience a loss of their home country and their culture. After fighting to get to safety, they face no better in Australia. </span>

It is inhuman, unjust and not right. We must do more to help people. Our humanity demands it. I have spoken with our Prime Minister and am proud that an Albanese Labor government is working to ease their suffering. </span>

Mick passed away after a short illness on 10 November this year. Like so many Boothby residents, Mick migrated from England in the 1970s and settled in the Marion area with his wife, Carole, and their three children. But it was Mick's long-term involvement in junior soccer in South Australia that endeared him to so many people in Boothby. </span>

From there grew his involvement with the Southern Districts Junior Soccer Association. The Southern Districts Junior Soccer Association organise soccer competitions for young people, attending over 50 primary schools in the southern metropolitan areas of Adelaide. Mick joined the committee organising the association in 1979, and he stayed. He was elected chairman and eventually changed to president in 1998, and he held that role until his passing this year.</span>

I particular want to highlight the colourful event that was hosted at Ku-ring-gai Town Hall in Pymble. The Diwali celebration was hosted by the Deputy Mayor of Ku-ring-gai, Barbara Ward, and sponsored by SHARE. They were joined by the Consul General of India, Mr Manish Gupta, alongside my state colleague Alister Henskens MP and local Hornsby Mayor, Philip Ruddock.</span>

There is a strong feeling of community pride and confidence in the room as if the previously under-recognised community of Australians of Indian backgrounds in Bradfield was at last getting the recognition that it deserves. There was a full house for the celebrations and reportedly a waiting list of nearly a hundred people who were not able to attend due to the venue having reached capacity limit.</span>

I'd like to thank Tina Brown and her team at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span> for covering this event. Local journalism is, of course, a very important means by which our community stays connected, and their coverage added to the understanding across Bradfield of the importance of our Indian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  A recent article about fossil fuel industry tax avoidance and tax integrity by James Guthrie and Adam Lucas is very telling. It stated that between 2005 and 2020 Australian coal export revenues totalled more than $643 billion. Over the same period gas exports generated $287 billion and petroleum exports more than $166 billion. In 2021-22 Australia's resources and energy export earnings surged to a record high of $425 billion and will be significantly higher next year due to current record prices for coal, oil and gas. Seventy-three of the 134 fossil fuel companies identified by the ATO in the financial year 2020-21 paid no income tax despite a total income of $164 billion in Australia. Between 2013 and 2021, 25 companies disclosed revenue of about $1,425 billion and paid an average of less than one per cent income tax on that revenue. Nine of those companies paid zero income tax over that period. By my calculations, those nine companies had collected revenue of $308 billion. It is clear from those figures that Australia's fossil fuel sector is engaged in tax avoidance and profiteering whilst Australian people struggle with higher energy prices. Public patience is wearing thin, and calls for government intervention are growing louder.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise today to speak about the horrific details I've been informed about regarding child abuse. The International Justice Mission informed me that the online sexual exploitation of children is, sadly, one of the fastest-growing crimes in world. It includes creating—how sick is that?—distributing and possessing child sexual exploitation material, like photos and videos. Alarmingly, I was informed that the abuse is actually live streamed right across the world by traffickers. Sadly, Australia is one of those markets. For as little as $19, people—sick individuals—can watch children abused online, and it's live streamed on platforms such as Facebook, Skype, Google, Yahoo, WhatsApp and Instagram. These multibillion dollar companies can simply stop this, but they refuse to do it. The sad thing is that when it comes to children being abused—in the Philippines, in particular—it can be a trusted adult selling this material online. I call on the Albanese Labor government to step in and do something about this. I'm not being critical of them at the moment, but we need to work as a parliament to address this issue, the same way we addressed this issue when it came to the awful terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.</span>

The Asbestos Diseases Research Institute is the only standalone, dedicated medical research institute which focuses on asbestos and dust related diseases in Australia. Opened in 2009, with the support of Labor state and federal governments, it was founded to address the serious public health consequences for people with asbestos related diseases—diseases which are still all too prevalent today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Located in Concord hospital in the aptly named Bernie Banton Centre, the institute has led the way with innovations across the preclinical, clinical and public health spaces. From diagnosing mesothelioma to developing early diagnosis techniques, this organisation is at the cutting edge of researching these appalling diseases. And their research and expertise goes beyond our borders. In collaboration with the WHO, they have launched an e-toolkit for the elimination of asbestos related diseases across developing countries, an example of great Australian research flying the flag overseas. I want to congratulate and thank all the researchers associated with this fantastic institute.</span>

In the month that he was elected in 2017, ambulances were ramped for just 6.9 hours at Peel Health Campus. Six years later, ambulances are ramped out the front of our hospital for more than 601 hours, or over 20 hours a day—a new record. It's a disaster for WA Labor. Ambulances are ramped around the clock, and nurses are underpaid and overworked. Now the Premier delays vital upgrades to the Peel Health Campus, in my electorate. Why has Labor failed so badly? Mark McGowan should be ashamed of the state of our hospitals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of the Peel region trusted Mark McGowan to fix our hospital, like he promised. They elected three Labor state members, but where are they now? David Templeman has been our local MP for 20 years. Why is he not standing up for our community? What is the point of being a state cabinet minister if you can't get the job done? Where is Robyn Clarke? She loves a good sod turning—she's even got her own shovel—but we're yet to see any action on the hospital. And where is Lisa Munday, an ex-paramedic who promised to fight for our community and yet is silent on this issue? Time and again, Labor have proved that they will always put the residents of my electorate last. Our community deserves better. Premier, do your job and deliver the upgrades for the hospital, because people are asking after six years: what has changed under WA Labor? The answer is 'nothing'.</span>

This election was hard-fought and hard-won by an amazing group of people committed to a better future for all Victorians. While we wait for the count to be completed, it's still possible Labor may come out with 'Danslide 2.0' to match the 'Danslide' of 2018. 'Danslide 2022': who would've predicted that?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to report to the House that some very strong Labor women will be taking state seats across our communities in McEwen, including Mary-Anne Thomas in Macedon, Ros Spence in Kalkallo, Vicki Ward in Eltham and Lauren Kathage in Yan Yean. Although she didn't get there, it was an amazing effort by Angela Tough in Euroa. She took on a very formidable opponent and did extremely well. These candidates faced some of the worst opponents the election had to offer. They faced hate, lies and vitriol, but they prevailed. We knew the other side chose the wrong guy and it turns out the people of Victoria agreed with us. So they once again threw their votes behind Labor, because Labor does what matters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Premier said on Saturday night, Victorians have not been divided, as some would like you to think. In fact, we've been united—united in our faith and our care for each other. But also we have seen hope triumph over hate in the greatest state in this nation. I congratulate all those who worked so hard to make this victory a reality. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Today I'd like to wish a belated but very happy 90th birthday to Peter Rae AO. Peter was born on 24 September 1932 in Launceston. He represented our state and the Liberal Party as a senator from 1967 to 1986. His Senate career was characterised by an independent spirit of inquiry. Peter then went on to serve in the Tasmanian parliament in the lower house for three years before returning to work as a respected lawyer, co-founding the law practice Rae &amp; Partners over 35 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Liberal with a commitment to our 'we believe' statement of caring for the environment, Peter is often referred to as the father of renewable energy in Tasmania. He is a former chairman of Hydro Tasmania and of the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Industry Development Board. He has played a leading role in turning Tasmania into the renewable energy powerhouse that it is today. He was a trailblazer. His commitment to sustainable environmental practices is to be commended, and it's one that many Liberals can look to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter's commitment to public service and to the Aboriginal community of Flinders Island was also recognised when he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1999. In 2005 Peter was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Tasmania. Peter has always been a great mentor to me and a great source of advice. He is the style of Liberal that Robert Menzies intended. I admire his continual involvement in the party and the way that he stands up for our values. Happy belated birthday, Peter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has taken the full three years since for most of the RFS firefighters who spent months fighting the Gospers Mountain fire, volunteering on the North Coast or heading down south to receive their National Emergency Medal. It has been a huge job for the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury RFS headquarters. In the Hawkesbury around 640 RFS members were awarded the medal and in the Blue Mountains a staggering 840 medals were awarded. It gives you a sense of just how vital those volunteers are. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each division chose to hand them out to members in their own way. In the Blue Mountains I was able to be at several AGMs earlier in the year, where the beautiful green-and-gold wattle emblem was presented. For the Hawkesbury there have been a succession of large medal events, including in the last few weeks, where brigades came together to recognise and remember that time.</span>

This is a terrific initiative raising awareness of the challenges of preterm birth. I'd like to highlight an exceptional member of the Upper Lachlan community in my electorate who, on 17 November, ran 110 kilometres to raise funds for the Australian charity Running for Premature Babies. Stuart McWilliam ran from his farm near Laggan, between Taralga and Crookwell, all the way to Goulburn and home again. That's a 110 kilometre round trip. What a Herculean effort for a great cause.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stuart has experienced firsthand the challenges that parents and families face when confronted with the arrival of a premature child. Stuart's own son, Nix, was born at just 30 weeks and had to fight for survival. Running for Premature Babies raises funds for life-saving neonatal equipment and research, which helped save Nix's life. He is five years old now. His dad is an ongoing supporter of this wonderful cause and wants to ensure that other families are as lucky as him. Stuart ran 19 hours straight and raised over $13,000. He was backed by a wonderful community. His fundraising efforts will offer other premature babies a better chance of survival.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  I'm always blown away by the generosity of people in Macnamara. We've started the Macnamara Christmas appeal this year. We're accepting new toys, non-perishable foods, toiletries and skincare for three amazing organisations. They are: Launch Housing, who provide homeless services for people who need a safe place during this holiday period; the Salvation Army Youth Services, who look after young people who need crisis accommodation; and, finally, inTouch, a family violence specialist service that provides support to victims of domestic violence from migrant and refugee backgrounds. If you're in Macnamara and you want to give to our incredible Christmas appeal, please drop off at my office at 219 Barkly Street, St Kilda. We're very, very proud of everyone who gives during this holiday period, and we say thank you to those who are part of that Christmas appeal and happy birthday to Adele. </span>

In the budget the government had an opportunity to outline a plan to provide relief for families from the cost-of-living crisis. The government also had an opportunity to implement your promise to Australians to reduce their power prices by $275, and yet the government did nothing. If the government does have a plan to help Australians, why hasn't it been announced by now? Why, after six months, has this Prime Minister left Australian families and businesses waiting? </span>

He speaks about six months in office and, indeed, we have been in government for six months. Six months ago what we inherited was the largest deficit since the Second World War and $1 trillion of debt with little to show for it. We inherited sluggish economic growth and an economy that was not growing like it used to. We inherited productivity going backwards. We inherited declining business investment, and we inherited widespread skills shortages which were holding businesses back. We inherited flatlining wages—many Australians hadn't received a decent pay rise in almost a decade, in spite of working longer hours and working harder—and more Australians in insecure work than ever before. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We framed a budget by the Treasurer of Australia doing the hard work through the ERC process to make sure that we framed a budget that did not put further pressure on inflation. Because of what is happening globally, we were responsible, and that's why we put 99 per cent over two years of the revenue gains that had been made, in part because of the inflated prices of our resources, straight into the bottom line. But we made room as well to assist with the cost-of-living pressures. We made room to deliver on our childcare commitments, the largest on-budget commitment that we've made that will help more than a million Australian families. We made room to have the first decrease in the cost of medicines since a former Labor government introduced the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—from $42.50 down to $30. We made room to create 180,000 fee-free TAFE places to provide support for people wanting to get better education and training.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, as well, we took action in our first six months to increase the inputs that are called wages—something that those opposite had a deliberate strategy of keeping low over their decade in office. We put forward a proposition, as one of our first acts, for people on the minimum wage not to go backwards, and, indeed, the Fair Work Commission listened. That 5.2 per cent increase—that dollar coin that I held up day after day during the election campaign—that was going to wreck the economy, that was reckless according to those opposite, well, it wasn't reckless; it was responsible.</span>

                  </a>  It is a great honour to have Professor Sean Turnell here in the chamber today with his magnificent wife, Dr Ha Vu. I most enjoyed our discussion prior to question time, when I welcomed him into my office. I had the pleasure of speaking with Sean when we both touched down in Bangkok just a couple of weeks ago—indeed, less than a couple of weeks ago. As we entered the chamber here, Sean said to me that two weeks ago he was there in the prison, incarcerated by a regime that has trashed human rights in Myanmar and that incarcerated Professor Turnell, who was there in Myanmar giving advice to Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader of Myanmar, on how their economy could be improved. What he endured in his 650 days of incarceration is something that no human being should have to endure, yet he has done it with grace and, even in inhumane conditions, with profound humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relief and joy at your release are also tinged with no small amount of awe—awe and respect at your courage, your optimism and your resilience. We are so glad, as you've seen from the response across the chamber here, to have you back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to also pay tribute to Dr Ha Vu. As Professor Turnell said in the <span style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">30</span> interview—the magnificent interview, which I would encourage everyone to watch, with Sarah Ferguson the other night—this wasn't in the marriage vows. There must have been times when you felt like you were in a prison of a different nature, but your determination, your fearless advocacy and the love that powered it all proved greater than the hate and everything that you and your beloved husband were up against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened to Professor Turnell should never have happened, but, as he has said to me in our conversations, he was so grateful for the support he received from DFAT and our consular staff. Today I want to pay tribute to those who provided those glimmers of hope with their deliveries and their advocacy. They gave him hope during dark times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the efforts of Foreign Minister Penny Wong and her team in securing his release. In particular, on behalf of Australia, a grateful nation, I thank for the exceptional assistance that we received our ASEAN partners and our other friends, including Japan, in securing Professor Turnell's release. It was a very good day. Professor Turnell struck me with his humility upon his release. It was quite extraordinary. I am so proud that he is now looking, it must be said, a fair bit healthier after what was an awful time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all, I want to thank Professor Turnell for being here today and for displaying the absolute best of the Australian spirit. I thank all those from across the political spectrum, from across our community who all campaigned so strongly and so consistently to secure the release. You are a most welcome guest, as is Dr Ha Vu.</span>

There was as much excitement up in the gallery as there was here on the floor of the chamber. I heard the Prime Minister speak yesterday, at our 34 Squadron Christmas drinks, about the story, Sean, of your request for the first meal, which I think was a pub meal—a pretty simple request facilitated by the Royal Australian Air Force and the fine work that they undertook.</span>

I want to say thank you to the Prime Minister and thank you to former prime minister Morrison. I acknowledge the work of Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong and her predecessor, Marise Payne. We spent many hours around the National Security Committee table, looking at every possible angle of how we could exert pressure, work with those neighbours and people in the region, across ASEAN—indeed, any influence from any partner across the world, covert and overt, in providing assistance to see the early release of Sean Turnell. It went on for way too long, and we were up against a very significant adversary.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, your bravery has shone through. The demeanour and the grace with which you have carried yourself, Sean, is quite remarkable given what you have gone through and the passion that you have for the cause that you are fighting for: people less fortunate than yourself. All you desired was a better future for Myanmar and for that country to advance into the world and not to regress, and that is on display in every public appearance that you have as well. As you point out, for your long-suffering wife as well, we acknowledge what you as a family have gone through: the pain, the separation, the pressure that that puts on individuals and on a relationship, the anxiety that it creates. But now, of course, the life that you can share is shared by our nation with you, and we wish you every success into the future.</span>

Let me go through the issue very clearly. The Help to Buy scheme, a shared equity scheme which I announced at the ALP election campaign in Perth, is that: a shared equity scheme. If you have 100 per cent of a mortgage by yourself, you pay 100 per cent of the interest yourself. If you have a shared equity scheme then by definition a portion of that is not paid by you. That's what a shared equity scheme is. It is completely relevant. It is the way that it works. If you don't understand it, I suggest you talk to the New South Wales Liberal government, which is implementing a scheme, or the Victorian government or the WA government—or, indeed, have a look at what the former Prime Minister Scott Morrison had to say about such schemes in the past.</span>

The member, as a mother of two young children—two very cute young children, I might add—knows very well that access to affordable early childhood education is vital not only to a child's development but also to our economy. On 21 May Australians voted for change, and we have not wasted a single day in office delivering that change. The Albanese government has certainly hit the ground running, delivering for Australian families and securing a better, brighter future for our children in just six months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would make sure that all Australian children, no matter their background, could have access to the benefits of quality early childhood education and care—and we have. We said we would ease the cost-of-living pressures on families by making early childhood education more affordable for 1.26 million Australian families—and we have. We said we would give parents more choice and boost productivity by ensuring that more primary caregivers could work more days, work more hours and take on more study—and we have. We said we would build the relationship the previous government broke with the early childhood education sector by recognising them as professionals and not just childminders—and we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment in the early years of a child's life that we have delivered through the bill that passed last week to make early childhood education and care more affordable secures a bright future for all Australian children. The evidence tells us that children who participate in a high-quality early learning programs have better educational outcomes, better health outcomes, improved literacy and numeracy skills, greater school retention, and higher graduation levels. Indeed, those benefits follow a child through school and well into their adulthood. That investment it is also important for our economy because it means that more primary caregivers can go to work and add to the household budget if they so wish. It gives women and families more choice and more opportunity to increase their household income. After a decade of waste—and a wasted decade—the Albanese government is delivering for Australians, just like we said we would.</span>

They know, as the science says, that we need to phase out coal and gas mining to save their homelands from the climate crisis. You've said that it's up to the market, but this week the market said it's planning for 12 coalmines in Queensland past 2050, with two still operating in 2099. Do you still say that the future of coal and gas should be left to the market?</span>

It is true that the international market will dictate what coal is sold from this country—equally, what gas is sold from this country and, equally, what iron ore is sold from this country—as it does for higher education exports and for all the things we export. Commodities, of course, support this economy and have done for many years—coal, indeed, since 1801.</span>

We want to make sure that all of the high-emitting industries in this nation reduce their emissions so that we can reach net zero emissions by 2050. The truth is that other nations chose to reach net zero emissions well before this country did. Japan and Korea were both ahead of this country in making that pledge. These countries continue to purchase our coal, gas and iron ore. Two of those things make the all-important steel, which will be required for infrastructure right around the world, including in building the new capital of Indonesia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  Thanks to the member for Holt for another important question. She is a warrior for working Australians and for the vulnerable in her community, and, once again, she is asking about an important matter. The government changed hands just over six months ago at a time of slowing global growth and a war in Europe that was causing havoc in energy markets, feeding high and rising inflation and rising interest rates around the world. Since then, these global challenges have intensified, putting more pressure on Australia, on our economy and on Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a bad government hit the fence in May, it was replaced by a new government prepared to take these big economic challenges seriously—to talk up to people, not talk down to them; not spray money around and make inflation worse; not sit on our hands while the skills crisis intensified; not pursue a policy of deliberate wage stagnation; not ignore the big challenges in energy, aged care and the budget. These were the defining features and the defining failures of a decade of economic mismanagement. They made us more vulnerable to the sorts of international shocks we're seeing in the global economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past six months have been about cleaning up the mess left to us, making the budget more responsible, making our economy more resilient and delivering for Australians. We said we'd deliver cheaper child care, and we delivered. We said we would deliver cheaper medicines, and we delivered. We said we'd deliver fee-free TAFE, and we delivered. We said we would give young people more chances to get a degree, and we are delivering that as well. We said we would tackle Australia's housing affordability challenges, and we are delivering. We said we would invest in cheaper and cleaner energy, and we are doing that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would recognise the vast economic opportunities of a better national broadband network, and we are delivering that as well. We said we would fix the aged-care crisis, and we are. We said we would bring manufacturing back with the National Reconstruction Fund, and we are. We said we would get wages moving again, and that's exactly what we are delivering by backing an increase to the minimum wage and award wages—done; by backing a wage increase for aged-care workers and paying for it—done, and getting it done; and by fixing a broken bargaining system, which we are delivering as well. We said we would do these things, and we are, because we told the Australian people we would put them front and centre again, we would take their pressures seriously and we would build a better future together, and that is exactly what we are delivering. </span>

Before the last election, you promised Australians 97 times that you would lower their energy bills by $275. Since then, you have been asked 26 times in this place whether you stand by that commitment and, on each occasion, you have refused to answer. Why have you broken this solemn promise made to Australian households and businesses?</span>

We said that we'd act to get wages moving and we have delivered. We said that we would act on the annual wage review. Those opposite said the sky would fall in. Workers, as a result of the award system around the country, are now being paid more as a result of the action that the government took.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said that we would act on the aged-care review. Those opposite, when they were in government, said the government shouldn't even make a submission saying that aged-care workers deserve a pay rise. This government said that we should. We did, and we've had the first part of the decision from the commission backing a wage increase for people who work in the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've also argued that you need to change the law to get wages moving. Those opposite delayed for 10 years while they deliberately tried to keep wages low. In the Senate right now they are continuing to try to delay getting wages moving with the secure jobs, better pay bill. There are 19 amendments to be debated in the Senate—19 amendments that have been put forward. In nine hours of debate, because of the behaviour of, principally, Senator Cash, how many amendments do you think the Senate's got through?</span>

                  </a>  Zero! In nine hours! So you might want to do the maths on how likely they are to delay this, how long they'll try to keep this going. In nine hours of debate, those opposite are doing everything they can—as if 10 years of delay wasn't enough—to delay every extra minute, every extra hour they possibly can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, this government's view is that 10 years of delay is long enough. People should not have to wait longer for gender equality to be an objective of the Fair Work Act. People should not have to wait longer for the sunsetting of agreements that have been in place since the Work Choices era. People should not have to wait longer for a bargaining system that works and gets wages moving. People should not have to wait longer for the banning of pay secrecy clauses. People should not have to wait longer for it to be illegal to advertise a job for less than the legal minimum wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite dedicated 10 years to keeping wages deliberately low. Once secure jobs, better pay goes through, we will have getting wages moving as a deliberate design feature of this government.</span>

I think all ministers would expect a question on something that was on the front page of a newspaper—so no surprises there.

The document the honourable member refers to does refer to the closure of Liddell power station and Bayswater power station. Liddell's closure was announced in 2015, and Bayswater's closure was announced in February this year. A common fact about those closures is that we weren't in office at the time. A common fact about that is that those opposite were in charge at the time those were announced.</span>

                  </a>  To be fair to the honourable member who asked the question, he had a plan for Liddell. He planned to nationalise the Liddell power station, if only he was in a job where he could have done something about that—if only he had a role in the government where he could have made a decision! The former Minister for Energy had a plan for Bayswater when the closure was announced. He issued a press release saying the Morrison government expects the market to step up. That was his big plan: the market to step up to deal with the closure of Bayswater. That's all he had. I guess that was better than the closure of the Eraring power station, where the minister didn't even know it was being closed until he read it in the newspaper. That was the level of trust between the New South Wales energy minister and the federal energy minister. The New South Wales energy minister—a Liberal minister—was involved in the planning of the closure. He didn't trust the federal minister enough to tell him.</span>

Since last week, I've ascertained the following: four contracts were issued to Infosys, to a total value of $274 million, to upgrade payment software in human services. It's called the ECE project. It's still going.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The timeline for ECE is as follows: 2 October 2018, ECE tender opens; three companies, including Infosys, shortlisted. 29 May 2019, member for Fadden appointed Minister for Human Services and NDIS. 26 June 2019, leaked emails reveal minister meets Infosys and his good friend David Milo, a paid consultant to Infosys, in Sydney. 2 July 2019, the final evaluation submitted, negotiations as to value and period of contract continue for another four months. 8 November 2019, Infosys is finally awarded contract for the first of four contracts valued at $18 million. 19 November 2019, minister meets Infosys. 30 December 2019, minister meets friend Milo at the Gold Coast, triggers an email from Milo saying 'minister gave insights on progress of Infosys and future opportunities'. 1 February 2020, minister is guest speaker at Infosys conference at Melbourne Park on the afternoon of the Australian Open finals. 1 July 2020, Infosys awarded a further $142 million contract. At the same time, wheels start to come off the project. It has to be overhauled, and one of the unsuccessful tenderers is called in to resuscitate the project.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of these facts and other materials from the Synergy 360 papers, I've asked agencies a range of questions, including: did the former minister ever alert the department he was meeting Synergy 360 and/or Infosys up to and after its successful bid? Were unsuccessful rival ECE bidders, IBM and Accenture, ever notified of the member for Fadden's meetings with an Infosys consultant? What, if any, were communications between the minister or other persons in his personal office and Services Australia and the department about the progress of the ECE contract pre and post Infosys being awarded the contract? Were the status reports of the ECE project provided at least monthly to Minister Robert and any of his personal staff? What if any contracts were awarded to Synergy 360 clients in areas of responsibility of Minister Roberts, including, but not limited to, Delv, Adobe, Infosys and Salesforce?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I remind members of parliament and the member for Fadden, after an unfortunate development this morning: please come through my office if you have any requests of the relevant agencies. Do not do what you did this morning, and inappropriately task and pressure public servants, who are no longer your ministerial responsibility. </span>

The member refers to events over the last 12 months. A few things have happened over the last 12 months, particularly this year when Russia invaded Ukraine. That happened. I'm sure that the former Minister for Defence is right across all the details about when and how that happened. Another thing that's happened is the impact of that. Today we see thermal coal trading at $534 a tonne, compared to $286 a tonne last December. Of course these things are going to have an impact—</span>

                  </a>  The government's approach is twofold. Firstly, in the short term, senior ministers are working very closely together to ensure the impacts of the Russian invasion do not flow through to industries and businesses without government response and protection. That's how this side of the House works it through, carefully and methodically. We also continue with our medium-term plans to ensure that the cheapest form of renewable energy becomes a greater part of our grid. Nowhere benefits more from that program than the regions of Australia, including North Queensland. The regions will power our renewable Australia. They will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and lower power prices across Australia because we believe in investing in the regions. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know the opposition has a different view. We had a ministerial statement this morning. The shadow minister responded to me, and he talked about low-cost nuclear energy. Low-cost nuclear energy was their plan. They had their seminar last week—their 'uneconomic atomic frolic'—that was promoting nuclear energy. We know that AEMO and the CSIRO say that nuclear energy from small modular reactors will cost thousands of dollars a kilowatt.</span>

But it's okay: the opposition has a plan because the member for Fairfax has announced that the CSIRO is wrong. That's their plan.

We said we'd cut the price of medicines for millions of Australians, and we've delivered. On 1 January we will deliver the largest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, putting $200 million every single year back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. In July we slashed by 25 per cent the maximum amount that pensioners and concession card holders would pay for their medicines, and in September we cut the price of more than 2,000 brands of medicines, putting $130 million back into the pockets of Australian patients.</span>

She's absolutely right on two fronts: Australia has to be a circular economy, and we've got a real issue with solar panels and batteries from the solar industry. Of course, it's fantastic that more people are putting solar on the roof. We've got about 3 million Australian households and businesses that have solar panels on the roof now. They're saving money for themselves. They are saving about 1,000 bucks a year for an average family. They've reduced emissions by close to 18 million tonnes in 2021. A fantastic achievement. About eight per cent of the energy going into our national electricity grid is coming from rooftop solar. Great, great, great!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that these systems last a couple of decades if they're going well. If we don't change what we're doing now, by 2030 there will be about a quarter of a million tonnes of this material in landfill. That's bad because the panels and the batteries contain valuable metals and minerals, and we should be re-using them. It's terrible for the environment, because we know that lithium batteries in particular, as they break apart, leach into the soil. That's not great for the soil or the environment. It's better for jobs to recycle, with about three jobs for recycling compared to one if it's going to landfill. It's better for the environment and better for the economy to recycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The solar industry has been on notice for years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is an expert in recycling: back bench, front bench, back bench, front bench! She put the solar industry on notice, but they never took any notice of her. I have said that I will regulate. We are prepared to invest. We've set aside a quarter of a billion dollars for recycling infrastructure, including $60 million for soft plastics. I spoke to the supermarket giants just today about soft plastics and fixing the mess of REDcycle. We are prepared to invest and we are prepared to regulate. Those opposite weren't prepared to regulate.</span>

Over the last six months I think everyone on this side of the House has been struck by just how consequential the moment is in which we have come to office; how precarious and how complex Australia's strategic circumstances are, and how the lost decade that Australia experienced under the former coalition government could not have come at a worse time.</span>

Over the last six months we have been stabilising the relationship with China without any concessions. We have reengaged with the Pacific with energy and credibility. We are bolstering our relationship with our alliance partner the United States. We are deepening our historic relationship with the United Kingdom. We are repairing a fundamentally important relationship to Australia with France.</span>

This Prime Minister went to an election on integrity, saying to the Australian people he would look them in the eye and that he could be relied upon. As it turned out, he completely deceived the Australian public. And it was not just on one occasion; this wasn't just a slip of the tongue. This wasn't a Prime Minister who was in full flight during the course of a press conference and misspoke or moved off his speaking points, as we saw this Prime Minister regularly do in the election campaign. He made that promise on 97 occasions.</span>

I'll bet they were, because what he said was based on the research that the Labor Party had done during and up to the election in May. The Australian public wanted to hear from this Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, that they would get a cut to their electricity prices and to their gas prices if Labor was elected. So what did the machine men of the Labor Party do? They came up, Mr Speaker—</span>

Do you know what's happened since the election, Mr Speaker? We have given every opportunity to the Prime Minister to repeat that claim, to say to the Australian public: 'You didn't mishear me during the election campaign. You aren't going crazy. You actually heard—yes, you did—on 97 occasions that Labor, in government, would reduce power prices by $275.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, on 27 occasions now since the election, has been given the opportunity in this parliament to apologise to the Australian people, to say that he made a mistake, to suggest to the Australian people that somehow they misunderstood. That hasn't happened, because that decency that the Prime Minister could express, the apology that he should give to the Australian people, completely escapes him.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when families are seeing an increase in their power prices because of Labor Party policies, at a time when Australians are seeing an increase in their gas prices because of Labor Party policies, they are feeling deceived by this Prime Minister. They wanted to believe in him, they wanted to believe that he was sincere, they wanted to understand that he would deliver on a promise that he made solemnly to them on 97 occasions, and there's no chance of it—no chance of it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what's happened since the election. The Labor Party delivered a budget only a month ago. In that budget the Australian public expected that after five months in government the government would have come up with a plan to deliver on their election promises. That's what they expected in the budget—not unreasonably, either, I might say. What happened in the budget was that Labor said to the Australian public: no $275 cut. There was no mention of $275 anywhere in the papers associated with the budget. So not only can they not say it in this place; they can't say it in their budget papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the budget papers tell us, Mr Speaker? They were very clear. The budget papers delivered in October said two things, amongst many. Firstly, they said that after two years of Labor Party policy the price of electricity would go up by 56 per cent. There was no mention of that before the election. Secondly, they said that gas prices after two years of Labor policy would go up by 44 per cent. Now, I know that Labor isn't too good when it comes to management of the economy or numbers, but surely it doesn't escape even the Australian Labor Party that a promise of $275 is the complete opposite of delivering a 56 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you who does get it, Mr Speaker: Australian families. At the moment, they are facing eight per cent inflation under this Labor government. They are facing increased interest rates. Australian families are coming off fixed interest rates of 1.8 per cent and going up to 4½, and interest rates are going north. They are facing huge increases in every line item in the household budget. We're now getting Australian manufacturers who are talking about moving offshore because they're worried about the instability in the system. They're worried about massive increases well beyond the 56 per cent and well beyond the 44 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To compound the Prime Minister's deception of the Australian people, they have now concocted this argument that somehow the war in Ukraine—the illegal invasion by Russia into Ukraine in February this year—is the excuse for not delivering the $275. Let's be very clear about this, because this deception was repeated in question time again today. I wish I had more time. I wish the government would allow us to have the debate, but let me say this—on 24 February Russia invaded Ukraine. Since that date, the Prime Minister has personally promised on 28 occasions to cut power bills by $275. Today, the Prime Minister is saying we can't deliver on the $275 because of Russia going into Ukraine. Yet since Russia has gone into Ukraine the Prime Minister has repeated that promise to deliver the $275 price cut on 28 occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people aren't stupid. They are not stupid. They can see a fake and a phony a mile away. I'll you what—they saw in Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. They are seeing this government make critical economic mistakes right now, including significant changes to the industrial relations system which will come as a wet blanket across the Australian economy at exactly the wrong time. The Australian public and small businesses get it. They know that at the last election they were deceived by this Prime Minister. They thought he was a man whose word he would honour and whose word they could trust, and he has demonstrated to them time after time, before and since the election, that he does not live up to his word. There are 28 occasions—and I am very happy to table that and to go through each and every one of the quotes: on 3AW, on AFR, on ABC in Townsville, at a doorstop by the Prime Minister in Tasmania, on <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> Extra, on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">News Breakfast</span> and on Channel 7 news. This Prime Minister says one thing to the Australian public before an election, and then does the complete opposite after. So, don't believe a word this Prime Minister has to say when it comes to electricity prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, with the policies that they are delivering, with what they have promised in their budget, your power prices are going up. Your electricity prices are going up. Your gas prices are going up. I say to the Australian public: don't trust this Prime Minister.</span>

You see, this is a prime minister who didn't know the interest rate but thought he could promise you cheaper mortgages. This is a prime minister who said the number 275 ninety-seven times before the election, but hasn't said it since. This is a prime minister who's not very good with numbers even though he likes to quote his economics degree and all the genuine intel he has about how the economy works. He couldn't name the interest rate but he promised you cheaper mortgages.</span>

We're here for the small manufacturers. We're here for the farmers. We're here for the small businesses that you come into this place and laugh at every single question time. We know that they're hurting and we know that they expected better from you, Prime Minister. They expected better from your front bench, who sits here and jeers and sneers and laughs and puts down the ordinary Australians who are counting on you, who listen to the promises you made. You can't say one thing six months ago, come into parliament and roll out an agenda that is full of excuses, because people want solutions. They don't want excuses. The people who are contacting us every day want answers to their problems. They don't want an industry minister who can't talk to the resources minister. They don't want a treasurer who wrings his hands and says, 'It's all awful because of what happened in Russia.' They don't want a prime minister who comes to this dispatch box and laughs, sneers and jeers at the genuine problems they're facing.</span>

They were promised a plan for cheaper electricity. They were promised a plan for wages, and even the government's own budget papers demonstrate that real wages will not go up in this term. Where do this government's priorities lie? Only in ramming through their radical and extreme industrial relations agenda and the hurt that will cause small business. The Minister for Small Business could not name a single small business, and neither, with respect, Prime Minister, could you name a single small business that supports this radical industrial relations agenda. You and your team, Prime Minister, have prioritised the unions—</span>

                  </a>  The priorities of this government are the union movement and payback to their bosses. I think it's $100 million, Prime Minister, over 15 years in donations that have gone to the Australian Labor Party. I guess that counts for something. I guess that means payback needs to happen and I guess that's why your radical and extreme industrial relations agenda has taken priority over the needs of ordinary families, of small businesses, of Australians who are hurting, who know that their energy costs are getting higher and higher. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Your own energy minister is reminding us how much energy is going up, how much more expensive it's going to be for households, how much the gas prices are going up. But never, never do we see a plan, so it's vital, Mr Speaker, that standing orders are suspended so that we can properly hold this government to account for the promises it has made and the promises it has broken. I want to remind people what those promises were: you would see real wage cuts, you would see cheaper mortgages, your wages would go up. By the way, you don't get wages moving by putting the brakes on business, and that seems to be your only policy at the moment. Meanwhile, for people and householders their energy bills are going up, their repayments are going up, their pay is going backwards because this government lacks a cost-of-living plan. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A cost-of-living plan would give ordinary families and households and businesses some hope, some reassurance, some comfort going into the Christmas period that, as they come out the other side, things are actually going to get better. We are indeed facing challenging global economic times, and we'd like to understand that this government has a plan and that this government has their back. But clearly that is not the message you are giving. Suspension of standing orders is vital. I must repeat, Prime Minister, it is vital that you explain to this House, this parliament and the Australian people: what is your plan for a cheaper cost of living for every Australian? </span>

At least the Leader of the Opposition has come out of hiding. He's actually had something to say in this chamber. The last media conference the Leader of the Opposition held was on 3 November. He's taken a vow of silence. From 3 November to 1 December he has not held a press conference—not one! But to be fair, this week he's done two media interviews. They've been tough! First was the weekly interview with Ray Hadley—he holds him to account every Thursday! And last night there was that tough interrogation from Paul Murray! This is what Paul Murray asked last night:</span>

It's hard to tell, because last week he did two interviews as well and he had two questions in the whole week. And guess how many matters of public importance the Leader of the Opposition has done in this parliament. I'll give you a clue: it's a really round number—not one! Not once has this Leader of the Opposition had the confidence to come to this dispatch box after question time and say, 'Today I know what the most important matter is'—not once.</span>

We said we'd give aged-care workers a pay rise, and we have. We said we'd make medicines cheaper, and we have. We said we'd have 180,000 fee-free TAFE places, and we have. We said we'd pass the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and we have. We said we'd have 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave, and we have.

We said, after a decade of denial, that we would legislate for net zero and 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, and we have.  We said we'd restore Australia's international reputation, and we have. We're out there restoring relationships with our Pacific neighbours.</span>

Sorry I thought that was funny. Sorry about that'—let alone, of course, their relationship with France, their relationship with the United States or their relationship with ASEAN.</span>

I make no apologies for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud of my team and what we have done in our first six months, delivering on promise after promise after promise—a contrast to their record. In their last six months, what did they do? They said they'd have a religious discrimination bill, and then they pulled their own bill. Wages were going backwards. They didn't order enough rapid antigen tests. They spent money from their Disaster Relief Fund. Nope, didn't bother to get around to that. We have been looking after communities that have been suffering from the emergencies that have continued. They hid an energy policy, they hid an environmental report, they hid information, but, most importantly, they hid who their ministers were. They had a shadow government. And, yesterday, they defended a bloke who actually stood here and said, 'I would have told you who the ministers were and that I'd been sworn into six portfolios, but no-one asked.' And they queued up to kiss the ring after the speech--they queued up! It was just an extraordinary performance of sycophancy from a political party that failed to stand up—failed to stand up for parliamentary functioning and for our democracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I went to the election saying that I would bring people together, those opposite are just interested in dividing people. State premiers—ask Premier Perrottet who he prefers to deal with, the federal Labor government now or the former Morrison government. Go and ask him! He'll tell you. Go and ask the Tasmanian Premier, Premier Rockliff, who he's happy to deal with. We delivered the Marinus plan. You talked about it for six years; we've delivered in six months. We have a plan for the future. They've left 10 years of mess. We won't waste a day. They wasted a decade. We believe no-one should be left behind. Those opposite had a conscious economic plan to leave people behind by driving wages low. We want a future made here in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, we advanced the National Reconstruction Fund to do just that. Contrast that with those opposite, when a former Treasurer stood at this despatch box and dared the car industry to leave, with real consequences for manufacturing and our capacity to have a complex economy. We believe that clean, cheap energy will drive our economy in the future. We believe that clean, cheaper energy can drive advanced manufacturing here in Australia. We believe in opportunities for those jobs through increased funding for TAFE and through increased funding for universities. But we also believe in helping our youngest Australians through our childcare package and our oldest Australians through our aged-care plans.</span>

Those opposite just have a sulk about how dare the Australian people, in a polling booth, on 21 May, take away what they regard as their born-to-rule mentality. I'll tell you this: they need to have a bit of a reset over the summer months and come back, be constructive, and have some plans rather than the absurd, weak opposition that we see before us today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Chisholm for that question. I know she has been advocating for cost-of-living relief as a key priority across her electorate. At the Jobs and Skills Summit in September, we as a government said we would deliver more incentives for pensioners to take up more work and help with labour shortages. I am very pleased to inform the House today that we have delivered. Age pensioners can now earn more without affecting their pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Albanese Labor government's $4,000 work bonus income boost has come into effect. We are making this process easier for pensioners. They won't need to do a thing. This temporary increase will automatically be credited to eligible work bonus income banks upfront, so they will be able to earn an additional $4,000 from employment income up to 31 December. This change gives more flexibility to those who are already working to take up extra work. We know a lot of pensioners want to enjoy their retirement and don't want to do that extra work. But, for those that do, this immediate top-up to the work bonus income comes at a great time for those wanting to take up some short-term seasonal work, particularly those that want to bring some Christmas cheer to young children in shopping centres all around Australia. This is just one of the measures that this government has delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would ease the cost-of-living pressures and help older Australians keep more money in their pockets. In the lead-up to the election, we said we would freeze the social security deeming rates. We have delivered on this, freezing them at their current rate for two years to 30 June 2024. This will protect around 900,000 age pensioners and other pension recipients from the impact that deeming rates can have on their pension rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, we passed legislation to increase the income limits for those on the Commonwealth seniors health card, extending access to an additional 50,000 self-funded retirees, who will benefit from cheaper access to medicines and health care. In just the first two weeks, I am really pleased to report to the House that we saw around 10,000 senior Australians put in their application for one of these cards, a pleasing uptick in the numbers compared to the previous period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would deliver cost-of-living relief, and we have. We have also delivered on our commitment to make it easier for pensioners selling and buying a new home, with our legislation on downsizing going through the parliament. We are delivering tangible help for older Australians to help them get by in times when the cost of living and other challenges are making it difficult for them. Older Australians have worked hard; they deserve a government that will deliver for them, and that's what we are doing.</span>

I think she is referring to the Climate Change Authority advice which I tabled in the House earlier today. I commend it to all honourable members—it's a very good report—together with the other documents I tabled. The Climate Change Authority advice I tabled underlines the size of the challenge. I think the honourable member would agree. We have had 12 million tonnes of average annual emissions reduction over the last decade. We need to hit 17 million tonnes from today and every year in order to meet our targets, in order to meet net zero. That is a big task. But the government's determination—and, I'm sure, the country's determination—is up to that task.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the honourable member's question, what the government intends to do is exactly what we promised to do, and that is to reform the safeguard mechanism, to drive down emissions in existing facilities and in all facilities. We will not reduce emissions in Australia unless we get them down from our 200 biggest emitters. That is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I introduced the safeguard mechanism reform bill into the House. That's one small part of the reform—although it was, to be fair, something the previous government was planning to do, so I would expect them to support it, given they'd actually promised to do it, but we'll see what they do. But that is one small part of the reforms.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be issuing a draft regulation in coming weeks which will outline the government's approach, following a very extensive consultation process, which includes how to deal with new entrants into the safeguards facility, whether they be entrants which go over the 100,000-tonne limit for the first time or greenfields entrants. It will explain all of those details, after 240 submissions which the government has very extensively gone through. I think I'm right in saying that the honourable member put in a submission, which I read and which was well thought out. I look forward to issuing that draft regulation. And I will take questions from honourable members here in the House or privately.</span>

I'm very happy to report that the last six months can be summed up in one word, and that is 'delivery'. Since May, I've been to every single corner of this country, from the Torres Strait to Tasmania, from the south-east coast to Perth, and just about everywhere in between. In the member's own electorate I've stood with him as we've talked about our commitment to deliver Avoca Drive, an important project for communities across his region. In New South Wales, I've stood with the member for Hunter as we've delivered the funding needed for Coulsons Creek Road and the Muswellbrook bypass. I've stood with Senator Nita Green in the Torres Strait as we've delivered funding needed for maritime infrastructure and jetties, and in Cairns, as we've delivered city-shaping projects, along with Exit 49 in South-East Queensland, and launched the new electric refueller at Brisbane airport. I've stood in Yuendumu with the member for Lingiari as we upgrade the Tanami. And I've flown over Middle Arm with the member for Solomon to inspect the site that will create thousands of jobs in the Northern Territory. I've been to the Bridgewater Bridge, to the Burnie shiploader, and to UTAS in Launceston. I've joined our members in the west in the High Wycombe community hub, METRONET and Flynn Drive in Wanneroo. In Victoria, we're getting started on delivering, with the Victorian government, the Suburban Rail Loop, a project overwhelmingly backed by Victorian voters—not once, not twice, but three times at the polls now. And of course I've been here in Canberra, not only for parliament but also to inspect the light rail we'll deliver in partnership with the ACT government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not only are we delivering on our promises to build a better future; we've delivered on our promises to clean up the mess left by nine long years of a wasted coalition government. We've ended the worst of the rorts, closing down the Commuter Car Park Fund, replacing the Building Better Regions Fund with two new funds totalling a billion dollars, that regional communities can actually rely on across all regions, not just some. We're supporting cities by delivering a National Urban Policy framework and establishing the Cities and Suburbs Unit, renewing the Urban Policy Forum and bringing back the state of the cities report. We're reforming Infrastructure Australia—that important economic advisory body, so trashed by those opposite. We've ended the political fights with states and territories, partnering with them to deliver the projects that matter to communities, right across this country. We're creating a strategic fleet to regrow Australian shipping. We're working on an aviation white paper to create and grow jobs in that sector. And we've started the work to get Inland Rail back on track and high-speed rail here in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition will speak to this motion as well, and I thank him for his cooperation. I do want to say that a few of us are a bit dusty this morning—a bit tired. I, the Minister for Sport and, I'm sure, others were exchanging messages through Twitter and in text messages in the early hours of this morning. When it was nil-all at half-time, I think that Australians who were up at that time—about three o'clock at half-time—were very hopeful of going forward. But the truth is that the Danes had had most of the attack in the first 30 minutes. But Australia really were coming back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, you had that extraordinary goal from Mathew Leckie on the break, where he went left, went right, went left again and nailed it with his left foot into the corner to send us into the lead. You then had, I think, quite an extraordinary period, including those terrible last six minutes, when it went up, where Australians—whether they were at Fed Square or in their homes—were all just hoping that Australia could hang on. There was corner after corner; there was attack after attack from the Danes, and I pay tribute to them. They kept coming at the Socceroos, but the Socceroos had a strategy. They went to a back five when they led one-nil, and it was an extraordinary win against a very high-class team. If you look at the salaries of the Danish team and the Australian team, I reckon that we're getting pretty good value from our team. It was also, of course, a fantastic win over Tunisia after a really tough first game against the World Cup champions, France.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that the celebrations we saw around the nation in the early hours of this morning were almost as entertaining to watch as the game itself. To the Socceroos we say as a country, 'You have done us proud.' I do note that the coach, Graham Arnold, who drinks at the Sackville Hotel in my electorate, has said that he made sure they rested after game 2 and that they got off social media, so they mightn't hear about this. But they should know that all Australians are on their side, and we'll be cheering them on against Argentina, who, of course, with Lionel Messi represent one of the great teams in world football.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the world game, football. It's watched by more than any other sport. It will be a fantastic boost, as the commentators were saying overnight, including Craig Foster—who does such amazing work at Addi Road in my electorate—along with Mark Bosnich in the commentating that I think we all watched afterwards. The problem with staying up at that time is that when you have a win like that it's very hard to just turn off the TV, and I certainly didn't for some period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think that it is a fantastic achievement. I do note the calls around Australia for a public holiday to be declared. I'm afraid that at this point in time it was a bit late, at four in the morning, to call a public holiday today. But I reckon if we win the World Cup, well, that might be a different story. So we'll wait and see how that goes. I think that would be very hard to resist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to pay tribute to the work that Anika Wells does as the Minister for Sport. The Minister for Sport was recently in New Zealand. Of course, we will hold the Women's World Cup, and that is going to be a major event for Australia, a major opportunity for tourism and a major opportunity to inspire young girls, in particular, to take up a team sport. Team sport teaches people how to win, how to lose, how to work as a team and how to cooperate and teaches them great social skills as well. Whatever team sport people play, I think, it is always good for young girls and boys to participate as well as good for people in later life if they can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So all the best to the Socceroos. We will all be watching in a week's time. Parliament won't sit, of course, for the rest of the World Cup unless the Senate keeps talking over the next week—and that is possible! I don't discount that possibility. Whenever they stop talking, we will gather back here, but I suspect that we will be watching it from different places rather than together as well. I commend the motion very much to the parliament and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his cooperation and support for this.</span>

It is a pretty amazing outcome to get down to the final 16—unexpected in some ways, but there are the skill and tenacity that they have got, the coaching that they have received and, I suspect, the cheers from the Australian supporters. It's been a pretty remarkable campaign so far. It is, of course, the first time since 2006 and only the second time in the World Cup history that we've got to this point. This is going to be a tough game against Argentina, but they've got a lot of mettle and a lot of capacity within the team.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to all those supporters who are over in Qatar at the moment for the passion they've got and the sacrifices they have made. In many cases, I suspect, they've spent a small fortune getting there. They will get the credit card bill when they get home, but they will be having the time of their lives. To see those Australian flags flying proudly with those supporters over there should make us all very proud indeed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a shout-out to the No. 1 ticket holder for football here in the Australian parliament: that's Dom from Aussie's Cafe. You can't go and get a cup of coffee without it blaring in the background! If you go to the gym at six o'clock in the morning, he's already there and it's up on every TV screen. I don't know whether he's making any money at the moment, but he is certainly watching many of the games on TV! I'm sure he is, like many Australian around the country at the moment, not only very proud of the Socceroos but proud of what the world game of football does for relations.</span>

Your hard work in keeping the chamber running has not gone unnoticed, particularly by me, and your procedural expertise is, as usual, impeccable. To the chamber attendants, staff supporting committees, the Serjeant-at-Arms, finance, people strategies, communications and support staff: I thank you all on behalf of members for your hard work this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge a very longstanding departmental employee who has recently retired. Many of you would know Rod Carn, who supported this parliament, both the old and the new, for more than 40 years. Rod worked in security and member services and is now understandably missed by his colleagues, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Rod for his service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services we say a huge thankyou. The show could not go on without the work of the amazing cleaners, security, building support, and the chefs, waitstaff and everyone in between who keep us well fed and caffeinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my fellow members and your hardworking staff: it's been an absolute pleasure and privilege working alongside you this year, particularly the new members, the class of 2022, and the largest crossbench ever elected since federation. I have had the pleasure of getting to know you all. I thank you for all your support in my role as Speaker. There's no handbook on how to be Speaker, but you've shown me incredible kindness and patience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Deputy Speaker and my friend the member for Newcastle, Sharon Claydon: you have been a tremendous support to me this year, and I've thoroughly enjoyed working with you in support of this chamber over a cuppa every morning before we start work. You are a warrior in this chamber for so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Second Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Moore, I thank you for your sage advice and wonderful support to the Speaker's panel. You've stepped up to assist the running of these chambers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the Prime Minister. Your support for my speakership has meant a lot as I settle into this new role, an important role. I hope you get to enjoy some time off with Jodie, Nathan and Toto, and better luck next year with the Rabbitohs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Dickson, you've been a strong leader in your party this year, and I hope you, Kirilly and the kids enjoy a happy Christmas together and we get the hot Queensland summer that we know and love, except for all the rain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Leader of the Nationals, my fellow classmate in the class of 2016, thank you for being so quiet during question time and being a top bloke, sometimes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the House deserves a big break. Your quick work in the chamber has kept us all on our toes, me included. Your friendship and leadership are appreciated by many across the political spectrum. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to the Manager of Opposition Business and the member for Bradfield, the wonderful thing about this House is that we can be debating points of order furiously one moment and catching up for a cup of coffee right after. I've very much enjoyed getting to know you, and I appreciate your professionalism and leadership in your new role, which I now appreciate is the second-hardest job in this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a privilege being your Speaker, and I wish you all and your families a very happy and safe Christmas. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Speaker's schedule to the House of Representatives on the status of government responses to committee reports is presented at six monthly intervals, usually in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The last schedule was presented in the House on 1 December 2021. The schedule presents a list of committee reports that contain recommendations requiring a government response. Government responses received during the period are included in the schedule and the report it relates to is then removed from subsequent schedules. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The timeframe for government responses to committee reports in this schedule is determined by the resolution adopted by the House on 29 September 2010, in which government responses to House and Joint committee reports are required within a six month period from the presentation of the report in the House. The Senate has resolved to require government responses to Senate and Joint committee reports within three months of a report being tabled.<span style="font-style:italic;">[</span><span style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span style="font-style:italic;">]</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This schedule does not list reports that do not require a government response. In the past, the practice was to include all reports tabled in the Speaker's schedule. However, the intent of this schedule is to provide an update to the House on the status of government responses to committee reports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations that are wider than the provision of the bill and would therefore be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to bill inquiry reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, and the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries). Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' regular scrutiny reports on the human rights compatibility of bills and legislative instruments are not listed, as the timeframe for a response is specified in correspondence to the relevant minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. Responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within six months of the tabling of a report. Executive Minutes are included in this schedule and are listed as (Partial response)</span>

I advise the House that the heads of the two agencies for which I'm the responsible minister have taken the initiative of agreeing to establish a joint review of this matter. This will involve the appointment of an eminent Australian working across Services Australia and the NDIA. This arrangement will ensure there is no real or perceived conflict of interest that might exist were agencies to investigate themselves. It will provide important independence as we seek to get to the bottom of the matter of whether there was any misconduct. Australian taxpayers and voters have the right to know whether there's been any impropriety, and equally to be assured that government contracting processes are independent and merit based, not swayed by special interests or lobbyists. The terms of reference for this review will be finalised in coming days and weeks. </span>

I reiterate what I told the House last week. I reject their implied imputations in the strongest possible language. I reiterate that all departmental procurements were run with the highest levels of probity, and to that end I formally wrote to the CEO of Services Australia first thing this morning to request that she provide probity confirmation to me so that I can provided it the House, as is appropriate. That was of my initiative this morning. The ECE project tender the minister referred to was released almost 12 months before I became a minister, and I believe was in contract negotiation when I was sworn in. I had zero involvement with this procurement or any other procurements, and I reject completely these accusations. I look forward to the report of whatever process the minister sees fit to put in to ensure transparency and accountability.</span>

The advice that I have from my leadership team in the Senate is that this matter will be finalised tonight in the Senate. There is an ability within the Senate for the sitting to continue late tonight and for the conclusion of the matter to be arrived at, for the legislation to be passed, so that bill can come back in its final form to the House tomorrow.</span>

All I say is that the very clear advice, given that we are the ones running the debate in the Senate, is that it will be dealt with in the Senate tonight, and it'll be back here, if we want to come back, at eight o'clock or nine o'clock in the morning. We'll be in a position to deal with it, to finalise it and for people to go home and save the expense, frankly, of people having to fly back on Saturday morning, with the additional travel allowance.

The root cause of the difficulty is that the government tried to eliminate a week of estimates. That's the root cause of the difficulty. The government, supposedly committed to accountability and transparency, put up a sitting program that had fewer weeks for estimates than has historically been the case. This is a chaotic process. It's very unfortunate that the government was not able to manage this better.</span>

Life was going to be cheaper under Labor. We heard before the election that mortgages were going to be cheaper. And what did we get? We got six consecutive increases in the cash rate, to 2.85 per cent, and we know it's going higher. Before the election, they promised lower cost of living, and what did we get? We got inflation going above seven per cent, and the Reserve Bank says it's on its way to eight per cent. Before the election, we heard that electricity prices were going to be lower, a $275 reduction. And what did we get? Ninety-seven times before the election we heard they were going to be cheaper, but, since then, the Prime Minister has been asked 28 times—including twice more today—if he will commit to the $275 reduction, and each time he has refused to recommit. </span>

The big opportunity Labor had to deal with this was in the budget. But we have a Treasurer whose focus as a Treasurer is on doom, gloom, forecasting and commentary. This is a Treasurer that wouldn't know a plan if he fell over it. What we got in the budget, instead, in October, was a complete flop. There is no other way to describe it. </span>

Instead, we got a singer. We got Taylor Swift. We got a blank space. We got absolutely nothing out of this budget. We got something that sank to the bottom of the ocean within a couple of days. The Treasurer has chosen, on a now famous occasion, to mishear questions about the budget. No-one bothers to ask him questions about the budget anymore, because he mishears them anyway. The truth is that I would be mishearing questions about that budget if I had handed it down, because it was absolutely hopeless!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of a comprehensive plan to consolidate the strong economic position and the strong budget that the Treasurer inherited, we got growing deficits and no medium-term fiscal strategies. They have given up on budget balance. They've given it away. It's gone! For the first time since the Charter of Budget Honesty was put in place, there is no commitment to budget balance. They have absolutely given up the ghost. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of delivering economic growth, which is what we wanted to see, we have $142 billion of extra taxes in the budget. Compared to the March budget, if you take the forwards over the four years, there are $142 billion of extra taxes—and right at the heart of that is that sneaky thief in the night, bracket creep, that those opposite want to keep. They want taxes going up, automatically, every year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of a productivity agenda we got more red tape and industrial relations chaos. Instead of managing spending, we got an extra $115 billion of spending in this budget. The Treasurer himself has admitted: with more spending comes higher interest rates. He said it. The member for Parramatta, over there, knows this. Any economist knows it: more spending; higher interest rates. We've even heard an economist to Julia Gillard, Stephen Koukoulas, make this very clear. </span>

                  </a>  The Kouk. This is a budget that has left the Reserve Bank carrying the can. In fact, Steven Hamilton put it very well when he said it was an irresponsible budget. Right at the heart of this budget is an acceptance that rising inflation, in the view of the Treasurer, is okay—a 56 per cent increase in electricity prices; a 44 per cent increase in gas prices—and, on top of that, they've given up the ghost on productivity. He's scaled down productivity from 1.5 to 1.2 per cent a year. That means less money in people's pockets, less wealth. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk every day. In fact, before the election we heard time and time again about real wages, that they would go up. In their own forecast, there is no increase in real wages in this term of the parliament—none. Gone! They have given up on it. They have given up the ghost. They've put up the white flag. As a result, Australians will be paying more at Christmas. Australians will be worse off because those opposite have given up on their commitments. We know that a family with a $750,000 mortgage is now paying more than $1,200 extra every month. In the electorates of those opposite, $1,200 every month. Australians are going to be going to the checkout at the fuel bowser this Christmas knowing that this government does not have their back when it comes to the cost of living. They've broken the most basic promises they made before the election.</span>

We don't know which one of them leaked from cabinet. One of them did, clearly. We don't know which one. Everyone's trying to guess. Then the next day it was price caps on gas, and then the next day it was price caps on coal. I don't know what's coming tomorrow. Who knows? But we do know that even Labor states are saying, 'Not good enough!' A couple of weeks ago the Western Australian government said, 'No way, don't even think about those policies.' Then a couple of days ago the Queensland government said, 'No way, don't even think about those policies.' Then today we read that South Australia is saying exactly the same. This is a government that has no idea. It is all smear and no idea.</span>

He's part of the team, and it takes the team to make a mess of things. He is the leader of chaos in the Treasury portfolio. One would think that getting through bills--which we support and which we supported when we were in government--would be pretty straightforward. They are straightforward pieces of legislation that we still support, but not the Assistant Treasurer. He has decided to unilaterally implement $1.1 billion of fines on executives in the financial services industry. He made a deal with the Greens that wasn't needed, and then he walked back on it in less than 24 hours. There's been a bit of commentary about this. Michael Roddan wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review</span> just a few days ago about the recent performance of the Assistant Treasurer:</span>

Not only has he completely failed to commit or recommit to be $275 electricity price reduction; he does not understand the electricity industry at all. In fact, he claims that one gigawatt of electricity was committed or built under us. The answer is: in the last three years of government, it was 18.9 gigawatts. He's only out by a factor of 19. And, in each one of those years, more renewables were built than in the entire time those opposite were in government. Those opposite are all smear and no idea.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  The shadow Treasurer started out his interesting speech by quoting Taylor Swift from the album <span style="font-style:italic;">1989</span>. That album was released eight years ago. Taylor Swift has managed to release five albums since. In the same period of time, those opposite managed to deliver a trillion dollars of debt—although, in fairness, maybe it's $500 billion for former Treasurer Frydenberg and $500 billion for secret Treasurer Morrison. Maybe there was a bit of job sharing there. They delivered us three Prime Ministers. They delivered us a few Deputy Prime Ministers—some better than others. They delivered us five secret ministries. In the same time that Taylor Swift managed to get those five albums out, those opposite managed to have 22 failed energy policies and didn't deliver one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer also decided that it was appropriate to quote some interesting pieces from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>—it is a great paper of record; I read it every morning—so I might do the same. I refer to the article titled 'ScoMo's besties feed him to the wolves', which notes that some of the closest declared so-called friends of the former Prime Minister—some might call them frenemies—had some interesting things to say. Former prime minister Hawke said that former prime minister Morrison 'wasn't the greatest listener'. I think that might be the understatement of 2022—wasn't the greatest listener. We then saw his great friend the member for Fadden say:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an excellent qualification of a strong endorsement. I think the most appropriate, the most serious, statement was from former Treasurer Frydenberg who described the secret ministries scandal as 'extreme overreach'. It's good to see that those who are no longer under the puppetry of the former Prime Minister can actually say what they believe about the secret ministries scandal, whereas everyone else on the coalition benches was forced to back in what they knew to be wrong when they voted to defend the secret ministries scandal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While some chose to spend their time defending what was, frankly, the indefensible over the last few months, which is what this MPI is about, this government got to work delivering the sorts of legislation that we went to the Australian people saying we would deliver. This government has introduced 85 separate bills in six months. So many of them, as I looked through the list, would not have happened if it weren't for the election of the Albanese Labor government.</span>

We have the comprehensive royal commission to aged care response bill. We have the climate change bill, acting on climate change, something that those opposite refused to legislate on. We have the Jobs and Skills Australia Bill, giving us long-term planning for the jobs and skills needs of Australia. We have the bill to repeal the cashless debit card, which was introduced and passed thanks to the work done on this side of the House. We had legislation, again passed by this House, to give a tax cut for electric cars, the only tax cut those opposite seem to oppose.</span>

We have the incentives for pensioners to downsize. We have something that I know you, Deputy Speaker Claydon, are very fond of—the High Speed Rail Authority Bill, which will help connect so many parts of our country. We have the respect at work bill; the cheaper child care bill; the National Anti-Corruption Commission Bill, a piece of legislation, now the law of the land, that was promised to the Australian people in 2018 but which was never delivered because those opposite never believed in it. They just wanted to get it off the agenda. We have the offshore electricity infrastructure legislation, which will make sure we can have more renewables plugged into our grid.</span>

If they want to give us a lecture about the cost of living, let them be honest: I'd love to see just one member of the opposition come to that dispatch box and admit that the biggest pressure, the biggest growing cost, on our budget today is the trillion dollars of debt that was left by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Liberal-National government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have improvements for paid parental leave, making sure that families can spend more time together—again, legislation that is in front of this House only because the people of Australia chose to change the government. We have the bill that was introduced today to enable a vote for a Voice to Parliament. That will enable next financial year the Australian people to have a say and for that referendum to be held, in a similar way to how we hold elections in this country, in 2022-23. The last piece of proposed legislation that was introduced into this place today for the end of this sitting was the Ministers of State Amendment Bill, to make sure that never again do we have the parliament treated with such contempt that members who sit in this chamber do not know who is holding what portfolio or when they became the minister for that portfolio and indeed to ensure that other ministers never have the experience that some opposite had, where they never knew that they were job-sharing but their boss did.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not find the argument put forward by the shadow Treasurer to be particularly persuasive—that every problem Australia faces today started on 21 May. I know that's what those opposite are trying to put forward, but so many of these were many years in the making. I have to agree with another shadow minister, whom I have some respect for, a West Australian, the shadow defence minister, who really told the truth about what happened in the former government just over the past few years:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the six months and what has been delivered for the Australian people, we have had an increase in the minimum wage, because this side was elected and wrote to the Fair Work Commission supporting an increase. We had a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, some of the hardest working people in the care economy. We've had medicine prices reduced to $30 per script, down from $42. We have 180,000 fee-free TAFE places. We've ended the cashless debit card. We've started the robodebt royal commission, so that people who had unfair fines, and the stress that came with them, put in their letterbox can finally get justice. We've got child care that will be on average $1,700 cheaper for families. We've got an extra 20,000 university places for people from low socioeconomic and disadvantaged backgrounds. We've got legislation in front of the parliament right now to close the gender pay gap, and we've got action in our local communities: in Boothby, a $200 million investment in Flinders Medical Centre; in Reid, an $8.5 million investment in the Hill Road upgrade; in Moreton, a koala crossing to help our beloved koalas get from one part of Toohey Forest to another; and in Chisholm, the Box Hill City Oval upgrade—much needed for those communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We go further, because it's not just about cost of living; it's also about quality of living—quality of food in aged care; quality of voice for those who might not feel this parliament always hears them, and I commend the work Minister Aly has done with the Youth Steering Committee; quality of living when it comes to secure jobs, so people can have secure jobs, and outlawing things such as sexual harassment, which is attached to the legislation in front of the Senate right now; quality of living in being able to get a doctor and see a doctor with bulk-billing, through 50 Medicare urgent care clinics. I remember the Liberal National cost-of-living record: cuts to JobKeeper, frozen Medicare payments, hiked-up university fees and 22 failed energy policies. They tried to force Western Australia to privatise Western Power, and they said low wage growth was a deliberate design feature of their budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We were the ones who instigated JobKeeper, which saved 700,000 jobs during a global pandemic. The member for Perth asked what we got for, to use his term, a trillion dollars worth of debt, and he said that is placing the pressure on the current government as far as cost of living is concerned. It's not a trillion dollars. But what that debt did for the Australian public was it retained their jobs and, moreover, it kept their lives safe. During the pandemic, when we were faced—</span>

When we were faced with potentially 50,000 lives being lost due to the global pandemic, we made urgent steps. Yes, we were just about to get back in black, and what we did was we made sure that we Australians' lives safe. We did was we made sure we kept Australians' jobs safe. Yes, we racked up the debt, but it was necessary, it was needed, and it was the right and responsible thing to do. That's what we did.</span>

You don't get thrown out of the party. I know—I've done it. I voted against the Murray-Darling Basin draft plan and the buybacks that Labor wanted to introduce. I wasn't kicked out of the party.

And many small businesses are worried about whether they can make ends meet, including one who texted me. I won't read it all out because we've already had one little unparliamentary remark, and I wouldn't do that. It says: 'Our power prices at—' I won't mention the company' are increasing 330 per cent and gas prices rising 400 per cent from 1 January. We'll be paying an extra $5 million per year.' That is a Wagga Wagga firm. How does a regional business cope with such a cost rise? How does a Wagga business continue to employ the people it has? That company has dozens upon dozens of employees, it's a good company. It's into manufacturing and recycling. It's a good Wagga Wagga company and it's faced with an increase of $5 million on its power bills—just like families and businesses right across the nation are faced with higher power bills, even though the Prime Minster promised on 97 occasions that power prices would come down and electricity prices would drop, and there would be a $275 saving. No. I'm sorry.</span>

I didn't have political fights with states and territories. I got on with the job with states and territories—indeed, most of them were Labor—to make sure that we put in place a national logistics freight code so we could get goods transported around during the pandemic. That happened within hours—not days or weeks or months—because I did have the relationship with those state Labor ministers. I'm proud of the fact that I got on and built things with state Labor ministers. I wait to see if those opposite do the same in their term of office.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I rise today to reject this nonsense matter of public importance from the shadow Treasurer, because there is only one party who has improving the lives of Australians struggling with a rising cost of living at heart, and that is the Labor Party and this Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember back to May this year, a short six months ago. Hasn't so much changed since then? So much has changed that it appears those opposite have forgotten Maybe they've been gaslighted, so let me refresh their memories. While all of us in this place were busily travelling across our electorates speaking to voters, the former government was presiding over an economy heaving under a trillion dollars of debt and far too little to show for it. Before the election, interest rates were rising, and the outlook was that there was more to come. They had rising power prices, increases which they deliberately hid from the Australian people and which were borne out of a decade of wasted opportunities. And was it 20 or 22 failed energy policies? Childcare prices had also risen some 41 per cent. The cost of health care was rising and rising, because, while those opposite like to talk about bulk billing rates, what they don't tell you is that, while some items might be bulk billed, the underlying consultation is likely not. Boothby residents told me of the difficulty in finding a bulk billing GP, let alone a specialist, in the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to take the opposition at face value—and it's not clear we should, but, in the spirit of consensus and goodwill, let us—after nine long years they have suddenly had a conversion on the road to Damascus and are now suddenly deeply concerned about the cost of living. This is after nine long years of doing precisely nothing about it. Instead, for nine years they presided over deliberate wage suppression. That's less money in the pockets of Australian workers to pay power bills, to send the kids to school or to save for a rainy day—deliberate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that they are so concerned with the cost of living, surely all that's changed and they'll be doing everything in their power to ensure more Australians have more in their pockets from higher wages. It turns out: no. They have fought this government's attempts to get wages moving to fix a broken bargaining system, particularly for those workers in the low-paid feminised sectors that we relied on throughout the pandemic, like aged care, child care, cleaning and health care. They have fought our secure jobs, better pay bill tooth and nail every step of the way. Even now, we heard in question time, there are 19 amendments underway in the other place. These are further delays, because they're not actually serious about tackling the cost of living. After nine years of their economic vandalism, these challenges are real, and I see them in my electorate. If you're serious about tackling cost-of-living challenges, you need to invest in the productive capacity of the Australian economy and in the capacity of the Australian people for the long term. That's exactly what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting on with doing the long-term structural reform needed to actually create an economy that works for people, not the other way around. We're investing in future generations of Australians by making cheaper child care for 96 per cent of families in the system. This is, of course, an important social reform, with more kids accessing quality early learning during key developmental years, but it's also a huge economic dividend. Cheaper child care means women can choose to take on more employment and bring more income into the household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we're reforming our industrial relations system to drive productivity and get wages moving. We backed a raise in the minimum wage, which is benefiting 2.8 million Australians. We backed a long overdue 15 per cent pay rise for frontline aged-care workers as an interim measure. We've legislated to enable those on age pensions, if they so wish, to work more hours before it affects their pension. We held the national Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing together business, education, unions and civil society to work together to address the critical skills shortage we inherited. Starting 2023, we'll be providing more university and TAFE places and fee-free TAFE to further tackle our skills shortage. We've introduced legislation to establish our National Reconstruction Fund and to begin the process of making Australia a place that makes things again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After six phenomenal months, the Albanese government has been kicking goals in so many areas: international relations, climate change, energy policy, child care and the skills crisis. We've introduced a national anticorruption commission, and there is work being done in so many ways by this government to cut costs in health, child care and education and to address the skills shortage to get the economy going again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Banks) (16:29):</span>  I want to dedicate this speech to the number 275. It's a number that's been made famous by the government. I think we should dwell and reflect on the number 275 over the next five minutes because it's a very, very important number. So many times before the election, the government talked about its solemn, ironclad promise to reduce electricity prices by $275—97 times.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr COLEMAN:</span>
                  </a>  I welcome any interjections on the number 275, because it is a very, very important number in Australian politics. Please, let's talk about 275, because it is a really important number. You know how there is a word of the year each year? If you had a number of the year, this year it would be 275. Do you know what else? It is not only the number of 2022; 275 is going to be the number of 2023. It is going to be the number of 2024. I will tell you what else: it is most definitely going to be the number of 2025. That's because this is the number that is at the centre of Australian politics. It's a number that Australians remember. Everyone is talking about the number 275, except the government. Imagine how you would feel if you were the number 275. Before the election, you were so close with the government, but now you are the number that dare not speak its name. They were so close—275 and the government. It was an intimate relationship. When the Powering Australia policy came out, there it was, up the front: 275. It was in only the first or second sentence. The number 275 was central to that debate—front and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a paper called <span style="font-style:italic;">MyCity Logan</span>. I understand it has a big circulation in the Logan area. The very first sentence when the Treasurer talked to the paper about the 2022 election included the number 275. It's a very difficult thing for the number 275 to be so abandoned. The Prime Minister wrote an op-ed, and a $275 reduction was mentioned in that op-ed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span> in March. Then at the 10 April press conference in Sydney, after a visit to the Royal Easter Show, the number 275—it had such a close relationship with the government—was mentioned again. Then, on 12 April, the Prime Minister went on Triple M in Hobart and talked about a range of issues with the usual jovial demeanour that the Prime Minister puts on in those interviews, and there it was again—the number 275. It is like how <span style="font-style:italic;">Sesame Street</span> has a number of the day. The government's number of the day, the week, the month and the year was 275.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard this really weird thing from the Prime Minister today about the war in Ukraine, which, as the opposition leader said today, started in February. But 18 May was 88 days after the start of the war in Ukraine. It is quite a lot. It's not 275, but it's a lot. In the speech to the National Press Club, there it was again—$275—three days before the election. That was 88 days after the start of the war in Ukraine, and yet the promise persisted. There is, as I am sure members opposite will acknowledge, a logical problem with saying that the Ukraine war changed things when, 88 days after the war started, the Prime Minister said it to the entire nation at the National Press Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister gave a big speech to the energy forum in August, soon after the election—it was a 3,000-word speech—the word 'energy' was mentioned 41 times, but, oddly, the number 275 was not mentioned at all. It has been not mentioned at all by those opposite since the election. Why does this matter? It matters because of the millions of Australians who listened to that discussion about the $275 electricity price cut that this government and this Prime Minister promised over and over again. That's why 275 is such an important number, and it will be for many years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I, too, share the member for Banks's interest in numbers. Let me give him some numbers: five additional ministries that his former Prime Minister decided to swear himself into; and 22 attempts at an energy policy. I think it's particularly galling that the member for Hume, the former Minister for Energy, was the one who rose today to talk about this matter of public importance, because, when it came to an energy policy, the member for Hume as the Minister for Energy had more tries than the NRL season!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank those opposite for the opportunity to talk about what the Albanese Labor government is doing to address cost-of-living pressures. We are doing it in a fiscally responsible way that is ensuring that we also lift productivity, because that's the responsible approach when you are in a challenging economic environment where you have a trillion dollars of debt, low productivity and increasing inflation—all thanks to those opposite.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just six short months, we have passed legislation to make child care cheaper. That is going to benefit more than 1.2 million families, including 7,800 families in my electorate of Reid. We have passed legislation to make medicines cheaper for millions of Australians from 1 January next year. The maximum general co-payment will drop from $42.50 to $30—the first time we've seen a price drop in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Someone taking two or three medications a month could save between $300 and $450 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other critical measure is one that those opposite are allergic to talking about, and that is increasing wages. On this side of the House, we support wage rises. I want to talk about what that means. When my parents came to this country 45 years ago, they spoke very little English and had little formal education, but they were able to build a life for themselves here and, within five years of arriving in this country, they were able to buy a modest home. While some of their success can be attributed to their hard work, it can also be attributed to the jobs that they were able to get and the wages that they were able to earn. They had good jobs with good pay. My dad worked in a factory making car parts, and my mum worked in a factory making telephone handsets. But, had they arrived in this country four decades later, I wonder: would they have been able to thrive? Given their limited English and qualifications, would they have been able to find well-paying jobs? Unlikely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because, under the previous coalition government, wages were kept deliberately low. It was a feature of their economic strategy. It was so ingrained in their psyche that they refused to back a wage increase in line with inflation for our lowest paid workers. However, when now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was asked if he would back a 5.1 per cent increase in the minimum wage, he said simply and unequivocally: 'Absolutely.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what you get when you have a prime minister who is on the side of workers, because on this side of the House we will back our lowest paid workers. They are our childcare workers, aged-care workers, disability workers and essential workers, and they deserve our support. We will back them because they have been doing jobs that are tough and challenging but incredibly important to this country, like our aged-care workers, who are looking after our most elderly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite: if you are serious about addressing cost-of-living pressures then back the secure jobs, better pay bill. It's a bill that will get wages moving, reinvigorate the enterprise bargaining system and allow Australians to meet those rising cost-of-living pressures, because we, on this side of the House, know that good wages are fundamental to helping families get by. It's not too late to get on board. To those opposite who want to talk about this and who think that this is important, I say: get on board and back the secure jobs, better pay bill.</span>

I note that there have been a lot of interjections towards the members on this side. People in the chamber have been quite respectful in not interrupting the other side, allowing them to make their point. Whether we agree or disagree—and I appreciate that this is a chamber of debate—we can do so with some sort of decorum. It's why people up in the gallery walk out of this place shaking their heads, to be perfectly honest. I think we really, on both sides, need to have a look at ourselves and pull our socks up. It's not why I came into this place; I came into the place to be constructive. I'm not lecturing the other side; I'm simply making the point that it achieves nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the member's last contribution, I accept the childcare changes. Fantastic. It's great that mums and dads earning up to $530,000 can access child care and rebates, but the fact is, in the regions, we can't get any childcare places. Now, when I make that point, I don't make the point to criticise the government. I make the point because it's a fact, and I urge the government—</span>

                  </a>  Of course we were in government for nine years—I'll take the interjection—but for how long are you going to run that argument: 'You were in government for nine years'? You've been in government for six months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is what I'm coming back to—that point. I'm not being critical of the other side. I'm making the point in facts. If you're not able to have that debate without getting angry or without shouting down the other members for making points of fact, then perhaps you might want to examine why you're here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you talk about the PBS, again, that was something that this government did. But we're here to discuss the MPI that people are doing it tough. If you want to look at your own budget, there is very little in that budget that assists people in the regions with their cost of living. I spoke of Peter Feros from the Dorrigo Hotel in the chamber last week. Peter Feros owns the Dorrigo Hotel. He had his contract coming up for renewal. The cheapest electricity contract he could get for next year was an increase of $25,000. Where are the measures to bring that down? There are none. In fact, prices are going up by 56 per cent over the next two years, and gas, 44 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trotting out the line it that you inherited $1 trillion in debt is simply misleading the public, because when we came into government it was almost half a trillion. You sat in opposition and you signed up to every single support package to keep our people in work, to keep employers and employees together, and then you trot out this line: 'Oh, you were in government for nine years and you left us a $1 trillion debt.' You came with us all the way. You were there all the way. It was your people and your businesses that benefited from JobKeeper and JobSeeker. The truth sometimes hurts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Obviously, this is a matter of 'not-very-importance', because there are three people opposite for the matter of public importance, so I'm going to digress for a minute and talk about something slightly personal. Today would have been my mum's 90th birthday if she were alive, so happy birthday to Peggy Perrett—Ellen Margaret Perrett—single mother of 10, who produced some wonderful people, including me!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to the matter of public importance. We're actually talking about cost of living, something we on this side of the parliament clearly care about, while those dilettantes opposite pay lip service to it. Since they came into opposition they've been like born-again Vinnies, Salvos, Sikh Volunteers, Muslim Charitable Foundation—those sorts of people. They're cosplaying friends of the working class: Comrade Dutton and the Bolsheviks, who suddenly care about the poor people. Let's look at their record. For 21 of the last 27 years, they've been on the treasury bench. What have they done in terms of looking after the working class? They like to cosplay, but they don't actually understand what their policies have visited on the poor people of Australia. We care about the working class. We care about all Australians. But I remember their policies and the bloodhounds of robodebt, sicking those horrible beasts onto poor people. Lives were lost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a royal commission into insulation when we insulated a couple of million homes, because there were two or three or four deaths. Think of the lives lost because of their decisions. And they're shameless. They don't apologise. The minister responsible for robodebt sits there smirking. We've never had an apology, but they dare to have an MPI to talk about cost-of-living expenses when we know that we've got the settings right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big things is getting the energy costs right. Yesterday we saw former prime minister Abbott's painting hung under the flagpole. Today marks 13 years since Tony Abbott became Leader of the Opposition. Since then, this nation's energy policies have gone to hell in a handbasket. We've had 20-odd energy policies, and all can be traced back to Tony Abbott becoming the leader of that dreadful group opposite. </span>

                  </a>  I'm not going to go through all 20 energy policies, Member for Macnamara, no, but I beg your pardon and take the interjection: 22 energy policies. But all can be traced back to Tony Abbott becoming leader, when he weaponised responding to dangerous climate change, the greatest moral challenge of our time, as it still is: something being visited on our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren because of Tony Abbott becoming leader. For those opposite to stand up and talk about cost of living without apologising for all those energy policies is reprehensible. </span>

Why? Because it's cheaper. They pretend they're grabbing this mythical beast called nuclear energy when everyone, including these people that we call 'scientists' at the CSIRO, tell us that nuclear energy is much more expensive. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what we did for aged care, for manufacturing, for wages. We have done fair dinkum things. They cosplay that they are champions of the poor people in Australia. Their mouths say one thing and their feet do another when it comes to voting in the chamber. They've had a shameful record over the last, I'm going to say, 26 years—if you go back to March 1996. As soon as they got control of the Senate—</span>

                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I rise to address this matter of public importance, a matter that is probably the most important thing that is facing households and businesses in our economy right now: the spiralling cost of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The starkest figure in the economy right now is the gap between inflation and wages growth. Under this government, inflation has now reached 7.3 per cent and, for the same period, the ABS indicates that wages are increasing by 3.1 per cent. Wages growth is less than half of the inflation rate. That is absolutely diabolical. Wages have never been deteriorating more quickly—going back to the 1990s recession—than they are now under this Labor government. The inflation rate of 7.3 per cent is predicted by the government's own budget to go up to eight per cent. They've had the embarrassing circumstance of moving too prematurely self-congratulating motions about increases to the minimum wage of a little over five per cent when inflation, of course, was then revealed to be in the sixes and now the sevens. The Fair Work decision of increasing the minimum wage is actually decreasing the minimum wage in real terms because inflation is running higher than that increase. That is nothing to be proud of; that is something to be absolutely ashamed of. And that is happening on this government's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While real wages are declining at their fastest rate in decades, we've got electricity prices predicted to go up at their fastest rate in decades. Over the next two years, there will be a 56 per cent increase in electricity prices. Of course, this is in an environment where the government went to the last election saying they were going to reduce electricity prices. This is now becoming the totemic great fraud that was inflicted upon the people of this country at the last election. The Labor opposition said they would reduce electricity prices by $275. Instead, the budget they released, a mere few weeks ago, told the truth and exposed that lie. Far from going down by 18 per cent, which is the percentage of the $275 from that costings document—the poor RepuTex people will never recover from being associated with that piece of Labor Party fraud and propaganda—the reality is that prices are going up by 56 per cent. So there's only a 74 per cent gap in all of that, which is regrettable to the people that trusted the Labor Party not to lie to them in an election campaign. That was a very reasonable thing for the people of Australia to assume. They'll learn their lesson. But, if someone is going to make such a significant commitment to their household budget and say, 'Vote for us. Your power prices will come down by 18 percent,' it's not unreasonable in our democracy for people to believe that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, we're going to have truth-in-advertising laws. This is going to put some people at Labor Party headquarters in a lot of trouble in the future, because, if the Labor Party lies in an election campaign, there'll be a law against it. So I look forward to looking at what significant punitive measures are going to be encapsulated in any legislative framework for a scenario where a major political party makes a promise and then breaks it in such spectacular fashion—and on one of the most significant things that people are concerned about: their household budget.</span>

                  </a>  The wage system in this country is the Labor Party's wage system. The Labor Party introduced it under the Rudd-Gillard government. If things have been a disaster since then, it's the fault of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. They passed the Fair Work Act, and it hasn't changed. If the criticism is of the Fair Work Act, I welcome that criticism of the Rudd-Gillard regime and the awful fair work system that was put in place and has resulted during the last 10 years in such terrible outcomes for workers. Regrettably, the situation today, under this government, has never been worse for workers. As I outlined, there's been a dramatic collapse in real wages, as inflation is more than double the rate of wages growth. So I join on this matter of public importance in condemning the fraud that the Labor Party took the last election and I will hold them to account for that lie at the upcoming one.</span>

I'm not a naturally cynical person, but I do find it really curious that, after a decade in government, those opposite have suddenly realised that communities around Australia are struggling with rising costs and low wages—problems that were, in fact, created by previous government. We saw the increase of childcare costs under their watch. We saw out-of-pocket fees to GPs—and this is just in my electorate—increase by 38 per cent. That is outrageous. We had a government that had wage suppression at the heart of its economic policy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it was the disgrace of those opposite, the very existence of the terrible policies they had in place for a decade, that made me want to run in the first place. We on this side of the House understand that the cost of living is hitting a lot of Australians hard. We always have understood—and those opposite never have—that that's what happens if you don't support working people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is the situation we find ourselves in the consequence of the wasted decade of the previous government—including 22 failed energy policies—but we are also finding ourselves in a situation where we have an illegal war in Ukraine. Australians understand that we didn't create these challenges, but we have been elected to take responsibility for addressing them—and we are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic plan is a direct and deliberate response to the challenges facing our economy, including the cost of living. That is why one of the very first acts of the Albanese government was to successfully argue for the minimum wage to keep pace with inflation, an outcome which helped around 2.8 million Australians. I remember very, very clearly standing beside the now prime minister—in my electorate of Chisholm—when he was asked the question, 'Do you support a wage increase for the lowest paid workers in the country?' And he said, 'Absolutely.' And I remember the way those now sitting opposite treated that comment. They were outraged. They scoffed. They laughed at a man running for prime minister who dared to aspire to have policies so that those doing it hardest in our communities should get some kind of cost-of-living relief. And now they stand here and they dare to put this matter to this House. They dare to be authorities on what it takes to improve the lives of working people, when they have spent a decade destroying our communities. It is shocking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget is focused on responsible cost-of-living measures. We've made child care cheaper. We are expanding paid parental leave, which means we are increasing workforce participation for parents, who most often are mothers who have to stay out of the workforce because there's just not enough support for child care or for leave. We are making medicines cheaper. We are making sure there is more affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great privilege to take the Treasurer into my community to meet with the Ashburton, Ashwood and Chadstone Public Tenants Group and the Ashwood Chadstone community partnership to talk about real ways we can help people on the ground, listening to the expertise of people who've been advocating for change for decades</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that in the next few days we'll be able to get wages moving again as our secure jobs, better pay bill passes both houses of this place. We will always stand by working people and will do whatever we can to make sure that cost-of-living pressures don't hurt our communities. </span>

It is a longstanding tradition of this parliament, not just this House, that changes to the rules through which we are all elected need to be worked through properly, and ideally have the confidence of all members and senators. I see the chair of the joint standing committee, the member for Jagajaga, here. She's been given some significant work to do over the summer break and we, as a parliament, thank her and her colleagues on the committee for that. This is an appropriate course of action for something which carries significant consequences, and so I move that the referral take place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  It's good to be back again talking about the Address-in-Reply and all the wonderful things that have been done by this government since coming to office back in May. We were talking about GPs and the change in distribution priority area for places like Wallan and Whittlesea and other MM 2 areas of McEwen. We started doing this before the election by going to the Senate committee, where we actually had local doctors talk about the problems they were facing—the shortage of GPs and the inability to attract and retain GPs—because of the changes that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments had made over the previous three years. We promised to fix that, and we did. We addressed that straight away to make sure that we could have more doctors and more opportunities for doctors in our country areas. As I said before, it ends the hypocrisy of what is being said by those opposite that we're taking doctors out of regional areas when in actual fact the decisions that we made mean that we can have more doctors in there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem we've had with doctors also has been due to the pandemic, which is nothing unique to us. It's right across the globe and right across the nation. I was sitting there yesterday as we listened to the contrite speech by the former Prime Minister, Treasurer, health minister, Minister for Home Affairs, minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources and, potentially, environment minister—those titles are a bit of a mouthful!—as he claimed that he was the sole reason for getting through the pandemic. I'll say this to the member for Cook: all elections since COVID have shown that in times of need people turn to Labor governments—in South Australia, WA and Queensland and again in Victoria, as well as in May on a federal level. It just goes to show that people know that when they're in trouble they can rely on us to get things done. They can't rely on those opposite, and that's what we had.</span>

Every single day she had to put up with the member for La Trobe and the member for Hume coming down there, while all the time they were hiding the power prices and sitting there saying, 'Power prices will be cheaper under an LNP government', something they've never apologised for. They've never apologised for deliberately hiding this—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ROB MITCHELL:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you. I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Page. He is done. He is cooked, as we say in this day and age. I thank our prepoll warriors: Deb, Wendy, Sasha and Dylan. We had 150 supporters come out on election day, including branch members, unionists and community members. In fact, we even had two members of the Liberal Party. That's how much it meant to people, to get rid of that mess that was the former government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our central support through the state ALP and national ALP: Chris Ford, Nicola Castleman and Jet Fogarty. I thank Young Labor, including a man we call the Stig—he was there; that's young James McDonald—and his dedicated team. They would get up in the morning and letterbox drop, and do everything that needed to be done. Thanks to my friends in the trade union movement, the TWU Vic Tas Branch and the CFMEU. To Muhammad and the AEC team in McEwen: thank you for everything you did. At times it was testing, but they worked hard and delivered a fantastic, clean, open result and kept communication going so well. I also want to thank—this might brighten up the member for Page—the leaders of both major parties for coming to my electorate during the campaign. I say this, particularly, because no matter which leader came I have no doubt it delivered votes to the Labor Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now in the middle of working to build a better future, something Australians can now be proud of—a government that works for them, not for themselves. I am humbled and grateful to the people of McEwen for putting me here again. I'll guarantee the same as I have done at every election: every promise we make, we deliver on. We've done that. Compare that to the record of those opposite. Every promise they've made, they've broken. Now it's up to us to continue cleaning up the mess that we've been left with from the former government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Deputy Speaker, as you know, the address-in-reply is a follow-on from the Governor-General's address when parliament resumes after an election. People start by acknowledging the election campaign, their own team and thanking people as part of that process. I know we've moved a few months on from that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I talk about what I normally would say in my address-in-reply, I want to talk about the event that happened in my community six weeks before the election was called. My community, especially the Lismore region and lower Richmond area, the villages of Coraki, Woodburn, Broadwood and Wardell, was hit by a devastating flood, which was bigger than anything we'd ever seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a river-flat community know floods. We know how to deal with floods. We've seen lots of floods. To give you some reality on the peaks and what we're used to, the two previously recorded floods in Lismore were 12½ metres. The water overtops the levee at about 10½ metres, so you know the water's going to come into the CBD and flood certain areas there. Everyone has their flood plan, whereby they will lift stuff above 12½ metres to be out of the flood area. Most of the houses in north and south Lismore as well, because of historical floods, are built above the 12½ metre level, so they know that while water will go under their houses et cetera they'll be okay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they went to bed that night it was very wet, and everyone was very nervous. The BOM was saying that the flood would peak at 11½ metres. So you had people going to bed saying, 'Okay, it's wet; it's going to flood, and we'll wake up tomorrow and have a clean-up to do.' But they were confident that they were safe. That was at about 11 at night. It was dark. That's stating the obvious. At about one or two o'clock in the morning the BOM revised its peak to 13½ metres and then to 14½ metres. That meant that, during the hours of the night that it was pouring with rain, water started to go into people's houses—and people didn't know it would do that. There were around 2,000 houses, so that's thousands of people whose lives were in danger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Water came into the houses, filling them. People had to clamber onto rooftops and into roof cavities to save their lives. The emergency services weren't expecting this either. The SES had moved people up from Newcastle and other areas to look after the event. There were things that had been done, but there were things that had not been done for this event—no-one knew this was going to happen and no-one had prepared for it. I was up at three or four o'clock in the morning, when I saw the river height adjustment. I saw young people, mainly 18- to 35-year-old men, almost instinctively get into any water vessel they could find, whether it be kayaks, jetskis, boats or tinnies. They just went out and started saving their neighbours' lives—literally saving their lives, with great danger. This wasn't water that was rising slowly; this was a torrential river that was at a great rate of knots, so it was very dangerous for them. Four people died that day, and it was a miracle that only four people died through this event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I myself was getting calls or texts from people saying: 'Kevin, I live at 10 Such-and-such Street. I'm on my roof. I need help.' So I was just sending all these text messages, with their addresses, through to the SES and to the other emergency responders and the first response teams, as were a lot of other people getting those messages. So that was—stating the obvious—a very traumatic night. The water then continued downriver, and the stories for Coraki, Woodburn, Broadwater and Wardell were similar. Again, the tinnie army, as they were dubbed, went out and literally saved our families' and our friends' lives that night and that day, and they will never be able to be thanked enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had the situation where a lot of people were piling almost ad hoc into evacuation centres. There were a couple that opened up in Lismore straightaway—one at the university—and then centres opened in the towns downriver. Again, this was still a crisis situation. We were blocked off—even the major towns of Lismore and Casino were. I mention Casino. They too had hundreds of houses that went underwater, and it's almost not acknowledged, because there were so many other things that happened in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So all these major towns were locked off by floodwater for many, many days, so food was becoming an issue. I had a phone call from a friend of mine who was in the Coraki evacuation centre on about Tuesday—no food. There were 200 or 300 people at this evacuation centre, and they had no food. She said, 'Kevin, I think a riot's going to break out.' So we were all just doing everything we could, with phone calls and getting the private networks that we had around, to make sure that the community survived and had the basics to get through this, as quickly as we could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge the Prime Minister at the time, as well as the Premier, the Deputy Premier, the Deputy Prime Minister and the emergency management ministers. At five o'clock on the Monday morning, when I realised what was going on, I contacted the head of the SES and the head of the 41st Battalion in Lismore, and I said, 'Tell me what the situation is and tell me what you need.' I immediately set up some chat groups and just said, 'We need aerial support from the ADF by lunchtime or people are going to be drowned in their homes,' and that happened by that lunchtime. Then, of course, the ADF arrived as soon as they could on the Thursday, once the floodwaters subsided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was, again, a devastation that we'd never seen. What happened then, once the water did subside, was that people were going back into their houses or their shops. This wasn't just a normal flood where people would wash stuff out. The water was 2½ metres higher than had ever been seen before in our region. It had taken out insulation. It had taken out roofs. It had just destroyed places, including people's homes. Many, many people had only the clothes on their backs. Thousands of people were like that. For days and weeks, I was at the evacuation centres every day, and for quite a while there were literally hundreds of people sleeping in a hall. You might have a family of four there and literally a drug addict there and another family, all just sleeping with each other in a big sports facility such as a basketball court. That created its own challenges. Again, because we were isolated, the community on its own did this. As I said, the ADF couldn't get through till the Thursday. We were cut off from petrol—even the petrol tankers—and the grocery stores were running out of food as well. So it was an amazing effort by the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, obviously, after the water subsided the ADF arrived and the recovery began. I forget how much rubbish there was, but it was hundreds of tonnes. It took six or seven weeks for the rubbish to be collected from the street. So what was happening was that people were literally just throwing their contents off their balconies or verandahs; the ones who had built on stilts were just throwing it out of windows. It took six to eight weeks to collect just from the roadside. People then had nothing in their house. They had nothing except for the clothes on their back, and they were minimal. They went to their houses and literally threw everything out. There were thousands of people with nothing in their houses. Then the recovery began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's going to be a slow recovery. After the event I spoke to a lot of people who have been associated with events like this and they said, 'Kevin, this will take time.' I can see that. We're now eight months on. I think this is going to be a five-year recovery. Thousands of people are still living in caravans or camping in their houses because it is taking many months for the insurance claim process or to get building supplies and/or builders to repair this. To date very few people are back in their houses at the same standard they were eight months ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 1,000 CBD businesses have been damaged. If you walk the streets of Lismore, Woodburn, Wardell, Broadwater and Coraki, you see that, out of every 10 businesses, only two or three have recovered to an extent to be open. Many still aren't open. This is a big journey we're taking together. We'll get there. We are a very resilient community. It's going to be a multi-year journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also waiting for CSIRO to do a flood mitigation study for the whole of the catchment. It has never been done before. That is a $10 million study. They will come back with engineering solutions for flood mitigation. We will have to implement whatever recommendations they make because every government—whether local, state or federal—has to make sure that their people are safe and feel safe in their houses or businesses. That's where the community was at at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, being an MP yourself, you know that in those times as an MP and public leader you are exceptionally busy. There are lots of demands. There were more than usual as we were trying to design grant schemes. Some grant schemes just rolled off the shelf, which was fine, but others had to be designed, given the nature of the event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five or six weeks after this event, while we were still under such stress and trauma, the election was on. I'll just talk about my staff. One staff member's husband lost his business and another staff member's mother's house got flooded. Everyone was either directly or vicariously traumatised by this, including my staff. Five or six weeks after this the election was called. We were under immense pressure. Our office was flooded as well. We were in temporary accommodation. I literally said to one of my staff members, 'You go and look after the election because we're too busy.' We just had to maintain doing the job we had to do, given the state our community was in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time like that we really couldn't focus a lot on the election. We had one staff member devoted to that while we were doing our job for our community, who were undergoing a very stressful situation. I'm very grateful that, in the election, my community re-elected me with an increased margin. It was a very humbling experience, given the conditions and what was going on for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the Lismore local government area, the lower Richmond local government area and Casino need to go forward. For the duration of this parliament, the next three years, my focus as the MP—and I've worked with the new government; I acknowledge the new government have announced a number of programs since they were elected—is on the recovery. It's about getting people back into their homes. It's about getting people back into their businesses. We will do that. During the election we said that we'd take one day at a time and we will get back into our homes and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very positive. I think our journey is going to be a long one, as I said. I'm very positive that with the recovery, the rebuild and the flood mitigation we will do when CSIRO reports its findings that our community will be safer than it was before. We are a beautiful area and we are a wonderful community. We will get back to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Besides the recovery, there are some projects I'm really excited about. There are lots of grants out there—farming grants, small business grants and grants to help people get back in their homes. We announced a house-raising, land-swap and buyback program. Again I acknowledge that the new government went halves with the state government in that program that was announced just a month or so ago. I acknowledge the Prime Minister was there that day to announce that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a major focus, but in a different light, some of the electorate isn't as badly affected by this, so there are a lot of positive things happening. Within Lismore itself we're doing a major upgrade of Oakes and Crozier oval. There are going to be some really exciting developments that are done, besides the recovery. One I'm very excited about is a rail trail. We live in a beautiful region, the north coast of New South Wales. There are going to be some great developments made like that, and eventually that will hopefully go from Casino all the way through my electorate, down the hill into Byron Bay and then up the hill on the other side all the way to Murwillumbah. I honestly believe that will be a global drawcard, the rail trail, and there has been some money has been announced for that. The build for that has starting at both ends, so I'm very excited about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the region of Kyogle, a wonderful part of the world as well, we've done a massive bridge renewal program, a program that was announced by the new government back in 2013. It has been a great program. We've done a lot of work with Kyogle on that, and I look forward to working with them on that. In Casino we're doing some wonderful upgrades of the swimming pool and also the showground. We've upgraded the saleyards. It now has the second highest turnover of cattle in the state. That's a wonderful asset, and we'll be doing more work in regions like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going further south to Grafton—wonderful. If you've never been to the Clarence Valley, go there. It includes Grafton, being the capital of the Clarence Valley. You go downriver to places like Maclean, and then on the coast you've got places like Yamba and Iluka and some very exciting things happening there. There's the riverside precinct upgrade and a lot of other things we've announced over the years that will be built there as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further south we go onto the northern beaches of Coffs Harbour. I actually have sought leave on Saturday morning. Sorry, team; I'm hoping I won't be there on Saturday morning. I acknowledge the member for Cowper behind me too, who had input into this. We're opening a $24 million sporting facility there that we announced a year or so ago, so there are great things happening down on the northern beaches as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is, as we moved into opposition, I acknowledged the Australian public's decision. They say the Australian public never gets it wrong, so we obviously now as opposition reflect on that. We reflect on the things that we did. We reflect on the good things and the good government that we were, but we also reflect on how we need to improve or why we didn't win overall. So we will do that, and we will hold the new government to account. As an Australian citizen—forget the fact that you're an MP—you always want the government of the day to do well, because if that government of the day is doing well, our economy and our country are doing well. But we as an opposition should politely, sometimes maybe not as politely as we should, hold this new government to account, and we will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will note that one of the things that I'm very proud of, having been a member of the previous government, is the unemployment rate we handed over to the new government. We handed over an economy that I think was the envy of a lot of the world. We'd been through a lot of challenges through COVID and other things, but when we handed over the reins to the new government, the economy was exceptionally strong. The unemployment rate was at a low that hadn't been seen since the early 1970s. We, through COVID fatalities and through any other measurement that you want to look at, had done quite well. That was obviously with the assistance of the Public Service, and I acknowledge them and the assistance we had from the health authorities and our nurses and primary care workers, who did amazing work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we live in a world that has some strategic geopolitical challenges. I do acknowledge the new government. As shadow trade and tourism minister I think that some of the things they've been doing there have been very positive, and I acknowledge them—also on some of the foreign affairs issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will say that I think the new government has in some ways broken faith with the public. I think one of the major ways they broke faith with the public is the IR laws. I have run my own small business and talk to many small businesses, and with all due respect to the new government, you never, ever said you were going to do what you did. You never went to the public and said you were going to bring in the multisector and multilevel bargaining that you have. In fact, you could say that one certain minister misled when he was asked that question. He's now trying to deny that. We will hold you to account. It's our job to hold you to account. We want the unemployment rate to stay low. We want our small businesses to be prosperous. We want our children to have a better future than us and better prospects than us. I think with these IR laws you are putting some of that at risk. I think you're sending us back to the 1970s with these IR laws. You're changing back some of the changes that Hawke and Keating made. On that level, we will hold you to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also personally very disappointed about the cashless welfare card abolition. I grew up near and have spent time in one of the communities that had that card. We talk about closing the gap. I firmly believe that the abolition of that card is placing women and children at great risk. I personally believe that alcohol fuelled violence is going to increase in those communities. I think the ideological obsession the now government has about personal liberties might sound all well and good in an elite, high-level, academic-type discussion, but that means nothing to the women and children who are now in personal danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, I congratulate the new government. I do, in my own way, wish them well for the benefit of the Australian people. I'll say to my electorate: our journey is long, but we'll do it together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  This is my sixth term in this place, and it's an honour and privilege to represent the people and communities that comprise the electorate of Blair. I have to say that the previous government was unlike any other government I've experienced, and the previous term was unlike any other. We had lockdowns, wearing masks, attending parliament virtually, working from home, travel restrictions and border passes—you name it. It was unlike anything I have previously experienced. Sadly, droughts, bushfires and floods are what we have previously experienced and, sadly, that experience was in my electorate. Troops were returning from Afghanistan. We have had people struggling to find or afford a home in which to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the highlight, apart from increasing my margin in a marginal seat, was seeing Labor returned to government after nine years in opposition. The 2022 election was a significant event in Labor's history. I want to thank the people of Blair for putting their faith in me to continue to represent them in our federal parliament. Blair is one of the fastest growing regions in the country, and we need to invest in the jobs and infrastructure of the future. It's a future that's coming very quickly in terms of the needs of our area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election of the Labor government will deliver more than $82 million in local commitments to the western corridor. It's called the western corridor because it is west of Brisbane. This includes a number of initiatives for the booming greater Springfield area that will deliver Blair, together with the electorate of my neighbour the member for Oxley and the Speaker, $12.6 million for the Springfield BioPark to advance medical manufacturing. That will support up to 1,100 jobs in the Ipswich and Springfield region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $3.5 million for a new Indian cultural centre. We don't have one in South-East Queensland. There is an Indian cultural centre in most capital cities in the country, but there's not one in Queensland. There will be one located in Springfield. I want to thank Jim Varghese, the Indian community and so many people who made that possible. There's $3.4 million for the Ipswich-to-Springfield rail line business case. This has been asked for by the Ipswich City Council. It has been committed to in the budget. This will be important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend—and I must congratulate the Melbourne Demons—the Brisbane Lions AFLW team tragically lost. But it was a great day anyway because we opened the new stadium, the Brighton Homes Arena, in Springfield. But we saw the challenges of roads being unfinished and pedestrian management issues. We saw the fact that we really need that rail link to be extended from Springfield out through Redbank Plains, to Ripley, to Yamanto and then back to Ipswich—an alternative spur. That would be critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that area, Springfield Central State School will be provided $100,000 to upgrade their facilities. The playground area for the prep students is very old, and it's a very small area. That money will be provided, and it's being provided in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These commitments build on a range of transport and community infrastructure projects that we have committed to across Ipswich, Somerset and the Karana Downs area. They include $20 million to update the North Ipswich stadium—we call it the North Ipswich Reserve in Ipswich—which will potentially allow us to host NRL and A-League matches in the future. The A-League, in my view, wrongly decided not to grant the licence to the Western Pride some years ago. We got to the penultimate round but fell short and, sadly, the Brisbane Jets' bid for the NRL licence was rejected in favour of the Dolphins' bid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the criticisms of the bid that was made was the fact that we didn't have a proper stadium. I think this $20 million will go a long way towards kickstarting that. The Ipswich City Council has previously said they will put in $10 million and I've called publicly for the council to put that $10 million towards it. I call on the Queensland Labor government to kick in some money as well, particularly with the Olympics coming up in the next decade. It would be a big boon for Ipswich to have an AFL stadium in the east and, in Springfield Central, a proper stadium that would be akin to Dolphin oval or, indeed, Parramatta stadium. That would be a big boon for football in Ipswich—and not just football, which we called soccer in my childhood; rugby league and rugby union could also be played at that particular stadium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also committed $4 million to the Ipswich Showgrounds. This is absolutely critical, because the showgrounds are the main evacuation site for people in Ipswich and surrounds, and we saw the inadequacy of the ablutions block there. There weren't enough showers. There weren't enough toilets. Hundreds of people can stay at that particular site in any given flood situation. Tragically and very sadly, during my period of time in parliament and in my lifetime, we've had four major floods in Ipswich, which have impacted adversely not just the property of the people of Ipswich but their lives and their mental health. We've also had loss of life in our region. Of that $4 million, $1.5 million will be used for that purpose. It comes under the money that we're providing in the Disaster Ready Fund, and I thank the minister, Senator Watt, for that particular commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $10 million for the planning stage of the final section of the Ipswich Motorway. That's the section from the Centenary interchange through to the Oxley roundabout. The Queensland government wants money for that, and we're providing additional funds in this budget for that. That's the final stage. One hundred thousand vehicles a day go through that section of the Ipswich Motorway. It's the final, missing leg that needs to be done. The Queensland government wants to do it, and we're putting money in the budget for the planning stage of that. It's really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $2 million for a community sports hub. The biggest high school in my electorate is Ipswich State High School. I want to congratulate Ipswich State High, as I have done before, for being undefeated. Their senior boys team won three cups this year. They actually won the NRL cup as well, beating a Sydney based team. That's not easy. I can tell you that it's always great when a Queensland team beats a New South Wales team at any sport—particularly in rugby league. It's great that they were undefeated. I congratulate nine of their team for getting NRL contracts as a result of the work that they did. Congratulations, Ipswich State High.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're putting $2 million towards a community sports hub there. That'll provide additional basketball courts. Basketball is a booming sport in Ipswich. It has seen growth of 50 per cent in the last 18 months. That funding will be important for Ipswich State High. The Queensland government will bring forward decisions in relation to that sports hub and that sports hall. There are other sports that will benefit from that. Volleyball, futsal and other sports will also be able to use it. These are sports that are often neglected in terms of their attention and their funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of other schools in the local area will get funding. Just across the road from Ipswich State High is Brassall State School, which will get $60,000 for a new prep-safe playground. Honestly, at the moment, their playground looks like it was built when I was a child; it's so old. There's also $15,000 for upgrading an audiovisual system for Karalee State School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important things in terms of flood recovery and resilience in my area is the money we're providing under the urban rivers program. That's $3 million that will help in terms of flood resilience and improving water quality and environmental values. We don't even have rain gauges or water gauges in some of our creeks. Unfortunately, there's riparian repair required in those areas. That is a very, very important commitment that we're making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been campaigning for the $5 million for the veterans hub for years. The previous government's candidate, back in 2016, made a commitment for a veterans hub and failed to carry it out. I wrote to then minister Dan Tehan about it after the election. They said, 'You're not going to get it.' In 2019, we committed to seven veterans hubs. The coalition committed to six and deliberately missed out Ipswich. We're going to deliver one. Even during the last election, they couldn't commit themselves to a veterans hub in Ipswich. So we're doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Medicare urgent care clinic to take pressure off Ipswich Hospital is really important as well. And I'm looking forward to the new Head to Health mental health centre, which will be based in Ipswich. There'll be a spur up in Kingaroy. But that's really, really important. There's $2.5 million for the Kambu Health service for our local Indigenous community. Many years ago, I got $1 million for the Children and Family Centre to be located there. They cater for about 12,500 patients, but they need more rooms. Kambu Health service really does almighty work. They're going to relocate the Children and Family Centre out to Amaroo, which is near Silkstone State School. They've got a prep area and a kindy area not far from Silkstone State School. That will make a difference. There's $1 million for the upgrade of the facilities at the fast-growing Ripley Valley Football Club and $500,000 for Ipswich hockey, including irrigation and lighting, and $20,000 for a new toy library in the Redbank Plains community centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this term of parliament, I'm going to work as hard as I can to make sure we progress the business case for the Cunningham Highway and the Amberley Road interchange upgrade. I know the member for Riverina was involved, when he was the minister for infrastructure, in the $170 million. There was bipartisan support for that, by the way. The business case is now being done with the federal and state government. There's been a bipartisan approach to that particular upgrade. It's needed from a federal government point of view. I think the state government made a terrible mistake in taking it off its priority list. They've now put it back on, which is a good initiative. They finally saw the need for it. The RAAF base at Amberley is located there, and 5,500 people work at the RAAF base at Amberley. We've got to get the infrastructure right in that area. I'll be working as hard as I can to make sure that happens. It helps my electorate. It also helps the member for Wright, who's sitting over there. It helps his constituents because they go through that interchange all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the Mount Crosby Road interchange. There's a business case being developed by the Queensland government with federal and state government money. That, of course, has been bipartisan as well, with funding from the previous government, and we have committed to continue that process. So there are those two important interchanges—one on the south side of Ipswich at Amberley and one on the north side at Mount Crosby. This is very important for my constituents, and I want to see real solutions in this term of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank a lot of people, too. I want to thank the people of Blair, as I've said, for the work they have done. I'm very pleased that this government has taken up the commitments I made as the shadow minister for veterans affairs and for supporting so many initiatives that I announced during the federal campaign. I pay tribute to the tenacity and bravery of advocates for taking action on veterans health and veterans suicide, like Julie-Ann Finney, Karen Bird and Nikki Jamieson. The bravery and commitment they've shown to our veterans and their families is exemplary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of people I want to thank. I want to thank the traditional owners of my area, the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul people, and pay my respects for the work that they do and thank them for their tens of thousands of caring for country in my area. First Nations people comprise five per cent of the population in Ipswich, higher than the Queensland average of 4.6 per cent and the Australian average of 3.2 per cent. I'm proud to be part of a government that's committed to due recognition of treaty and truth and voice for our First Nations people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the branches and the unions who supported me, and the local residents and community activists who supported me on the ground. I want to thank Julie-Ann Campbell, the former state secretary of the party in Queensland and Zac Beers, our assistant secretary, and I want to thank the new state secretary, Kate Flanders, for her ongoing support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Queensland results don't reflect the great support and direction that we took at the state level, but that's politics for you. I want to thank a number of Queensland party organisers—Mitchell, Isaac, Izzy and Luke—for their work on the ground and behind the scenes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the unions as well. I particularly thank my union. I've been a member of the Services Union for a very, very long time. Thank you to Jen Thomas and Neil Henderson for their ongoing support and to all those members who came out to stand out on booths in the pouring rain in Springfield Central, like Justine, Rebecca, John and Jack. I thank the plumbers union, who've provided incredible assistance over a number of years to me. Thanks, Tom, Rian, Michael, Justin, Luke and all of the plumbers who did letterboxing, put up signs and worked in prepoll and on election day. Thanks to the TWU and especially Justin out at Tarampa and Lachy, who came up from the Gold Coast with his partner to work all day in a polling booth. Thanks to the Shoppies, the AWU and the meatworkers union in Queensland. The only union I've been a member of apart from the Services Union is the meatworkers union, and I think I might still have my 1979 meatworkers union ticket in the back of a drawer somewhere. There are hundreds of branch members across Blair, and I want to thank them all. They were the backbone of the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the local branches from Somerset to the Springfield area. I want to thank my campaign director, Madonna Oliver, for her relentless work ethic, her wise guidance and her strong leadership. Blair has over 50 booths, and Madonna told me in the lead-up to the election, 'We'll have the best booth roster ever.' COVID tore through the electorate, and there was also a pretty nasty impact from flu across our people on election day. Thanks to the volunteers—so many of them. I want to thank Madonna's husband, Glen, a retired Army warrant officer who provided great insights into veterans issues and practical support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Chris Forrester, my former office manager and my mate. He's been a friend of mine for many, many years, and I appreciate the work and the guidance. We adopted what I've described as the Forrester strategy to get re-elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to Nick Hughes and Janice Cumming, the treasurer and the secretary of the Blair federal electoral council, who ensured the t's were crossed and the i's were dotted. Thanks to Ian Fraser, who became the high-vis master, ensuring that teams of people were standing on street corners, engaging traffic and passers-by, from August 2021. He was ably supported by a group of people who call themselves the 'cartel' and who promoted the member for Oxley and me: Neil Bennett, Vince Atley and Martin Grandelis, with the incredible support of Neil's wife, Judy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to Peter Duffy, Pye Augustine, Rob Cox, Paul Whewell and so many others. I want to acknowledge Nayda Hernandez, who provided tremendous assistance in engaging the diverse cultures across Blair and Oxley, as well as providing additional volunteers from among her family and friends. A big thank you to Cate Oliver and Nicole Chapple, who are known as the prepoll whisperers. Together with Rhonda Nolan, they built on the great work of Peter Duffy in getting the booth rosters together. Thanks to Michael Watkins, who worked with Ian Cavanagh, Michael Pattemore, Tyler Brennan and many others to get signs up across the electorate. Michael Watkins transformed a ute into a mobile billboard and became a regular troubleshooter in the campaign</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the Ipswich Trades Hall crew, including Ipswich Councillor Jacob Madsen and Cameron Jeppesen. They transformed the spiritual home of the Labor Party and the labour movement in Ipswich into a staging place, and of course there was an amazing election night party there. I want to thank the branch members across the area. I particularly want to thank the state members Charis Mullen, Lance McCallum, Jen Howard and Jim Madden for the work they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the volunteer base. I want to thank people in Toogoolawah like Beryce Nelson, who used to be a member of the other side of politics. She helped me out a bit. The Toogoolawah booth was staffed entirely by community members—people like Charlie and Jade Lewis, along with people like Carolyn Barker. Thanks to Arthur Needham in Karana Downs, Geoff Beattie in Glamorgan Vale, David and Jackie Martin in Ipswich, and all the regular and first-time volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big thanks to Clair Parsons, who kept the electorate office going, served on the campaign team and liaised with party officers on so many issues. During COVID, Clair ensured my office made tens of thousands of calls to constituents while keeping the administrative things running effectively. Staff member Chris Condon provided exceptional advice and assistance in veterans affairs issues, and I'm pleased he's staying on in the office and providing policy, communications and constituent support. Janice Cumming is the face of the office to constituents and very much loved in the electorate. I think if she ran she'd probably get 99 per cent of the vote. Thanks to my casual staff over the last few years, including Grace Forrester, Shonna Lye—congratulations, Shonna, on the job you got with Mark Dreyfus, the Attorney-General—Laura Ketter, Terry Kent and Ed Uzelin.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big thanks to all in my family for their support. My wife, Carolyn, has been a great support and has endured a relationship with me since 1983. Despite her own health battles, she has provided ongoing family support. We are now empty nesters. I am glad that I have raised two daughters, Alex and Jacqui, who are Christians, feminists and Labor Party members. My wife and I have begun a new adventure being first-time grandparents following the birth of our grandson, Joshua, to my daughter Jacqui and her husband, Andrew.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my brothers Regan and Darrin and my friends and confidantes together with Darrin's wife, Claire, and their son, Will, who provided great support in Kilcoy and Mount Kilcoy. LNP members know my family very well and always treat them well on election day. The LNP and Labor people up in those country areas always get on very well—even though they are a bit mistaken on the other side!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big thanks to my mum, Joy Butler, and her husband, Rob, for their ongoing support and home cooking. My mum is like the godmother of the Labor Party in Ipswich. I'm sure the Speaker will testify to the truth of that. Her cooking is amazing, she is fantastic and we love her dearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to thank my colleagues, particularly those shadow ministers who visited my electorate and my colleagues with whom I spend so much time in Canberra. More than my colleagues, they are my friends who share similar values and desire for a better future for our constituents and for the nation, who believe in social justice, equality of opportunity and a fair go for all. That is what I believed in all my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remain energetic, enthusiastic and excited about representing the people of Blair for another three years. I look forward to the coming term and getting much needed projects I've referred to going and continuing to work hard to fight for a better future for our community, because we certainly need it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  As the member for Blair leaves the chamber, I acknowledge his contribution, particularly his opening remarks where he said this is his sixth term that he has served in this place, a feat to be acknowledged. I stand now to give my address in reply, having served five. Among the members in the House and at the dispatch box, I see a former Deputy Prime Minister. I draw on the member for Blair's comments around the infrastructure that we committed funding to on the Cunningham Highway. I acknowledge the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Riverina, because it was him who found that money after a conversation he had with some personnel. He said, 'If there was one thing I could do for you as the Deputy Prime Minister, what would you like? The overwhelming response to you from those personnel was, 'Get us home safe because it is a death trap.' I was the assistant minister and—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr McCormack:</span>
                  </a>  And a good assistant minister!</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230531" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUCHHOLZ:</span>
                  </a>  For the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, the Deputy Prime Minister said I was a good assistant minister—clearly not too good because I'm sitting on the backbench now! Regardless, his advocacy in that place was exceptional. The way he moved was at the speed of a thousand gazelles, and the member for Blair was a lone voice in the Labor ranks supporting that. There weren't even costings done. The former Deputy Prime Minister rang the state government and asked them how much it was. He said, 'Here is 50 per cent of the money; let's get on and build this project. This is a project the community is wanting and one the community is advocating for, start work.' I have never seen more state Labor ministers jump over couches and run out the back to try and hide so they did not have to commit their 50 per cent to it. For the record, the member for Blair did and he was steadfast, and I look forward to that project being committed under his stewardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The address-in-reply speech is an opportunity to acknowledge those magnificent people who helped put us here for my fifth term. More recently, to put it into perspective, I don't want to get into the trap of naming names but more recently we had a volunteer thank you function. We do it a little bit differently in the bush. We have live bands and Santa Claus comes and the parcels are handed out. We put on a complimentary barbecue and drinks. When we added the amount of membership we had in the electorate of Wright, the LNP membership, to the number of volunteers who lent a hand at some 80 booths across the electorate and then added on a handful of people who helped fund our campaign from the region, because a lot of the money that comes from our campaign comes from interstate, we had an invitation list to that function north of 900 people. It was humbling to have so many people committed to a cause that they believe in—that generations of families have believed in. To be able to serve as their federal member in this place is a privilege that keeps me humbled every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Occasionally, I have the opportunity to walk up to the parliament, when the weather is fine. I'll be on the phone to Christine and I'll say to her, 'I never fail to be moved by the significance of this building, Australian Parliament House, the most visited place in Australia.' Particularly when the flags are flying, the sense of patriotism and privilege I feel at being able to work in this place causes the hairs on my forearm to stand up. I say to Christine, 'It's bizarre, because I feel this every day I walk up,' and she says, 'The day you stop feeling that is the day that you should offer your resignation.' I think I have a lot more to contribute to our electorate. I have a lot more to contribute to the LNP in Queensland and a lot more to contribute to the Liberal Party of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, I want to share with the House the difficulties my electorate has gone through, during my terms, from weather events. We had extreme drought. I was very proud during the last term to secure many millions of dollars to co-fund our growers when they believed they were being incorrectly charged for water because of their water meters. The capital equipment was corroded, so the process was to estimate their water usage charges. The growers were complaining that water charges were out of control. A group of growers got together and had the great idea to change those water meters to modern-day telematic water meters that could be read via satellite, with the reading being sent back to a central location. We did that, and it has made an incredible difference in charges to those growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my area the largest contributor to GDP is agriculture, and horticulture is the largest component of that. Madam Deputy Speaker, I'll give you a sense as to why some vegetables are so expensive at the moment. It's an accumulation of cost as a result of adverse weather events. I want to run you through what the last decade has looked like for some growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 years we've had drought and six significant floods. In some, lives have been lost, and we've never found the bodies. Growers all grow their product on the flood plain, and the reason it's called a flood plain is that it floods. A grower will put in a number of acres of a product. Depending on what seed material they use, they outsource to a company and put an order in for seedlings. The seedlings take six weeks to germinate and arrive on a truck, on average, so they've got to plan it out that far in advance. The seedlings arrive and the growers have got that cost, but they don't have any capacity to pay for those seedlings until they sell them. They put the seedlings into the ground and they incur the cost of the labour component. They water and fertilise them, and both things have a cost element. They tend to the paddock. And it just seems that every time they get within two seconds of harvesting, a rain event comes. The paddock is destroyed to the point where laser levelling needs to be done to return soil that's many kilometres down the road back to the paddock. Once that process happens and they rehabilitate the soil, they're back on the phone to the seedling operator saying, 'Can I have another paddock of seedlings?' The operator comes again, and, once you have repeated that process some four or five times, you have the mental stress, the financial hardship and the pain of these communities trying to manage. On top of that are the labour shortages that we've had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the new Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in the House earlier on. One of the beauties of when we were in government was the establishment of the Pacific Islanders work scheme. Whilst all and sundry say it's a great scheme, there are some failings with it. We found that those communities in the horticultural sector were limited because, when they flew workers into their community, they were unable to transfer that workforce to anywhere other than to their own farm. That meant that when a farm was in the period of hiatus that I spoke of earlier because their farm had been washed away and the farm down the road needed labour, we had Pacific Islanders that we couldn't outsource to reduce the farmer's cost. That's an area for government to look at, and I will contact the minister to pursue that on behalf of my growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to speak about the state of the economy, particularly over the past decade with the strength of our economy when we left government. I gave a speech about this some weeks ago. When we left office, the unemployment rate started with a three, our economy was strong and we were the envy of the OECD nations. That was not in dispute. Female participation in the workforce was as high as it had ever been in history. We remember the footage of the unemployment queues during COVID—they were outside the Centrelink offices, down the road, around the corner. People were sitting on milk crates waiting to be processed. We introduced JobKeeper, which saved many hundreds of thousands of businesses. When I walk through my electorate, I'm still reminded by businesses that without our government those businesses would not have got through COVID. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the architects of our government's policy for preparing those packages. Our country got through COVID on the back of some of those policy positions. Each time we needed more money to support those businesses, we brought it back to the parliament and we put it to a vote. On every occasion those on the other side supported the funding package. I think it's ironic when they stand up and say they've inherited $1 trillion worth of debt. The irony is that when we said we needed to pull it up and start weaning people off JobKeeper, there was an outcry from those on the other side. The comments were that the economy would fall of a cliff if we didn't continue with those payments. You can't say we've left you $1 trillion in debt, but each time we brought the provisions in the House you supported them and wanted them to go further. It insults the intelligence of the Australian public when those on the other side of the House try to have a bet each way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about $1 trillion worth of debt. I remember when I was in opposition when I was first elected, and the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments were in power. They introduced a thing called the mining tax to raise $270 million. Labor went off and spent their $270 million on the expectation that this was going to be a great windfall. They borrowed the money, put the $270 million on the ticket, and do you remember what the mining tax actually raised? It raised next to nothing, but we still carried the debt. We inherited debt from Labor, which was about half a trillion dollars, and we stacked the other one up to save the economy. We make no apology for saving the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time we heard a list from the Treasurer about things that are going to be free as a result of Labor's office. That's wonderful for the people who are going to be receiving the free stuff. But, as a Prime Minister once said, 'When it's free, that just means that somebody else is paying for it.' Somebody else is going to be paying for that and it's going to be the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank my family for the work that they have done. When I started this journey, I was married. I'm not going to say that the reason for that marriage failure was my place here, but I acknowledge Lynn—she started the journey with me, and I wish her well. My partner now, Christine, is an amazing strength, with her children a part of our life. It is something beautiful to have a support team around you that is dexterous and attends functions. It is noteworthy. I thank Christine so much for her unquestionable support. I shared the story earlier in my speech about walking up to the house, and her commenting that when I no longer feel moved in this place I should give it away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think an address-in-reply speech is one that is best delivered for the benefit of our membership and those people who helped us get here. I don't want to mention names, but if I can close off my contribution tonight by thanking our SECs, or state electoral councils, and FDCs in our party world. Each of those has executives. Because of the size of my electorate I have about seven of those. They are the branches that sit under those 900 volunteers that I have in membership and the volunteers who may not be a member of the party. Without them it would be an impossible task, particularly if we had to remunerate members. They stand in the rain and they stand in the sun—they stand there for many hours during the course of the day because they believe in a coalition, they believe in the fundamentals of conservatism, and they believe in the values that we have as a party. They will stand there and give their time to try to prevent us losing government. To everyone who did that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity to thank you in advance for the work that you will do at the next election and, hopefully, the election after that. Without you our community is poorer. Know that I will work every day as hard as I can to provide the funding for my electorate—which I have. I will provide the administrative support to our service organisations in assisting with printing. I will provide the moral support and support that we give with our RSLs and supporting organisations. I will support our state members—from the Gold Coast, Ros Bates, from Scenic Rim, Jon Krause, from Lockyer Valley, Jim McDonald, and the others surrounding. They are the LNP members who are fully elected within my boundaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local government representatives who go about their day and give their time freely—I thank them for the relationships I have with each of them. It makes it so much easier when we go into a community and we can tap into that long-term corporate knowledge that exists in those communities. Flanked by state and local government representatives, my job is made so much easier. My job here in Canberra is to represent those communities and those people to ensure that they are as effective as they possibly can be in representing the best interests of Wright.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my chief of staff, Josh Christian, Drew Creighton, Alice Warby—who has been with me since day one, as has Jo Dempsey, my PA. I think that's evidence of the way that we operate in the electorate, to have staff with me for that period. To Rochelle Maloney, who has just finished up, and a series of other staff that have served in our office: I thank you for the many hours over and above what the provisions would have paid you for, and for the exemplary way that you've gone about your business. I'd encourage you in your new chapters of life, after working in our office, and I hope it has prepared you well for the commercial world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Mini</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ster for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  It is such a privilege to be here in this House this evening, representing the electorate of Brand, as it has been, of course, since I was elected in July 2016. Although the federal election this year was almost six months ago, there are an enormous number of people I need to thank for their help during the campaign and for the help and support they continue to give me as a member in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election earlier this year was the third federal election for which I have stood, and I was enormously pleased and proud to have the overwhelming support of the people of the city of Kwinana and the city of Rockingham. I will continue to represent them, as I have since 2 July 2016, and I thank the whole community for the trust they have placed in me, to be their representative in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my husband, Jamie, who's actually here today—he's the lone person in the gallery! Congratulations! It's a rare thing that people sit around at this time of night watching us. But thanks, Jamie, for your constant love and support—emotional support and very practical support: the kind of support that involves building 500 yard-signs in an evening after a hard day of campaigning during the election. Thanks for always being there for me, for now nearly 23 years, and for wrangling our little friends, Tim, David, Bennie, Ziggy and our old mate Blue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MADELEINE KING:</span>
                  </a>  No. I don't have children; I have dogs. Blue was an 18-year-old poodle-cross that campaigned with us through two campaigns. He was a great campaign dog. Sadly, we said goodbye to him forever last month—good old Blue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though the pandemic produced many challenges, team Brand rose to the challenge of helping to elect an Albanese Labor government. I say to all those branch members who selflessly gave up their time, to our local community organisations and to the various volunteers who turned up and made tireless efforts on the pre-poll booths: I appreciate all that you did for me and for the Labor Party once again. And I want to acknowledge some of the difficulties on the pre-poll—not from our main competitors, the Liberal Party, but from other, minor parties that were terribly badly behaved on the pre-polls. I do thank the members of my party, the Labor Party, but also our friends in the Liberal Party, who were all very decent and ran a fine campaign—obviously, mine was better!—and were very collegial. But some of the other actors in the campaign were just terrible. So thanks to all those who withstood some of those behaviours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the wonderful team in my electorate office who joined volunteers at the 6 am train-station handouts, the after-work mobile offices and the early morning market stalls: I want to thank you. I could not have run in this campaign without you and the amazing effort you all put in. We had a wonderful result in Brand—a significant increase in support. I want to thank the wonderful team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank, for their support, the WA state members; the Premier, Mark McGowan; the Deputy Premier, Roger Cook; the Minister for Police, Paul Papalia; and the Minister for the Environment, Reece Whitby, whose seats all make up the seat of Brand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to mention our new campaign dogs, Ziggy and Bennie, and all the other office dogs that made our lives a bit more fun during tense times: Layla, Muddy and Wombat. Sadly, Muddy has now left us forever, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But into our team we did welcome a new human member: little Benjamin, the newborn son of my chief of staff, Laurence, and his wife, who is also the WA Labor President. So we welcome Benjamin to team Brand. Obviously his membership details will be ready to go and imprinted on him as soon as is possible! I think he's not yet at the age for membership, but we can wait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the election, Western Australians demonstrated very clearly their support for an Albanese Labor government. In addition to holding Brand, Fremantle, Burt and Cowan with increased majorities, Labor won four more seats in the House and one additional Labor senator—and it was nearly five extra seats in the House. I've been enjoying working with my new WA colleagues, who bring unique backgrounds and experiences to our very strong team. The Western Australian people made it very clear: they wanted a federal government that would listen to them and work cooperatively with their state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WA voters had had enough of the tiresome attacks from Clive Palmer, from former senior cabinet ministers and from the former Prime Minister of the former Liberal-National government. Calling Western Australians 'cave people' and comparing the state that is responsible for the underlying strength of the Australian economy to the 'hermit kingdom of North Korea' was deeply insulting and entirely unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When governments change, people lose jobs. It is the toughest part of this contest of elections. I acknowledge those dedicated electorate officers across the seats of Curtin, Hasluck, Pearce, Tangney and Swan, who served their communities during the terms of the former members. I would like to acknowledge the public service of those former members, Celia Hammond, Christian Porter, Ken Wyatt, Ben Morton and Steve Irons. Each of these MPs served their electorates in the state of Western Australia in various capacities, as cabinet ministers, chairs, members of parliamentary committees, members of their party and local members of the House of Representatives. They each deserve appreciation for their work and public service over many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate the new Labor member for Pearce, Tracey Roberts. The member has always been a strong advocate for her community, sitting on the Wanneroo City Council since 2003 and as mayor of the city for 10 years. As president of the WA Local Government Association, she helped elected officials better understand their communities. I know Tracey will serve her constituents well, and I look forward to seeing her continue her advocacy in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the new member for Tangney, Sam Lim. The member for Tangney has done it all and seen it all. He grew up in Malaysia in poverty and strained circumstances. With the love and support of his family, he worked hard to become a police constable in the Royal Malaysia Police before leaving to become a dolphin trainer. He then moved to WA, joined the WA Police Academy and went on to win police officer of the year for his work in diverse communities during the height of COVID. He has secured a better future for his family in moving to Australia, and it demonstrates how much we have to learn from our magnificent and generous migrant community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the new member for Swan, Zaneta Mascarenhas, an engineer, mum of two young kids and now an MP. The member is from Kambalda and her father was a nickel miner—the nickel that ends up in the Nickel West refinery in Kwinana, in my electorate. Like many others from our state, she wears her steel capped boots with pride and has spent much of her professional life working in the resources sector. She spent the last 12 years working with industry to develop practices to lower emissions and, in doing so, saw firsthand the need for leadership and genuine climate change policies at a federal level. I know she will bring a great understanding of her constituency to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the new member for Hasluck, Tania Lawrence. She has lived in Mundaring for 10 years, in the heart of her electorate. Her years of experience in policy, governance and negotiation in the public and private sectors will make her a very effective member of parliament. She understands her constituents' challenges, and we are already seeing her valuable contribution in this area and many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to welcome Labor's third senator from WA, Fatima Payman. Senator Payman's story is an amazing one. Her father is from Afghanistan and, as a refugee, spent time in immigration detention before eventually moving the rest of his family, including Fatima, to Australia. When they first arrived, he worked around the clock as a kitchen hand, a security guard and a taxidriver. He instilled in her the values of hard work and perseverance, and she now represents hardworking people like her dad and other hardworking Australians who are doing all they can to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the first Labor member to be elected to the South Australia seat of Boothby for 73 years, Louise Miller-Frost. Louise has devoted her entire working life to making a difference in people's lives. As the member for Boothby, she is working to ensure that her constituents never experience the financial hardships that her grandparents suffered. I will resume my comments at a later hour.</span>
              </p>

What I think is the better option is that we work on the basis that the bells will ring at 8 am tomorrow, and if the Senate, for some reason, just continues debating or doesn't get through it, then we will communicate a change of arrangements through the whips and directly to the crossbench. That's the explanation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For members: for complete clarity, we will suspend in a moment but not adjourn. In suspending, it will be with the intention that the bells will ring at 8 am tomorrow, and the only item on the agenda will be the message from the Senate that we will deal with. Traditionally it has not been a long debate, but my capacity to predict the length of debates this week has not been great. It's reasonable to presume that it won't be a long period in which we will be dealing with things tomorrow. I think that explains everything for members. On that basis, Mr Speaker, to suit the convenience of the House, I would ask that you suspend the sitting and leave the chair with the intention of ringing the bells at a later hour, which, for the information of members, is intended to be 8 am tomorrow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022, we're building a robust regulatory framework around credit products and delivering on our commitments to protect consumers. We believe that strong, well-regulated credit products are a core element of a strong and inclusive economy, but we must balance access to credit with meaningful protections for consumers and remedies. The bill introduces essential protections for consumers of expensive credit products and contains a number of measures in relation to SACCs and consumer leases targeted at reducing unaffordable lending, restraining excessive charging, ensuring appropriate marketing of products, better disclosure, stronger tools for deterrence, and preventing opportunistic avoidance of the law.</span>

They're long-delayed reforms that were first brought to the former government by a review conducted by the former government back in 2016. Mr Speaker, I know this is an issue that you've had a long interest in in your time in parliament. The reforms have widespread support from consumer groups and regulators. I want to thank the consumer groups for their positive representation on these issues and their consistent representation and campaigning around fairer credit laws in this country. They're long-overdue reforms and I commend them to the House.</span>

For those households who have seen everything going up except their wages, because for a decade, low wage growth was a deliberate design feature of the Australian government, today is the day that the parliament decided that that is no longer the policy of Australia. Today is the day the parliament decided to get wages moving.</span>

The union movement has paid a hundred million dollars to the Labor Party. This bill is not about Australian workers; it is about union bosses. It's not about their members; it's about union bosses. That's why this bill has been rushed through. That's the reality. This side of the House, when we were in government, operated under legislation that had been introduced by the Rudd and Gillard governments. We have presided over legislation that provided support to workers, and this juvenile argument that's put by those opposite that somehow we were against wage increases is a complete and utter misnomer—complete nonsense. We are in favour of Australian workers receiving more in their pay packets.</span>

                    </a>  But we are not in support of Australian small businesses going broke so that those Australian workers don't have a job. That's what we stand for, and that's why every business group in the country is opposed to this bill. That's why every Australian business group that went to the jobs summit with a promise from the government that somehow there would be consultation, that somehow you would have agreement and that somehow there would be a compromise position were there under a complete ruse. They know that they have been completely and utterly sold out by this Prime Minister. And I'll tell you what, the Australian public now more than once has been sold out by this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister promised a lot before the last election, and he's not delivering it to them now. I'll tell you, if you're a small-business owner employing employees in this country, the only thing you're getting from this government is great uncertainty and industrial disputation on a stage and at a rate that we haven't seen since the 1970s and 1980s. Ask Paul Keating; don't take my word for it. Paul Keating has called out this particular bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the reality here. The reality here is that real wages under this government aren't going up. They are not going up, because this government's presiding over policies that will see eight per cent inflation over the course of the next 12 months. Australian families who were on fixed rates of 1.8 per cent when we were in government will pay, under this Labor government, 4½ per cent or 5½ per cent for their mortgages. They will pay 56 per cent more for their electricity bills. And, under Labor, as was wrung out through the course of the budget—which they don't like talking about—gas will go up by 44 per cent as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element to this legislation is the abolition of the ABCC. In this bill, people can see crooks like John Setka and his like and the influence that they have on the Australian Labor Party. The abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is all about delivering power to the CFMMEU, and what it will do is deliver higher building costs to Australian consumers, who will foot the bill for Labor's excesses here. So, if anybody believed that the modern Australian Labor Party had somehow cut their shackles with the Australian union movement, that is all put to rest. The government promised a lot when they went to the election. But, I'll tell you what, Mr Speaker, at a time when inflation's going up, when interest rates are going up and when there is a cost-of-living crisis created by Labor, the imposition of an economy-wide multi-employer bargaining arrangement is going to hit Australian small businesses right between the eyes. What will happen in that circumstance—</span>

                    </a>  We know that they saw low wage growth as a key feature of their economic architecture. They spoke about industrial disputes but couldn't name one. Well, there's one industrial dispute that has occurred in New South Wales, which is in the rail industry. This legislation would have fixed that. This legislation would have allowed for there to be arbitration, which is what the New South Wales government wanted earlier and what the unions wanted earlier. But it couldn't be done, because there wasn't an appropriate bargaining framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a victory for the working people of Australia, but it's also a victory for the businesses of Australia, because we want to get productivity moving. But we also want to get wages moving. What this legislation will do is deliver pay transparency. It will deliver the respect at work protections. It will enshrine gender pay equity as an objective in the Fair Work Act. It will have a new focus on supporting the care and community sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a win for the heroes of the pandemic: the cleaners, the disability workers, the aged-care workers, the early childhood educators. They were the heroes of the pandemic and they are heroes each and every day. They got our thanks, but they deserve more than that. They deserve better conditions, and they deserve better pay. This legislation will get that moving again. I thank all those members and senators who participated constructively in this process and who have delivered an improved bill. This is the parliament functioning as it should. I thank all those unions and business representatives that I met with about this legislation for their constructive input into this legislation. This is better legislation as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that our first act as a government was to write to the Fair Work Commission, saying that we wanted to ensure that those people on the minimum wage got at least a $1 increase in their pay. Remember what this election campaign was about. I remember, day after day, holding up that $1 coin, saying that this was something that we wanted to occur, that needed to occur—that people who were the heroes of the pandemic should not fall behind. And remember what those opposite did. They described that as 'reckless'. They described that as 'payback for the unions', just like they have today. They described that as 'economy destroying'. They said that businesses would go bankrupt. I'll wait and listen for the businesses that have gone bankrupt and the small businesses that have closed as a result of that 5.2 per cent increase. Can you name one—one small business, one cafe that's closed? Can you name one? It's a big egg.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the secure jobs, better pay legislation will deliver that: secure jobs and better pay. We stand for it. We're proud of it. And we're proud that this legislation will be carried today on 2 December, the 50th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">08:17</span>):  The Greens support these amendments and support this legislation, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has noted, with the opposition fiercely opposed to anything that might protect or benefit workers, this legislation passed the Senate because of the Greens. The amendments that we're considering now include amendments that were secured by the Greens. I just want to briefly draw attention to two of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One is, as a result of the amendments secured by the Greens—and I thank the government and Senator Pocock for their support of this—people will now have an enforceable right to go and ask for more unpaid parental leave. Up till now, this was one of the few things that existed in industrial legislation as a right, but you couldn't enforce it. As a result of working together and us pushing this in the Senate, we've been able to fix that. So people, especially women, will now have greater rights to take unpaid parental leave. That will make a huge difference to many people, especially women, across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also able to secure changes that ensure the fundamental elements of the better off overall test are preserved. Shamefully, over the last decade we have seen workers getting paid less than the award. They were usually workers in low-paid areas. We have ensured that the situation of future employees will be taken into account when the BOOT is applied, and also that there'll be a right to go and get back pay if it turns out that you've been paid less than the award. That is an important right, as well as ensuring the essential elements of the current test, as applied by the Fair Work Commission, will continue to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put on the record those areas where we would like to see the legislation go further. We would like to see the right to strike fully restored in this country and the minimum wage lifted to 60 per cent of the adult wage. We want to ensure the review looks at making sure there are no ways that people can go backwards inadvertently under this legislation. But I want to place on record my thanks to the minister, particular the minister's staff, for working in good faith to ensure that many of those amendments were secured and that the bill was made better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take issue with one matter raised by the opposition. It is unequivocally a good thing that the Australian Building and Construction Commission is being abolished. For too long, in this country, if you happened to work in one industry, the construction industry, you got fewer rights than someone who worked in another industry, just because of where you happened to work. You could be called in and examined by the secret industrial police and forced to name names and have fewer rights than an accused criminal, simply because of the industry in which you worked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The test that we applied to this bill, to ensure that it was passed, was: Is it going to work for women? Is it going to work for low-paid workers? Is it going to help restore the rule of law by making sure that everyone in this country, no matter what industry they work in, has the same basic rights, including things like the right to silence and the right to be free from being pulled into secret hearings where you get forced to name names, in the style of McCarthyism? It is unequivocally a good thing that that is part of this bill, and that is one of the reasons the Greens supports it. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">08:21</span>):  I thank the minister for industrial relations for the process that has emerged in relation to this bill and the amendments, in what has been achieved in the other place. When the bill was first presented to this place I was quite vocal about the concerns I had with aspects of its rushed nature, and I remain incredibly concerned that there will be unintended consequences of this bill, in relation to small business. I'll get to that in a minute.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the benefit of a couple more weeks—ironically, for such drastic legislation—I've had the opportunity to get some feedback from my community, which ultimately is the most important thing for me. There are a lot of partisan approaches that happen in this place. You just have to listen to the rhetoric to see the polarisation around these issues. If my feedback is anything to people here, it's that communities don't want the ideology. They want to cut through the spin, the rhetoric of Labor versus coalition. They want to know whether this is going to work: Is it sensible? Is it going to work for business as well as employees? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback I've received has been pretty much evenly split, in relation to those supporting the bill and the principles and the broad hope that it will increase wages. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms STEGGALL:</span>
                    </a>  A bit of respect, please. On the other hand, I've had feedback from the community supporting amendments, supporting that it be improved, concerned about the unintended impact. To that end, when I look at the amendments that have come back from the other place and how they relate, I think it's important for those in this place to appreciate the nature of all the amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it was about amending the definition of small business. Whilst it hasn't moved to where I think it should have, in terms of 50, I do acknowledge that government has amended 'small business' now to 20, excluding seasonal workers and irregular casuals. There are also additional provisions and safeguards for businesses that have fewer than 50 employees wanting to exit a multi-employer bargaining agreement. On balance, whilst I'm concerned that that is still very small businesses—and I have questions for the minister and the Minister for Small Business that I'll get to in a minute—I do appreciate that that is a shift and a small improvement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also moved an amendment relating to the one-year grace period after the expiry of a single business EBA. It has been agreed to amend that to nine months. I appreciate that movement. The obligation to consider the relative size and scope of employers' enterprises and the extent to which they operate collaboratively rather than competitively should be considered by the commission, and there is an amendment that introduces a new reasonable comparability threshold into the common interest test. I think that is a very important test and amendment that's been agreed to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I advocated for updated awards to accelerate wage increases for the lowest paid. A lot of claims have been made about the effect of this bill, and I'm concerned it won't directly deliver increased wages in the way that an award can in a much faster way. I appreciate the commitment from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to review the modern awards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know my colleague the member for Wentworth moved for a review after 12 months, after passage of the bill, and there's been an undertaking for that to be no later than two years after passage of this bill. In relation to that, I would ask for the Minister for Small Business to regularly report back to this House on what engagement she undertakes with small business on how the provisions of this bill are impacting small businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remain incredibly concerned in relation to the area of child care, which generally involves small businesses. They are not operating with major profit margins. Whilst I absolutely support that that sector see wage increases, I have concerns about who will ultimately pay for it. If that ends up being families and parents, then we have not progressed the issue of affordable child care. I appreciate that, in that sector, it may well be that the government is at the table as a third party in those negotiations, and I would ask that there be a regular reporting that it is the government that is meeting those increased costs and not Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were additional amendments moved by the member for Mackellar that I very much supported as well, in relation to there being a veto right to an agreement between unions, allowing the Fair Work Commission to put to a vote of employees an agreement reached. I appreciate that that has been changed as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On balance, I have grave concerns, and I will continue to liaise with the government about them, but I will hear my community and support the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">08:26</span>):  I also want to acknowledge the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the government for the very constructive conversations we've had in relation to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. I agree very much with the member for Warringah that my community doesn't want ideology either. My community wants to see bills that work for business and get wages moving, because there are united views on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge some of the conversation of the member for Warringah and note that there have been a number of positive amendments to this bill in the other place, particularly some of the amendments that I put forward, which have, in a version, been passed, including for flexible work using methods other than arbitration, so that we can move to conciliation rather than putting workers and businesses in arbitration; ensuring that unions don't have vetoes over whether an agreement can be put to workers, which I see as a positive move; and in terms of the headcount included in small business. That is a positive piece. I also support the work that is making these businesses 'reasonably comparable', because I think that is an important threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that there is a review period now, which I think is really positive. However, I am concerned that this review period is going to be after the next election. That is a shame, because I think this would be an opportunity to improve this bill quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a couple of remarks in relation to this. I'm not going to support this bill, but I think it is in a much better place than it was originally. The reason why I am not going to support this bill is that I think that we could have achieved more had we made the multi-employer bargaining piece opt-in for business and then reviewed that in a year if it hadn't made the impact on wages that we had hoped. I do seek improvement in wages, but I believe that is best achieved through enterprises and workers individually working together to come up with better arrangements, rather than a multi-employer stream. We have different views on these things. I hope, for the sake of the country, that this makes the difference that you want it to make in terms of wages but also that it actually supports businesses. But I will be holding the government to account in terms of making sure that this actually works for businesses, because ultimately, if businesses are successful, then our country can be successful, but we need to get businesses and employees working together successfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that, in relation to the minister's commitment to review the awards, in the recent question time I was concerned that the review of the awards is not very clear. I believe that businesses across this country will thrive with simpler awards. I think it is a reasonable expectation that a 15-year-old starting out in the workplace can understand how much they should be paid without having to read 100 pages of the retail award. I believe that should be a focus of the government, and certainly I would seek to engage on that constructively, because there are business in my electorate that say, 'I will never have an enterprise bargain, because the complexity of the award makes it very, very complex to negotiate.' I have businesses in my constituency who have two auditors who review their wages just to make sure that they haven't done anything wrong by mistake. Those businesses are trying their best to do the right thing for their workers, but they are concerned that they could inadvertently make a mistake because of the complexity of the award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also argue that the government could seek to make changes to feminised workplaces such as child care by making an award similar to what has been done for aged-care workers in seeking to substantially re-evaluate childcare workers' wages. A 15 per cent increase in wages is something that I think many in the community, and certainly in my community, would support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by thanking the government for their engagement on the bill. I wish we'd had longer. I'm sorry that I won't be voting for the amendments, but I will be holding you to account to make sure that this legislation makes the difference that it's intended to make to wages and for businesses.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">08:30</span>):  I also stand to thank the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his office for having conversations with my office in Fowler. I agree with the member for Warringah and the member for Wentworth that we need to take the politics out of this House and look at how our policies impact the lives of people in our communities. I consulted with my community of Fowler. For the majority English is their second language, and so many small businesses I consulted with weren't even aware that the Fair Work Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill was happening. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those who were responsible for changing the definition of 'small business' to a business with a headcount of up to 20, which will benefit a lot of small businesses in my community. I hope this legislation will result in an increase in wages for low-income earners in our community. I will make sure that I keep this government to account and I will make sure that this legislation will have no unintended consequences, as the member for Warringah said. I intend to support these amendments and this bill for my community of Fowler. I thank the Senate crossbench who worked for long hours to get this bill back to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Like many communities across Australia, people in Wentworth are passionate about climate action. They realise the environmental imperative to decarbonise and they know that, if they get the transition right, there is a massive economic opportunity. So people in my community are keen to do their bit. The problem is they often don't know where to get started, and, when they do, they're frustrated that state, federal and local policies don't seem to work very well together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was this desire to accelerate community action on climate, to listen to people's concerns and to get different levels of government to work together that led us to convene Wentworth's first ever Climate Summit last weekend. Hosted at the magnificently restored Bondi Pavilion, the summit brought together Labor, Liberal and Independent state MPs, our three local councils—again Labor and Liberal—as well as business and community groups to help educate, inform and empower the Wentworth community to take action on climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With more than 500 attendees and 40 stallholders, the summit enabled people to explore the technologies, products and lifestyle changes—all of which are available today—that can save them money on their energy bills and get Wentworth to net zero. We heard from energy experts who are using the power of Australian wind and sunshine to electrify entire suburbs of our country. We heard from young people who are driving climate action in their classrooms and in their communities. We heard from local businesses who are at the forefront of clean tech revolution, from rollable solar to zero-emissions water. We heard from community groups who are bringing people together across traditional party lines to support a raft of local initiatives. And we heard from Wentworth residents, like Nick from Bondi who shared his experiences of how households can save money and reduce emissions through energy efficiency and electrification and also shared the practical challenges of trying to truly electrify and decarbonise your house. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tackling climate change is a complex problem and can only be done through cross-stakeholder, multipartisan and—absolutely crucially—community collaboration. I'm honoured to have had the opportunity to get those conversations going in Wentworth, and I want to thank all those who made it possible: in particular, the mayors and state MPs—Paula, Susan, Dylan, Gabrielle, Marjorie and Alex—who came together so constructively to support this event; Suzanne, Anthony and Alejandra from Waverley Council; Michelle from Woollahra council and Peter from Randwick City Council; John, Nicolette and Wayne from the Smart Energy Council; and finally to my amazing team—who've helped make this event a success—and the amazing volunteers, in particular, Eliana, Brooke, Maria, Nick, Martin, Tina and Kath.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  Today is World AIDS Day and today we pause and reflect on the impact of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic on our country and the world. Since its first appearance in 1979, HIV/AIDS has killed around 40 million people worldwide, including about 8,000 in Australia. There are still over 20,000 people in Australia living with HIV. My electorate of Macnamara was one of the hardest-hit areas during the height of the epidemic during the eighties and the nineties. Many of my constituents are still living with the legacy of HIV/AIDS—a legacy of chronic illness, loss and bereavement. This is because my electorate covers much of the residential, social and business centre of Melbourne's LGBTIQ community and it was gay and bisexual men who were hit hardest by HIV/AIDS during its initial onslaught. Others groups affected in my electorate were injecting drug users and sex workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of HIV/AIDS in Australia is not just one of grief and loss; it's also the story of how Australia fought back against this disease. The LGBTIQ community mounted a highly successful education and prevention campaign which saved literally thousands of lives. They worked with governments and medical professionals to reduce transmissions and care for those living with the disease. We saw the LGBTIQ community mobilise again this year as they worked to educate and protect each other against the emergence of mpox. This is a community whose members care deeply about each other, and continuing to work with community led organisations is the best way for government to combat new health challenges. I feel privileged to represent many of the people who led the fight against HIV and AIDS in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a special mention of David Menadue OAM, who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and has been one of the most prominent advocates for people living with HIV. I recently had the pleasure of attending David's 70th birthday celebrations at the Pride Centre in Victoria. It was a great night full of people who, frankly, were worried about the future of the next 10 years, let alone what the rest of their lives were going to looking like. Many of these people who were there had known David for decades. We were celebrating his 70th birthday, something we were nervous he wasn't going to make, but he was there and he was proud and he was having a wonderful time. I would also like to mention Dr Adam Carr. Adam is a member of my team and, during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, he was a brave and outspoken journalist and activist. He was also a founding member of the Victorian AIDS Action Committee, now known as Thorne Harbour Health. Thank you, David and Adam, for your immeasurable contribution to Australia's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we reflect on the success of this response, as well as remembering the many young lives that were cut too short by this disease. The story of HIV is one of devastation but also one of immeasurable hope and of people working together to save each other's lives, often in front of government and the medical fraternity. It is a great story, and I'm proud of those who led that fight.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  Earlier this year, devastating floods hit many Queensland communities hard, including in my electorate of Bonner. During the floods, my team and I were out in the community delivering sandbags, removing equipment from local sporting clubs and checking in on local residents during this very uncertain time. It was heartbreaking to see the impact of the floods on family homes, businesses and community infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two sporting clubs that were hit hard by the floods in my electorate were the Wynnum Wolves Football Club and the Wynnum Manly District Cricket Club, located at Carmichael Park. The clean-up effort to support these great local clubs was an amazing show of community spirit. I spent many hours with my team, volunteers and club members helping rip up damaged carpet, removing waterlogged plaster from the clubhouse and cleaning off sporting equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of my local flood recovery plan and working alongside Wynnum Wolves president Rabieh Krayem I was able to secure $4 million of federal government funding to help rebuild, expand and futureproof Carmichael Park. I'm glad to see the new government has honoured this investment. This funding will go directly into the execution of the Carmichael Park master plan, creating a more resilient and sustainable venue for all the community to enjoy. There will be not only state-of-the-art cricket and soccer facilities but also a family clubhouse, an art precinct and an array of dining options. An Indigenous canoeing adventure trail along Bulimba Creek, which backs onto Carmichael Park, is also in the works. Overseen by bayside legend and Quandamooka man Cameron Costello, this will help bring economic, social and cultural benefits to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 101 years old, the Wynnum Wolves Football Club currently has 960 members, with predictions to grow to 1,200 next year. It is exciting to see that 30 per cent of the participation comes from female players, with female participation expected to make up 40 per cent of the players by 2025. The Wynnum Manly District Cricket Club is an integral part of our sporting community and I'm proud to say that it is one of the integral clubs of Brisbane, with 350 juniors and 250 senior players at the club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This expansion and rebuild will allow the clubs a chance to host high-quality state and national championships. It will also deliver the opportunity to connect our local community to international counterparts for the upcoming 2032 Olympics. Once complete, I'm proud to say, Carmichael Park will be one of the best sporting multi-user facilities in South-East Queensland. To the team behind this project—Rabieh and his wife, Vicky; Cameron; Graham Mapri; and Geoff Teys—I want to say a massive thank you for helping to create future sporting, economic and cultural opportunities for our community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">ELLIOT</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  I rise to highlight the very important matter of a Voice to Parliament, and why it is so incredibly important we all embrace this. I'm very proud to be a part of the Albanese Labor government, which is committed to implementing the Uluru statement in full, as written—Voice, Treaty, Truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a product of one of the most historically significant consultation processes with First Nations people in our nation's history. It calls for a voice to parliament enshrined in the Constitution, followed by the establishment of a makarrata commission to oversee processes for agreement-making and truth-telling. The statement is such a generous invitation from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to all Australians to walk together in a movement for everyone, and I believe Australians will support a voice to parliament. As the Minister of Indigenous Australians has said: 'This is a decision that the Australian people will make. The referendum will belong to the Australian people, not politicians.' A constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament is a meaningful and practical reform. It will include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the founding document of our country. Of course, in May 2017, over 250 delegates gathered at Mutitjulu near Uluru and put their signatures to a historic statement: the Statement from the Heart, an invitation to the nation to create a better future for everyone. In July this year the Prime Minister set out a road map to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart, including a possible question and amendment to the Constitution for the Voice to Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a radical step; it is an important one in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples having a say in their future. All this follows a decade of consideration by constitutional experts, First Nations leaders, parliamentary committees and First Nations communities. The necessity for a voice in our parliament is a matter of common sense. It is from the heart; it is about giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders a say about what matters in their communities and what affects their communities. It's not a veto or a third chamber; it's about having a voice. I believe that the majority of Australians will also support this. The Voice is an issue that is, and should be, above politics. That's why I, like many others, was disappointed with the National Party's recent public position in opposing it. I say to them that I hope they reconsider. I call on them to rethink this position. It's a generous invitation, because it's about having a say and having a voice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History is calling on all of us to take up this very generous invitation and act to make this constitutional reform, and it's up to all of us to talk, to listen and to bring people together to deliver—together—a voice to this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  On Monday night, I received a phone call from a constituent of mine, Ian Van der Woude, who, along with his partner, Michelle Christoe, owns the NightQuarter. It was a very distressing phone call to advise me that he had had to put the business into administration. I want to thank him and Michelle for the amazing work they've done in bringing international live acts to the Sunshine Coast. They are great supporters of national and local artists. They put their blood, sweat and tears into that business and they spent millions of their own money, but COVID and floods, among other things, got the better of them. I want them to know that the Sunshine Coast are very proud of them and of the work that they have done. My heart breaks because of what has happened for them. It's a very sad day for them and it's a very sad day for our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to wish all my constituents in Fisher, and all Australians, a very merry Christmas and a happy new year. It has been a challenging year for many of us but, as they say, that which does not kill us makes us stronger, and let's hope that that old adage is very true. I want to pay tribute to my family, who have given me great support in doing this job, but I want to pay particular tribute to my staff. I know that we all, in this place, are helped immeasurably by our respective staff. When I took on this job in July 2016, Leanne Welch was the first one to put her hand up, and, sadly, she's leaving me at the end of this year. Leanne, thank you so much for everything you have done. As my constituency manager you are the front line of my office, you have helped thousands of people, and you've led a small team of constituency officers in my office for over six years now. You've done me proud. In fact, all my staff do me proud every day. Jak, you've been an amazing all-rounder. Thanks for all your support. Greg, equally, you've been a great addition to the team. Katie has been amazing. She's on holidays at the moment, so probably won't hear this. Emelia, thanks for your support. We look forward to Michelle and Tim coming onboard next year and relieving Leanne. Leanne, we're not going to lose you altogether. I hope we can continue to use your services on a part-time basis. But thank you for your support; I would not be able to do this job without you, nor would I be able to do it without the support of my family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  Last week, I completed six months of being the elected federal member for Holt. What an incredible six months it has been. There aren't enough words to describe my gratitude for having the opportunity to represent such a safe, supportive and welcoming community. While I have spoken at length about the diversity of this wonderful community, today I would like to spare a few minutes to give everyone a quick tour of some of my favourite places in the electorate. I also emphasise that Holt is one electorate but many worlds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we travel down the South Gippsland Highway, which runs diagonally from end to end through the middle of my electorate, our first stop is the suburb of Hampton Park. Since its establishment in the post-world-war area, the suburb was welcomed with open arms people of all sorts to establish a new home for themselves and their families. One of my favourite places in the suburb is KM Reedy Reserve. The reserve is home to the Hampton Park united soccer club and is named after Ken Reedy, a local legend who was instrumental in establishing the Hampton Park CFA fire station, Uniting Church and scout hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our next stop, in Cranbourne North, is the Cranbourne Golf Club, an institution which symbolises the community coming together and uniting in support of hope over hate. It was opened on 9 April 1954 by a group of friends from Melbourne's Jewish community who wanted to enjoy a game of golf free from the discrimination they faced at several Victorian venues at the time. Despite its humble beginnings, the club quickly grew to be among Melbourne's premier golfing facilities and has often been described as a hidden jewel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, we zoom down the highway as it turns into High Street, Cranbourne. It resumes being a highway near our next stop, the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, one of two in Victoria. Within these 363 hectares is the Australian Garden, an award-winning contemporary botanic garden which celebrates the beauty and diversity of Australian flora by displaying over 100,000 plants from 1,900 plant varieties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our last stop is the Moonlit Sanctuary in Pearcedale, a place where you can experience lantern-lit tours that showcase the rare and unusual animals that roam in the Australian bush. These include many endangered species that have survived due to conservation breeding programs, including the squirrel gliders, the New Holland mouse, spotted-tailed quolls and orange-bellied parrots. If any of you in the chamber would like a longer tour, I encourage you to come to Holt. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  It has been a remarkable first year as the member for Flinders. It was, without a doubt, the privilege of a lifetime to be elected to this place by the people of Flinders, and I want to thank them for placing their trust in me once more. I'm excited to work with my community for the betterment of our electorate and, after Canberra, COP and COVID in the last three weeks, I cannot wait to get home and get some sand between my toes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank my predecessor, the Hon. Greg Hunt, for his unwavering support, advice and remarkable example to all of us in this place. I thank and recognise former state members in my area: former member for Mornington, David Morris; former member for Hastings, Neale Burgess; and, indeed, outgoing state member for Nepean, Chris Brayne. I understand Chris's long-serving staff member, Josh Sinclair, has this morning been announced as the CEO of the Committee for Mornington Peninsula, a committee on whose board I served until a year ago. I congratulate Josh and look forward to working with him in his new capacity. I thank the Victorian Liberal candidates for Mornington, Hastings and Nepean, Chris Crewther, Briony Hutton and Sam Groth. There are no better friends on what has been a long campaign trail of a year's duration. I thank former mayor and deputy of the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, Anthony Marsh and Lisa Dixon, and congratulate heartily the incoming mayor and deputy, Steve Holland and Debra Mar. My thanks to CEO John Baker. He has a big job, and never more so than in a double-whammy federal and state election year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our outstanding volunteers in our sports clubs, landcare groups, community houses and many other community organisations: thank you for your tireless work, which beats the drum to the heartbeat of our community. My special thanks to Jeremy Maxwell and Ben Smith for the guidance they have provided to me this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our remarkable first responders, police, fire, SES and ambulance, who work every day and night to keep us safe: it has been a big year for you and may well be again over this summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our nurses and aged-care staff, who've worked and continue to work tirelessly through the pandemic and beyond: we owe you a debt of gratitude, and I hope this year you get some rest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge our first responders, aged-care workers, nurses and hospital staff who continue to work through our Christmas period, often the busiest period of the year, for forgoing their precious family time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my new parliamentary colleagues: it has been a pleasure to get to know you and work with you in this place. In particular, I thank my friends the members for Menzies and Casey in Victoria. You chaps keep me sane. I am so grateful you are here. I thank my awesome private office team, Matthew Head, Melissa Ritter, Julia Doyle, Marshall Grande, Katie Wilkie and, until last Friday, Mathew Langdon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my dear family, Rodrigo, Estela, Rafael and Gabriel, for loving me and supporting me despite the grand adventure I have set us all on this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to my constituents, the good folk of Flinders: thank you for sharing your experiences, needs, wants, fears and vision for our community, like local schoolchildren Taj, Ava and Lucy, whose speeches I read earlier this week. You fill me each day with pride and passion for this job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish you all the best for a new year and look forward to working with you next year. Have a merry Christmas and a safe new year.</span>

Will states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been living with Type 1 Diabetes since I was 2 years old and luckily for me, my family has been able to afford the many costs associated with living with Type 1.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great speech, Will, and I'm proud of you and everything that you've done and will continue to achieve. There is, you're right, much more to be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is determined to continue providing the support and resources needed for those suffering from diabetes—type 1 and type 2—and I welcome Minister Butler's announcement in July this year that all 130,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes will gain access to subsidised CGM products under the National Diabetes Services Scheme. I thank the determined efforts of Diabetes Australia, JDRF and local advocates such as Sister Terri Anne O'Sullivan, our diabetes educator, and the paediatric diabetes team at Campbelltown Hospital.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's much more to do in our campaign against diabetes and helping those living with it. I thank Will again for not only his speech but his determination not to be held back by type 1 diabetes—to get on with his life being a productive member of our community. I thank him so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to wish all my Macarthur constituents, my parliamentary friends and all the staff in Parliament House a very, very happy Christmas and new year and a safe one as well. I thank everyone for their support.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I stand to recognise and acknowledge Sutherland Food Services and the work the team does in supporting the seniors community in my electorate of Hughes. Operating for more than 50 years, Sutherland Food Services was better known as Meals on Wheels. It produces and delivers healthy, nutritious and affordable meals to our seniors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The change of name reflects that it does more than provide nutritious food—although this it does, with 60 different menu options. Sutherland Food Services focuses on the overall health and wellbeing of its customers using a model of proactive care. For many of our seniors, unable to leave their homes or prepare a meal, the volunteer from Sutherland Food Services may be the only person they have spoken to or seen that day. Accordingly, it also performs an important societal and community function, an important welfare function and an important mental health function. Many individuals initially are reluctant to use the services. After all, who, of any of us, wishes to lose our independence or admit that we are losing some of our independence? However, the Sutherland Food Services model is centred on building the capacity of customers to encourage, facilitate and empower independence in homes for as long as possible. This means Sutherland Food Services, through its provision of food and other benefits, is assisting people to remain in their homes and to remain independent and healthy for as long as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sutherland Food Services is very capably managed by Sue Green, with whom I have met. It operates with only seven part-time employees as well as a team of 75 volunteers from the Sutherland Shire. The board of management comprises skilled and invested local community members. Its customer base includes more than 200 senior residents, many of whom are within my electorate of Hughes. Volunteers are trained in senior services and food safety procedures, ensuring that, at the time every meal is delivered, the volunteers will subtly undertake an assessment of the senior with whom they are dealing. Susan, I am sure, would not mind me saying that she's a very effective herder of cats, calm under pressure, and imbues in her staff her positivity, a high work ethic and a commonsense approach to solving complex issues that arise every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been six months today since I was elected. I want to thank the people of Hughes for the overwhelming support that they have given me within my electorate. I want to thank my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House. I want to thank my electorate staff and, most particularly, I want to thank my husband, Michael, on whom a lot of the burden at home has now fallen, and to my sons, James and Nicholas—I promise I will make it to your formal on Monday night. In conclusion, I also thank all of the staff who work within this place, without whom we could not do our jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  International Volunteer Day is on 5 December, and in Chisholm we will celebrate some of our hardworking, wonderful volunteers with the reinstatement of the Caroline Chisholm Awards, which had been initiated by the excellent former member for Chisholm and much-respected Speaker Anna Burke. I announced last year that I would reinstate these awards if I were elected, and I'm delighted that I'm now able to celebrate the fantastic volunteers who give so much at these awards. All of our volunteers right across our community do such an amazing job. I want to acknowledge how much work they've had to do over the last two years to support people during the worst parts of the pandemic, through lockdowns and social isolation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Caroline Chisholm, for whom my electorate was named, lived a life of service to others and a life of care and of compassion, and her spirit absolutely lives on in my community. All of our volunteers, whether they're in sporting groups, charities, neighbourhood houses, crisis centres or emergency services, do so much. Our community could not function without them, and I thank them most sincerely for everything that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently had the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate some of our hardworking organisations through the volunteer grants program. I do want to thank the community panel that assisted with this round of grants. They diligently assessed expressions of interest received from our community and were well placed to do so because they themselves give so much as volunteers in our community. I want to thank Jordan Liang, Margaret Clausen and Nandini Sengupta for their hard work. They are pillars of our community, and I can't wait to work with them again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge my community. As I come into my first Christmas experiencing the great honour of being the member for Chisholm, we have had a really difficult few years. I have been so privileged to meet so many different organisations across this wonderful electorate. I want to wish everybody in my community a safe, happy Christmas. I hope people are able to spend time with loved ones. I know lots of families are doing it tough and, when I get back home sometime in the next few days, I will be spending some time with our Neighbourhood Houses and other community groups doing what I can to support those who are going to struggle this Christmas. I hope that we are all able to enjoy a wonderful New Year and I look forward to being back in this place working hard for my community in 2023.</span>

                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I begin by commending the minister on his statement in September and his timely response to the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. The royal commission that the last coalition government dithered and delayed in establishing is now well under way. I have to say, it was long overdue and it is somewhat disappointing that the Morrison government did in fact procrastinate in establishing it. That more serving and former defence personnel suicided over the past 20 years than were lost in the Iraq and Afghanistan over the same period is indeed a damning statistic. That it took so long for the Morrison government to react is equally deplorable. However, it has not just been the governments that have failed our defence personnel over the years'; it has also been the defence chiefs and the heads of the relevant government departments who have also failed our serving and former defence servicemen and women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome all of the measures referred to in the minister's statement, I believe what is also required is a change of culture throughout the sectors entrusted with caring for current and past defence members. Without a change of attitude from those entrusted with our Defence Force members' care, the measures announced by the minister will not be as effective as they otherwise would be. Some defence veterans have said to me that a culture change will only come if those at the top are replaced. I contrast the attitude of the paid officials with that of the many volunteer groups with whom I have worked over the years, who work with very little resources to do so much to support our present and past defence personnel. I refer to the Tea Tree Gully, Salisbury and Northfield RSL organisations in the Makin electorate and I am sure there are similar organisations right throughout the country. In my region we also have the northern branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Para District sub branch of the National Servicemen's Association, the Peter Badcoe Ex-Military Rehabilitation Centre, the military and historical vehicles museum and the team of Operation Unity led by Bill Bates and supported by a small band of volunteers. Earlier this year, Operation Unity presented a combined sum of $16,000 dollars to Trojan's Trek, Legacy SA and Broken Hill and Operation K9. All three of those recipients provide support services to defence veterans and their families and they do so, again, relying on their own band of volunteers with very little financial support. I work for many of those organisations and, in fact, with just about all of them, I was there when they were established. They came together because they saw a need that was not being met by the very department for which our defence veterans had previously served. They saw the need because they were all former veterans. Because no-one else was providing the support of the members and their families, all of those groups—and again, I expect there would be similar groups throughout the country—came into being to try and fill that gap. In doing so, I know they have made an incredible difference to the lives of the people they have been able to work with. But of course, their resources are limited and they cannot provide the same level of services to all the defence veterans around the country. Each year, some 6,000 serving men and women leave the service, so when you look at the total numbers around Australia you can appreciate the magnitude of those who need support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the work of Dr Glen Edwards. Dr Edwards served as a medic in Vietnam. After Vietnam, he studied psychology. He went on to write two books about the Vietnam War service and the psychological after-effects of that war. Those two books, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The War Within</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond Dark Clouds</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> provide an insight into the effects of war and the struggles of veterans and their families. Using his personal war experience and his studies, Dr Glen Edwards has devoted much of his life to working with veterans who are struggling with the psychological after-effects of military service. Again, I applaud Dr Edwards because I know that through his work many, many veterans have been able to get on with their lives. I've spoken at length with him on several occasions. I had the privilege of launching one of his books. I know how devoted he has become, as a result of his service in Vietnam, to supporting his fellow servicemen and women. Again, Dr Glen Edwards doesn't do it because he's funded to do so; he does it because he cares.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of war service on veterans and their families has been well known for years. Whether it's suicide, homelessness, alcohol and drug abuse or family break-ups, these are all too common amongst veterans. Indeed, I understand there were some 50 previous reports dealing with veteran service. Out of those reports there were some 750 recommendations, and the reality is very few of those reports ever saw the light of day and very few of those recommendations were ever adopted. It is time to stop turning a blind eye and stop pretending the problems will go away. That is why I welcome the statement from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel. I welcome his commitment to increasing defence staff by around 500 and a range of other measures he has announced which will make a difference to our defence personnel and their families, such as the establishment of veterans hubs around the country, increasing housing support for our defence families and increasing the funding that goes towards all the services required by the veterans and their families, who suffer equally. And support will be provided by additional staff in the administration of defence services around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be attending a veterans' event when I get back to Adelaide as one of my first public events. From my experience and from my discussions with veterans, there is a widespread common sentiment among veterans—that is, once their service ends, they are provided with inadequate support services. They feel abandoned. There's no transition advice or support provided to them. For those veterans who directly served in military conflict, who witnessed the horrors of wars, who saw their mates wounded or killed, who saw civilians slaughtered, those experiences will be traumatic and life-changing. It will affect the character of them all. For all those reasons, their service is unique and, because it is unique, they need those services that they have been calling for for so long. Our veterans deserve better. They deserve more than words and thankyous. The minister's statement for funding, staffing and housing commitments is very welcome. I commend minister's statement to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  With the work that we do in this House, we frequently are given an opportunity to speak about something that relates to us very personally. Today I'm very honoured to be able to stand as North Sydney's representative to offer some thoughts on the government's response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide interim report. As I read through this report, there were a lot of numbers that were simply breathtaking. For example, we know that there are nearly 600,000 veterans living across Australia and, very sadly and completely unacceptably, there are currently 42,000 of those veterans waiting for their compensation claims to be processed. We also know that more serving personnel and veterans have died from suicide than the total number of Australians that were killed during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with that number running at the staggering figure of over 1,200 deaths between 2001 and 2019. We know that research carried out in 2019 found that the age-adjusted rate for suicide for ex-serving women was more than double that for the general Australian female population as a whole, while ex-servicemen had the highest overall rate of deaths per 100,000 people, with 27 ex-servicemen choosing to take their own lives. Commissioners have noted particular concerns over the transition from military to civilian life, with approximately 6,000 people leaving military service every year, and they've argued that we must do more to raise cultural awareness about the issues that our veterans face: their health—GPs need to be educated—the culture that surrounds them, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and how it operates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, as I read this report, I see three people who were very close to me and who fundamentally informed the way I grew up. The first is my grandfather Delmyr Gosper, who served in the Second World War. He enlisted as one man and came home as a very different one. To me, while he was always a loving grandfather and somebody who I have very dear memories of, I know that those who were closest to him witnessed and experienced the trauma he brought back to his family from that time. I didn't have a lot of time with my grandfather—he passed away when he was very young—but I did have more time with my uncle Joe Marshall, who was also an ex-serviceman. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe was one of those very brave military personnel who were frequently dropped into locations to spot, to see what was going on in enemy encampments and to then provide that information back to the forces that needed to respond. As a family, we didn't know that for many years, because his record was sealed. All we knew, and all I knew, of my uncle Joe was a silent figure who sat in an armchair in the back of a room and was at times incredibly frightening to approach. But, at the same time, you sensed he had so much more to offer; he just didn't know how to speak it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I had the very dear pleasure of knowing Dave Stafford Finney. I knew him through his work with Camp Quality. He was one of our leaders down here in Canberra actually. He was an extraordinary young man. Dave was intelligent. He was witty. He had a humour that was wicked. He had a mother who loved him dearly, in Julie-Ann Finney. And still we lost Dave to suicide, when he chose to take his own life. How can it be that people who give so much to our country are left wanting so much in return? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission inquiry embarked in April 2021, and the interim report was released in August 2022. There is much for us to take from this interim report. There were 13 recommendations in the report, and I think they bear repeating. The first one hardly needs to be said out loud, but it is that we must simplify and harmonise the compensation and rehab routes in this country. The second is to eliminate the claims backlog. The third is to make the claims process simpler. The fourth is to ensure there's appropriate government funding. The fifth is to make sure the department that's charged with enacting all this is enabled and resourced to do so. The sixth is to increase the protections for persons engaging with the royal commission. The seventh is to provide exemption from parliamentary privilege. The eighth is to limit public interest immunity claims. The ninth is to improve release of information, because families do need to know what is going on with those that they love. The 10th is to focus on a co-design for the information. The 11th—and so basic a recommendation—is that we must have trauma-informed practices for information access. The 12th is to encourage further consent for information access. And the 13th is to co-design education on information systems. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we now have the funding allocated for additional departmental staff and we have more emergency housing. We know that departmental staffing caps have now been lifted and that the government is in the process of recruiting 500 additional staff. These steps are truly welcomed by me and the wider community. The sad reality is that none of these things will bring back those whom we have lost, yet many of these things that are now coming into being are informed by the echoes of their voices and our memories of them. Commissioner Kaldas, who was the commission chair, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public submissions into this important royal commission stay open until October 2023, which, I confess, to me feels like a lifetime away, and I know that to Julie-Ann Finney it also seems to be such a long time coming. We will then receive the final report in June 2024. I look forward hopefully to being part of a parliament that finally says, 'To those of you who have served us so well: we see you when you return; we not only appreciate everything that you did while you were away, but we are here to re-embrace and protect you and your families as you return to us.' </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  First, I want to thank the men and women who are serving on the RAAF base at Amberley in my electorate and the veteran community across Ipswich and the Somerset region for the work they do in supporting veterans and the work they do in engaging with me to achieve better outcomes for the veterans living in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a royal commission that the coalition didn't want at all. I remember announcing Labor's position with then opposition leader Anthony Albanese and Julie-Ann Finney, when, back in 2019, we called for a royal commission into veteran suicide. I was the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel. The government's response, of course, in all of this was an inadequate position, a national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention, which they announced in early 2020. It didn't have support from the veterans community. Labor opposed it, the crossbenches opposed it and eventually, when faced with a motion in the House of Representatives, the government had to be forced, as a result of a backbench revolt from their own team—the motion having passed through the Senate—into announcing a royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That royal commission found some appalling things were happening in the department. After the election, Minister Gee announced there were $430 million in budget cuts that had not been announced by the coalition when they were last in government. He said that in his evidence to the royal commission. His words were, 'One step forward, two steps back.' He said that their policy in terms of the processing had a direct link to the mental health of veterans and suicidal ideation issues. He described the processing and the backlog of up to 50,000 people waiting to be processed as a 'national disgrace.' They were Minister Gee's words before the last budget of the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not have a good record at all on this issue. When the coalition was forced to announce a royal commission, Labor welcomed the appointment of former New South Wales deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas as lead commissioner, and former Queensland Supreme Court judge the Hon. James Douglas QC and mental health expert Peggy Brown as the other two commissioners. I want to thank them for their service and the work they've undertaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We offered to work with the government in opposition regarding terms of reference, and the government ignored the terms of reference we did. They also ignored the expert advisory group that veteran advocate Julie-Ann Finney convened. They utterly ignored that as well. We gave bipartisan support despite the fact the government ignored our entreaties in relation to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to attend the opening ceremony and the hearing of the royal commission in Brisbane in November last year with three brave mothers, Julie-Anne Finney, Karen Bird and Nikki Jamieson, who tragically lost their sons and who turned that tragedy into advocacy. The royal commission is a culmination of years of tireless advocacy from these three inspirational women together with veterans communities, the RSL, Labor, advocates and crossbenchers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we've come out with some interim reports with strong and enforceable recommendations, which, once implemented, I think will prevent tragic deaths from happening in the future. This is a real opportunity to fix our broken veteran support system, to identify problems and solutions, to listen to the ideas of veterans, to harmonise the legislation, and we need to make the most of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, for a long time, the rate of suicide amongst our veterans community has been significantly higher than the broader Australian community. The most recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare monitoring report on defence and veteran suicide found that 1,600 ADF members and veterans with service after 1985 died by suicide between 1997 and 2020, including 79 deaths by suicide in 2020. This is consistent with previous reports which have revealed tragic circumstances, with ex-serving males 27 per cent more likely to die by suicide than Australian males and ex-serving females 107 per cent more likely to die by suicide than Australian females. Many who leave the ADF for involuntary medical reasons are three times as likely to die by suicide than those who leave voluntarily. It reaffirms why suicide prevention must be a matter of national priority and why we must remain vigilant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The death by suicide of any Australian, including veterans and current serving ADF members, is a tragedy. As Commissioner Nick Kaldas said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These aren't just numbers, but people who tragically felt they could not go on. Behind every death by suicide are family members, friends and colleagues whose lives are forever changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a travesty that Australia has lost more serving and former serving personnel to suicide over the last 20 years than through all of our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. On top of this, we know that many veterans and families have had bad experiences dealing with Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and have been treated appallingly. In many cases, they've not been able to access the support they deserve, compounded by the lack of information given about the tragic loss of their sons and daughters and also compounded by service related trauma. For that, we are all sorry. We owe a debt of gratitude to ADF personnel serving now and who have served in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the commissioners released their interim report in August, the new Albanese Labor government committed to responding. The report is a culmination of 2,000 submissions, 178 private sessions, and testimony from 208 witnesses. It's confronting reading if you choose to do so. We can't ignore the recommendations. They're 13 recommendations that fall into three categories and three themes: improving the claims processing, the royal commission administration and access to information by loved ones. I am pleased the Minister for Veterans' Affairs responded so strongly in a statement given to the House on 26 September, and we're following through on the commitment we made during the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations made which we're following through strongly and which has been implemented already was to remove the DVA average staffing level cap. The previous government privatised, outsourced and 'labour-hired' the Department of Veterans' Affairs to death. That was the evidence that came through in the royal commission. That's exactly the evidence that has come through, and that's what the royal commissioners have found with respect to the treatment of the department. Because we're a Labor government that knows the importance of secure work, we have lifted the staffing cap. The Department of Veterans' Affairs was singled out, more than any other department under the Morrison coalition government, for privatisation. Up to 50 per cent of people dealing with frontline claims processing were inexperienced people employed by multinationals through labour hire and outsourcing. That's the evidence that came through Senate inquiry; that's the kind of evidence that came through in this royal commission. The coalition government should hang their heads in shame for the way they treated the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has had a clear link—that's exactly what Minister Gee said: 'A clear link'—with the tragedies that have been occurring. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've hit the ground running. We've raised 500 additional staff in the department to reduce the current backlog of claims which blew out to 50,000 claims outstanding. That's 50,000 Australians who have served this country and who are waiting, sometimes for years, to get their claims processed. The royal commission is really important, and I look forward to the final report that's going to be announced in the next year or so. We have made commitments. We've made commitments to give another $15.5 million to support DVA's continuing engagement with the royal commission; there's $233.9 million put forward to engage additional staff—the additional 500 staff which we've already engaged; there's $87 million allocated to modernise IT systems in DVA to improve claim processing; and we've also put forward $9.5 million in developing a pathway for simplification and harmonisation of compensation. It should not be beyond the wit and wisdom of our parliament and the parliamentary draftsmen to harmonise the DRCA, the MRCA and the VEA, and I'm looking forward to seeing that happen. Many veterans are dealing with three pieces of legislation that are too complex to deal with. Veterans advocates around the country do a great job, but they are limited and inhibited by a legislative framework which is far too complex.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish on this note: the commitment for the 10 veterans hubs we're undertaking, including one in my electorate, will make a difference to building community and keeping veterans together. We must do everything we can as a parliament, and across the Chamber, to make sure that we get veterans into housing and employment and get them back into the community when they transition to civilian life, We must do everything we can to support those serving in uniform when they are no longer in uniform but in the general community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  As a former veterans' affairs minister and a former Assistant Minister for Defence, I say at the outset one of the words that sometimes seems to be the hardest word to say in this building, and that is: sorry. I am sorry for things that have happened to veterans. I am sorry—and, of course, was sorry, even prior to the royal commission delivering its final recommendations—for anyone who has experienced harm or hardship or sexual assault. To those families who have lost loved ones through veteran suicides: I am sorry. I know that the royal commission is important, and that is why we, in government as a coalition, called a royal commission. I know the tremendous work the former veterans' affairs minister the member for Gippsland did in this space, as have other veterans' affairs ministers too. I particularly mention the member the Gippsland for the work that he did in endeavouring, at all times, to ensure that veterans were looked after. The Department of Veterans' Affairs also sometimes gets a terrible rap, and I know the work that Secretary Liz Cosson and others do to ensure that veterans feel as though there is somebody wrapping their arms around them. They're not always going to get it right. It wouldn't matter what department it was; it wouldn't matter what political party it was; it's not always going to get everything right to everyone's satisfaction. And I know that some veterans choose not to be part of the DVA process, choose not to obtain the help that is available to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that when we were in government we provided free mental health support to those who've served in uniform, even if they served just one day in uniform. For all those who have served in uniform, that assistance is available. At the outset, I very much urge and encourage those people to take that opportunity up if they feel they need it. I also urge and encourage them, if they should so choose, to contact Lifeline, 131144, or Open Arms, 1800011046. There are other support lines as well, like Beyond Blue, 1300224636. It's 24/7. They've got a website as well, as do the other services. There is the Suicide Call Back Service, 1300659467. Counselling support is also available through the royal commission. To discuss that support, people can email—I appreciate it's a long email address but I will say it anyway, for those who might be reading this on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—dvsrc.enquiries@royalcommission.gov.au or they can phone 1800329095. Please take any of those services up if you feel as though you need it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is an important day for Wagga Wagga. It is the final day of the hearings which began on 28 November. It's the eighth public hearing conducted by the royal commission. It follows a hearing in Darwin in October. Already I know that the Wagga Wagga hearings have heard some disturbing stories, some harrowing tales, from people who have bravely, courageously offered their lived experience, such as former Australian Defence Force member Kylie Reynolds. She told some harrowing tales. It must take a lot to dig within and provide those memories of sexual assault, of serious injury and of the hardship and heartache that many ADF people have experienced, particularly when it was at such a young age. Kylie was just 17 when she enlisted with the ADF Army ready reserves in Brisbane back in January 1993. She completed a three-month recruit training stint at Kapooka, and it was there that she celebrated her 18th birthday. When you turn 18 it should be the happiest time of your life. It really should. Her prospects were bright, and she was making great strides in her service. Yet, sadly, she looks back on that service as being one of the worst, most troubling times of her life. She says, 'As a young female private, I was the lowest of the low.' She rose through the ranks to corporal, then sergeant and eventually warrant officer 2 and should have been looking forward to a great career. But sadly that is not the case. Hers is just one of many stories that have been told, and we will hear further similar experiences.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened closely to the member for Blair, the previous speaker. I think sometimes all too often we get a bit partisan with these things. I'm not saying every government member does. But the previous government did some good things in this space. We really did. We shouldn't just be mocked and knocked every step of the way, because there were some good things done, in what I say was a bipartisan way. He finished his remarks by talking about the veteran wellbeing centres. I have some news for him, if he's not already aware, about the Wagga wellbeing centre. I know Pro Patria and the Wagga RSL are very much working towards that. Pro Patria already has a facility, a building, an amenity at north Ashmont in my home town of Wagga Wagga. The RSL is very much forward leaning in this space as well, through the efforts of Charlotte Webb and Dave Gardiner, the sub-branch president. And yet the $5 million committed prior to the election has been stripped away; it has been taken from Wagga Wagga. If ever there was a centre deserving, needing—</span>

                  </a>  I hear 'hear, hear' from the member for Braddon, who knows Wagga Wagga well having been at Kapooka. If ever there is a centre that needs it, it is Wagga Wagga. It's the only inland regional centre with all three arms of the Defence Force. Since 1939 we've had a Royal Australian Air Force presence. Since 1942 we've been the home of the soldier, that long line of khaki stretching back to World War II. And since 1993 we've had a Navy presence in our town. They're based with the Air Force at Forest Hill. It's an important Navy institution. It has, generally, between 70 and 80 personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though we're a long way from the nearest drop of seawater, as I often say, the Navy plays an integral part in Wagga Wagga, and may that long continue. I know the infrastructure spend that I made sure was going to go to Wagga to upgrade and update those bases, particularly the Forest Hill base, was going to secure those services forever, hopefully. They were needed. Some of the buildings were antiquated, particularly at the RAAF base. They're replacing 1950s buildings with state-of-the-art world-class facilities—as they should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge and encourage people who have a story to tell to the veteran suicide public hearings to do so. There is still time, plenty of time—indeed, public submissions are open until October next year. I know this is going to make such a difference potentially in the future care and support that future governments will provide to our veterans. Already there is plenty of help and support and services available, and I would encourage and implore those people who have worn the uniform and those people who are considering an Army, Air Force or Navy career to avail themselves and find out more about what services are available post their careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just finish on this note. Just because some have experienced—many have experienced—hardship and heartache in their service, please, if you are considering a career in the armed forces, please pursue that. There is no finer work that you can do for your nation than to serve in our military. Our military needs you; our military supports you and there is care and support for you when you finish your career.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I thank the member for Riverina for his contribution to this debate in this place today. I rise to take note of the government's response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide's interim report. This response was tabled by the Minister for Veterans Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel back on 26 September. I've been eagerly awaiting the inclusion of this item of business as it provides me with the opportunity to speak in further detail about the interim report and the government's response, particularly towards some of the recommendations made through the interim report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I thank the Minister for Veterans Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel for presenting the government's response to the interim report to the House. It provides a hopeful pathway forward to addressing what can only be described as a national tragedy. I hope to provide the House with some additional context concerning the importance of the interim report and the government's response in relation to my electorate of Spence, and provide further updates concerning our pathway toward building a veterans wellness hub in Spence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, first, I am very pleased as to the nature of the debate thus far, not to mention the bipartisan nature on legislation or motions that have been before the House in the 47th Parliament that concern Australia's defence personnel and veterans. It is because of this fact that I do not wish to have my remarks appear to be indecorous when I note for the purpose of providing historical context to the establishment of this royal commission the fact that the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, credits himself with being responsible for its creation—crediting himself as if he wasn't dragged across figurative hot coals to perform a job that only a Prime Minister can do and establish a royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst the groups dragging the member for Cook, when Prime Minister, towards the right result were numerous veteran and service groups; members and senators on all sides of politics, some of whom are still here and some of whom are not; and, most sincerely with the cause, family members of former defence personnel who have sadly taken their own lives as they tried to adjust to civilian life. One of the notable individuals who campaigned and pressured the Prime Minister to act was, of course, Julie-Ann Finney, a remarkable individual who, in the face of her son's tragedy, took it upon herself to find a way for others with family who are actively serving or former serving defence personnel not to go through the unbearable pain she had gone through. I note that the Minister for Defence Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the member for New England both noted her courage, tenacity and lobbying efforts to force the former Prime Minister's hand in creating this royal commission. I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge her efforts as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the many members of the opposition who were around in the 46th Parliament are supportive of this royal commission and veterans issues more broadly, so I do not intend to lump them in with the former leader. Now, moving forward, we can all work to gather to achieve some common goals that the interim report of this royal commission has highlighted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that losing a member of the ADF during wartime is as much a tragedy as losing a veteran who has ended their own life years after ceasing active service. Many experience variations of post-traumatic stress disorder from what they have seen during their active duty, and others experience compounding difficulties with going back to civilian life. I note with a great deal of concern a recent report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which notes that in veterans and serving ADF members who have served since 1985 ex-serving males are on average 27 per cent more likely to die by suicide than Australian males. Ex-serving males who separate for involuntary medical reasons have higher rates of suicide than males who separated voluntarily. I also note that the figures for women are even higher. There is no circumstance where these figures can be deemed acceptable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics are only a drop in the bucket of some being collated parallel to the royal commission. These figures on their own are not just utterly upsetting to hear but also a lingering source of national shame until we have taken proper steps to identify solutions and implement them. The Albanese Labor government's response to many of the interim report recommendations tells me that we are making some good first steps. As Australians, we must take proactive steps to safeguard the wellbeing of those who serve and those that have served. It is the least we can do for their service, their answer of the call to duty and their sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is one that is dear to me not only due to my service in the reserves—I see many people I served with go through the same difficulties, faced by both defence personnel and veterans, that are outlined in this interim report—but also due to the veteran and defence population within my electorate of Spence. I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Spence is home to RAAF Base Edinburgh, a place I've had the privilege of visiting and hope to visit many times in the future. I'd also note that there are, according to the latest available figures, 3,820 Department of Veterans Affairs clients that call my electorate of Spence home. This is the highest number of DVA clients for any South Australian electoral division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This number is closer to 16,000 when you look to factor in those veterans and their families who are resident in suburbs that are directly adjacent to my electorate of Spence, which borders the divisions of Barker, Gray, Makin and Mayo. Especially now, in the event of the interim report and the government's response to it, we can see the tangible benefits of a comprehensive veterans wellness centre located within the northern suburbs of Adelaide. It is yet another reason why I'm proud to be part of an Albanese government that is committed to building a veteran wellbeing centre within my electorate of Spence. I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel for working closely with me on this undertaking, along with the efforts and assistance of the member for Blair prior to my election to this place. I thank you both for seeing the same need as I did for this project and for helping me to make the veterans wellness hub a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond Spence and the wellness hub, there were several recommendations made by the interim report worth discussing, because they would, over time, greatly reduce the anxiety, frustration and isolation that many veterans experience once they have left the ADF. Sadly, this is to do with reforms that improve the Department of Veterans' Affairs and, to an extent, the Department of Defence itself. DVA is, after all, a department that is tasked with providing a different level of support to veterans beyond the equivalent that would be offered by government to someone who wasn't a veteran. But, if you ask a handful of veterans amongst your electorates when you return home after the sitting week, you will hear a very different story. If they themselves are not in what they would often describe as something like trench warfare with DVA, they will certainly know a mate in the community who has had a run-in or two with the agency. Many veterans and their families are left feeling distressed, isolated, powerless and frustrated after many of their dealings with DVA over the years. I do emphasise the word 'years', especially in relation to the backlog of claims made through the various forms of military compensation legislation that is currently churning through our system. This is unacceptable, and it did not require a royal commission in order to tell us that something needed to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bravery of those who have shared their experiences with the royal commission, whether they are serving currently or have served or they are the families of our veterans. It must not have been easy, but a spotlight needed to be shone on this crisis. It saddens me to say that, for too many veterans and defence personnel, this interim report—and, indeed, the royal commission itself—arrived far too late, marking a tragedy that their families will continue to endure. It is a wound to Australia's soul that won't heal until these issues are adequately addressed. We as a nation can do better, and I have no doubt that we have a government in charge now that knows that the job to fix this system for the better will begin long before the eventual release of the royal commission's final report. In fact, it began long before the release of this interim report, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With some closing remarks, I would like to acknowledge the service of members in this place. There are 21 of us who have previously served: Senator Davey, the member for Leichardt, Senator Fawcett, the member for Solomon, the member for Canning, the member for Mitchell, the member for New England, the member for Kennedy, Senator Lambie, the member for Hasluck, Senator McLachlan, Senator Molan, the member for Braddon, Senator Reynolds, the member for Fadden, the member for Maribyrnong, the member for Herbert, Senator Whish-Wilson, the member for Clark and the member for Menzies, who is also my co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Veterans. Thank you for your service.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I recognise and appreciate the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Spence. The list of names that he read, which represents the respective electorates, their respective states and the veteran community, is, I think, an impressive list. I think that each and every one of those people on that list that you read, Member for Spence, takes it upon their shoulders to do the right thing, and they genuinely believe, across all sides of the parliament, in their cause and in the betterment of the outcomes for our veteran community, so I thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the interim findings of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, I reflect on not only the contents but also the recommendations. I reflect on a number of things as I go through that document. First, I reflect on the findings and the outcomes—the tangible things that are put in front of government that they can implement in order to rectify the issues highlighted by the royal commission. But in doing so I also reflect on the lived experience and the re-lived trauma of each and every person who gave evidence to that royal commission, including during the royal commission itself. It would have taken them to hell and back. I want to formally acknowledge that in this place and extend the support measures that are so absolutely necessary in these times of such reflection. I want to encourage those who have had to re-live those experiences, or if they know of anyone who has been involved in such evidence and is having difficulty, to reach out to the respective contact numbers that have been provided by the royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as reflecting on the royal commission, I reflect on my service. My service went over two decades, 20 years. The member for Riverina spoke about Wagga Wagga as our recruit training establishment. I spent 8½ years of my life there as a corporal, as a sergeant and as a warrant officer. It was there that I took those young men and women off the bus. Those young men and women had worked up the moral courage and agonised for hours in their own time to finally put their hand up, to go into a recruiting office and to offer to give their life in the service of their country. That, in some cases, was a naive obligation. They didn't know what they didn't know, but I reminded them of that as soon they got to the first Army recruit training centre, and it was there that that transformation took place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of our best people, some of our finest Australians, some of our most dedicated and service-driven young people. All they want to do is the right thing for their country. Me as an instructor, I had to turn that raw service into a capability, a capability that will seek out and close with an enemy in a foreign country or on Australian soil, that will kill or capture an enemy and then live with that, or put their life in another man's hand and expect him to do the same for them. The question often is posed: Why do soldiers do that? The answer is simple; it is because the person on your left or right would give their life for you. That bond, that transformation, that change of that young person I talked about earlier, the young person who got off the bus, is an incredible change that we cannot undo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot untrain somebody. You cannot un-see the things that we see in defence. I have served on operational service and I have taken young men and women into active service. The responsibility of rank is that when you as an individual put those soldiers under your command in harm's way and they are harmed, you wear that as an individual. You wear that as a leader. This is not spoken about anywhere in this report, but I want to recognise that today and I want to recognise the fact that, for our leaders in the military, that burden of guilt never goes away. When you stand at a military funeral and you're holding a salute as they lower a casket into the hole, the look of the bearers, the look of the mates, the look of those in the unit never goes away. If I close my eyes now I can see it in my own mind's eye and that will never leave me. I obviously have learnt to live with that but it will not go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want the average person in loungerooms across Australia today to think that this interim funding of this royal commission will fix everything because it won't. It is a start. It puts us on a path; it recognises the fault. In the military we have a simple way of identifying faults and correcting them. We identify the fault, we identify the soldier and we correct the fault then we continue the practice of the operation. That is exactly where we need to get back to here. The point I make, what I'm trying to say, is that all the emotion, all the fluff, all the retrospectivity need to come back to the outcomes. Everything needs to be about outcome-driven exercise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fought in the state of Tasmania to have money put into a North West veterans hub. A bloke I served with was a bomb technician. His name's Dr Andrew Clarke. He's helped me with that. He's a general practitioner, and we've set up a wellness centre that treats many of our veterans—and I shouldn't say the word 'treat'. I felt guilty as soon as I said that word. It's not 'treat'. It's 'work with'. It's 'be there for them'. It's not 'treat'. So I take that back, and I correct that. But, in saying that, I think I'm getting the point across: the language that we use is so important. The positivity that we need is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for pity parties has gone with this North West veterans hub. We highlight to veterans: 'You need to get off the couch, and you need to do something for yourself, and we're here to support you. We will wrap as much support around you as possible. We will not rest until your problem is fixed, and we will always be there.' And this is what they need. This is what our veteran community needs. They don't need pity. I implore people right across the country: please don't feel sorry for our veterans. You should look up to them, because they've done nothing but the right thing, and along the way they've suffered a few issues that need our support wrapped around them. That's the attitude that I want to have: a positive, progressive and outcome-driven attitude. I've said in this place before that I suffer from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. I'm treated. I have a tablet every day for it. I don't say that for pity; I say that to let all veterans know that you can have this thing and you can seek help. Support's there. People wrap their arms around me and help me, and now I'm operating at a reasonably high level here in federal parliament, thanks very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the point I'm making is that you can be whatever you want to. It doesn't preclude you from going on with a normal life. It doesn't stop you from looking after your families. That word 'family', I think, isn't said enough. I don't think we've covered that enough. As we look at the military, it is a big family. It's a tribe, and we're connected. I've talked about that. I've talked about the connection that we have to that big family. But, when you leave that family, that feeling of separation because you've lost your tribe, I think, is the start. I think that our real family unit—our spouse, our children and our wider family—is going to play an important part in the transfer of the veteran from their big military family to their new family, which is civilian life and a way forward. I don't think we concentrate on that enough, and it should be at the centre. It should underpin everything we do as far as support measures are concerned—family-centric treatment for our acutely affected veterans. I want to see a place where we can take the whole family. Those kids need to know why mum or dad feels the way that they do. Those kids are affected by that trauma, and we need to make sure that we wrap our support measures around them as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To rehash, I welcome the findings of the royal commission. I've always supported this. It's the only line in the sand that we can draw. But we need to remain firmly fixated on the target, and our target should be outcome driven. I want to thank everybody who's spoken today and everybody who's supported this cause, and I want to thank the brave men and women of our Defence Force and our veteran community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Assistant Min</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I'm pleased to follow the member for Braddon, and I thank him for his service to our nation and his work to improve the lives of veterans. I was fortunate enough to attend a veterans forum in Burnie in the great state of Tasmania a few weeks ago with the member for Braddon and to see the great work that he's doing in supporting veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has lost more serving and former serving personnel to suicide over the last 20 years than through operations during the same period in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that's a tragic statistic. That's the tragedy behind the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide and the individual stories of Australians who have lost those inner battles—the devastation wrought on families, friends and communities. The tragedy has been compounded by the fact that successive Australian governments have failed those who've served our nation. Governments have also failed families who've carried the critical burden on their own through the pain and suffering that they've experienced. That is why we need help to find a way forward. The royal commission's recommendations will assist in prioritising the necessary and important work ahead to better the lives of defence personnel, veterans and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the royal commission released its interim report. It contains 13 recommendations to government. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs responded on behalf of the government in the parliament in September. The interim report follows 2,000 submissions, 178 private sessions and testimony from 208 witnesses. It's important to note that the commission's been continuing with its important work, with hearings this week being held in Wagga Wagga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report's 13 recommendations fall into three key themes: improving the claims process, royal commission administration and access to information by loved ones. The Albanese government has already implemented one of the recommendations—that is, recommendation 5. They've agreed to nine, agreed to one in principle, and noted two others. We agree with the commission's recommendation for urgent and immediate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 1 seeks to develop a pathway for simplification and harmonisation of veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislation. That process has begun. A taskforce has been established in the Department of Veterans' Affairs to work with government, veterans organisations and the Defence Force to simplify that important legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 goes to eliminating the claims backlog. The government has agreed to this recommendation. We know there has been a backlog of claims for support through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Unfortunately, much of that problem was related to the cap on numbers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs that was put in place by the previous government. The new government, the Albanese government, has removed that cap. We're in the process of employing 500 additional staff to DVA. I've been travelling around the country, visiting DVA offices, and the anecdotal evidence that I'm receiving is that that the backlog is starting to come down because DVA now has those additional resources to ensure that veterans get the support they deserve and need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 3 seeks to improve the administration of the claims system. The government has agreed to this recommendation as well. It's clear that veterans and families have not had a good experience. They've not been able to access the support they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 4 suggests that the Department of Veterans' Affairs provide, on a regular basis, advice to government on funding needs. The government has agreed to this recommendation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 5 suggests removing the Department of Veterans' Affairs average staffing level cap. As I mentioned earlier, that cap is now removed. We all know the importance of permanent, secure work for people working in the Australian Public Service, particularly those working in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In the past, under the previous government, people were employed by labour hire companies to do work contracted to DVA to avoid the staff cap issue. It was a ridiculous situation. It was probably costing the government more money simply to meet an ideological commitment around staff caps in the Public Service. What was happening was that, people were being trained through the labour hire agency on the technology and processes at DVA to deal with claims, and, once they had that Public Service experience, they'd get a job at another government department on a permanent basis. All of that work that was put into them by DVA was lost to another government department. Why wouldn't they? If you have public sector experience and you see a permanent job being offered in another government department, surely you'd take it. If you had a family to feed, you'd take a permanent position. What the former government was doing was counterintuitive. This government is fixing that by removing that staffing cap and putting people on permanent employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 6 calls for increased protections for people who engage with the royal commission, and the government will take forward legislative reforms to the Royal Commissions Act after wider consulting on the drafting of those amendments. The government will also work with the royal commission to ensure serving and ex-serving ADF members have protections to communicate information to the inquiry without breaching general secrecy offences in the Criminal Code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations 9 to 13 all relate to improving the release of information by Defence and DVA to family about a deceased family member, and the government agrees to those important recommendations. We note that communication between Defence and DVA has impacted families and left a lot to be desired, and that's been raised by many families in their evidence to the royal commission. Work on that has already begun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the royal commissioners—Nick Kaldas, Hon. James Douglas and Dr Peggy Brown—for their work in producing the interim report, and their ongoing work with the royal commission. I also want to thank those who have contributed to the inquiry. Your courage, your bravery in sharing your experience is deeply appreciated. And we are, of course, committed to the task of saving lives and ensuring that we have a better future for defence and veterans' communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government called for the royal commission when in opposition, and after years of reports of too many deaths and the lives of too many being made worse off because of endless discussions. It's time to get on with it. Indeed the latest report, released last month, into the rate of suicide amongst current and former serving ADF personnel reaffirms that suicide prevention must be a matter of national priority. The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Serving and ex-serving Australian Defence Force members who have served since 1985: suicide monitoring</span> prepared by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is the fifth annual suicide monitoring report commissioned by DVA. The latest report found that 1,600 ADF members and veterans with service after 1985 died by suicide between 1997 and 2020. It includes an additional 327 deaths by suicide since last year's report, largely due to an expanded study period. That rate is too many. We all know we need to get that down. That is why we welcome the recommendations of the royal commission. We look forward to the final report in 2024, but the government are wasting no time. We're getting on with the job of those interim recommendations and providing DVA, ESOs and other organisations with the support they need to support those that do deserve it the most—our serving ADF personnel, veterans and their families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I begin by thanking the members who have spoken before me, in particular the member for Spence and his very generous acknowledgement of all the other veterans in the parliament. I didn't realise it was 21. You've done your homework, so thank you for that. And the also the member of Braddon, who spoke earlier. A lot of us will come in here with talking points, but sometimes the best contributions are straight from the heart, and he delivered it straight from the heart. I'm not Jewish, but a rabbi spoke to me recently when I was at a ceremony for an award that is given in the name of a Jewish Australian soldier who died. There's an award given to Jewish schools in his name. He said, 'If you speak from the heart, you'll connect to the heart.' I often think about him. We see those moments in the chamber and in other places, there's something about that connection that connects us as humans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a veteran. It's not a badge I wear too often or even know what it means. When I read the interim report, and I've read it twice, a lot of it's not familiar to me because we all have different experiences. I was very fortunate. Unlike the member for Braddon, I haven't carried burdens from there, and that's often just the accident of the way your tours went and the circumstances of life. Another factor is I was also fortunate that I didn't start off as a regular soldier, like he did and many others did. I started off, like the member for Spence did, as a reservist. It's not for me to replace the findings of the royal commission, but one of the advantages of starting as a reservist and then going full time and then back to reserve is that I have a foot in both worlds. You go from conflict and combat overseas to putting the bins out very quickly. It's something that feels normal to us, but it's probably not normal to someone who signs up as an 18-year-old or 19-year-old and has this intense experience for many years, and then they're putting the bins out and getting yelled at by their partner, and the bills are coming in, and there are other pressures on life. That's really hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a taste of that on my second tour of Afghanistan when I came back. I was a platoon commander. We were in quite heavy contact in Kandahar province on a Thursday and we came back that night. On a Friday I was on a plane, from Tarin Kowt to Kandahar, three hours later from Kandahar to Al Minhad, six hours later to Darwin, however many hours it takes to Sydney and then to Melbourne. And each time you went to an airport, you lost more of your friends as they went to their own places. I went from a platoon of 30 and all the support staff—there were 80 of us outside the wire—to, I remember, walking out through that gate at Melbourne airport on my own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so excited to see my wife and my then-two-year-old boy, and my wife was pregnant with our daughter, but I had this sense of loss that I went from this family of eight, as the member for Braddon spoke about, to my core family. I thought he said it beautifully: it is about family, and it's about the transition from one family to the other. I had that sense of grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many others will know this who've been to the bar. I went to the bar readers' course on the following Monday. I had one world that had become normal to me and that I had a sense of comfort about, and then I went to another world that felt abnormal to me. Your fear becomes relative. My fear and my heart rate went up when we were doing practice moots and you had judges asking questions. I had to go lie down from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The human condition is that we're more resilient than we think, and we are a product of our experience, so something that's quite abnormal becomes normal very quickly. That's what we do to 18-year-olds or 19-year-olds. We take them from their families—they're just kids—and we shape them into soldiers and officers who are ready to do extraordinary things. To turn your back to gunfire because it might be coming from this direction, knowing the person next to you has your back—there's nothing like that. There is nothing like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on the experience of many others that I served with. I won't name him, but there's a very good friend of mine who had some horrible experiences overseas. He's a wonderful person, but on his tour there were civilian casualties—babies and children were killed—from decisions that he made, and he ultimately had a charge placed against him of negligence, which was the first time that was brought in a combat scenario. I was his barrister, defending him. It was where those two worlds crossed in a way that I didn't expect. The charges were ultimately dismissed, but I often reflect on: how do you go on, when you were the person who made the decision and had to carry those dead children out and then your country tells you, 'I think you're criminally liable for that,' and then you are acquitted? Yet he goes to work every day as a mechanic, because he doesn't want people to pity him or feel sorry for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the member for Braddon summarised that so well. We often think of the cliche of the broken veteran, and so many are, and we've got to look after them, but there are a lot that just want to get on with life, even in the worst of circumstances. I often think of him when people say, 'You're busy today—you've worked hard as an MP.' I think, 'Well, I don't get up at 5 am and look up at oily cars dripping down in my face and try to solve problems like that.' He does it six days a week, and he's a wonderful person and served his country with distinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some really good recommendations in this report, and it's driven by the evidence that has been given by veterans who have had a personal experience, many similar to that and many for whom it's more the transition from that life of service and purpose to a normal life, which has its own challenges. I particularly like the recommendations about making the process simpler. No-one likes filling in forms. No-one likes red tape. That is supposed to be an article of faith of our party, and I'm really pleased to see that's a recommendation that the government is supporting. Of course we should make this process of getting help simpler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final few minutes, I want to address some of the recommendations that it seems the government hasn't accepted and, again, we support you on that. They were the recommendations around parliamentary and public interest immunity. The Attorney-General said in an interview at the Press Club that he was baffled by those recommendations, and I was too. Our veterans put their lives on the line not only to fight for their friends, their family and their country but also for some of the great traditions of our democracy and the rule of law. Parliamentary privilege and public interest immunity, while they can be abused, are key institutions of our democracy and the rule of law. The commission, with respect, over-reached in asking for royal commissions to able to abrogate parliamentary privilege and public interest immunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament has just signed off on an anticorruption commission. We welcomed that and supported that. But that commission will have authority over all of our ADF members, and there are enormous powers given to that commission. It may be in the future, if someone abuses that process, that they can come here and come to their member and get their voices heard. Parliamentary privilege is very important to our job. It should never be abrogated, so it wouldn't be in the interests of veterans or anyone to do that. Again, I commend the government for holding firm on that. It is very to say, when you get royal commission recommendations, 'We will implement them all.' That's very easy. But, in the end, they are recommendations, and the responsibility is on all of us to do the right thing by veterans, by our communities and by our democracy. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this and thank you again to the members of Spence, Braddon and everyone else who spoke in this debate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I feel a bit like a proud dad, even though the member for Menzies is not my son; although, he is probably young enough to be my son. It reminds me of the time post World War II when this place had substantial numbers of members who were veterans of World War II. We all look back on history with hindsight vision but I want to say that, by and large, with some exceptions—which I will not name so as not to embarrass them—the debate on this motion has been exemplary. It gives me a scintilla of hope that in this place we can reach across the aisle and work together for the betterment of this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were outstanding speeches from the members for Spence, Menzies and Braddon. I can't match them and will not pretend to. I have never served in uniform. I have not experienced what you great gentlemen have and I will not even pretend to. What Australians should take some comfort from is that members from across the political divide in this place, particularly those members who have served—I'm not saying exclusively by any stretch—that it gives me great hope that that spirit of service you employed while you were in uniform, you will carry that through into your service into this place. I'm particularly referring to a members for Menzies and Spence because they are newbies in this place and, hopefully, my alerting them to these issues will go some way to warding off the shards of partisanship which will no doubt be instilled upon them in this place if they are here long enough. But it's those sort of contributions that you've just made that make this country a better place. And it's those sorts of contributions which will no doubt, hopefully, lead to a better system for our veterans. I've been sitting there listening dutifully to these great contributions, by and large, with some exceptions which I won't mention as I don't want to embarrass those speakers. We need to do better for our veterans. We have to do better for our veterans. The member for Braddon's just entered the chamber—I've given you a bit of a rap, but don't get a swelled head, Member for Braddon!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country, led by governments across the political divide, has let our veterans down. I want to say at the outset, at the risk of perpetuating the myth—and it is a myth—that veterans are all broken people, that it is not true. I want to send a message out there to employers that the best thing you can do today is employ a veteran. Only a small number of veterans, who have served the country with great distinction, have trouble transitioning to the point that they are having great difficulty in transitioning to civilian life. If you want an example of the character of the individual that the ADF turns out, just look in this place. Look no further. If you want an outstanding individual with loyalty, smarts and resourcefulness working for you, look no further than an ADF veteran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On those ADF veterans who are experiencing problems in transitioning, the member for Braddon spoke so eloquently about that sense of tribe that is lost when they leave the ADF. I have grown to have a much greater awareness of that loss and that grieving. The member for Menzies spoke about that so well too. In just the smallest concept of the idea, I remember sitting at AMAB with all of the veterans that were leaving and we got a briefing from the CO. He was talking about how they would go back to their families and how their families were not going to understand what they had just experienced over the last six or nine months or so. I remember flying back home. I was in a coffee shop in Mooloolaba and I heard a couple at the table next to me complaining about the temperature of their coffee. I didn't say anything, but I just thought, 'You know what? It's really not a big issue.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had men and women serving this country for many, many years, putting themselves in harm's way. I think that we, as civilians who have never served, don't understand. That 10 days that I experienced with the ADF over there just gave me a glimmer of an experience of what you guys face when you come home. My hat's off to you. My hat's off to all men and women who have served, whether they've deployed or not. If they make that decision to go and join the Army, the Air Force or the Navy, they make the decision to one day perhaps put themselves in harm's way. The very least this country can do is to look after them and to look after their families. We have failed as politicians in the past. That is in the past. I want to thank the commissioners—Commissioner Kaldas, Commissioner Douglas and Commissioner Brown—for the work that they're doing. It is incredibly important work. That work will go on for another 18 months or so, but when that final report is handed down, that's when we as a parliament need to knuckle down and really examine that final report and provide the support to the veterans that have served us so well. I look forward to the report. I look forward to working with those opposite. This issue, perhaps like no other issue, is not an issue for partisan politics. This issue is about how we as politicians have been given a great responsibility to be in this place. We have a responsibility to our veterans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was listening to the radio in the gym this morning, and they read an excerpt of the Ukrainian President's maiden speech at his inauguration. He said: 'I want you to go and take those photos of the previous president down. Don't replace them with my photo; replace them with the photos of your children, and then, every decision you make, look at the photos of your children. Look them in the eyes and say, "How can I make this a better place?"' That's what we should be doing in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the government's response to the Juukan Gorge disaster and to highlight the risk that we run of seeing a repeat of a similar experience for traditional owners and of the loss of cultural heritage that we saw in Western Australia in my own backyard—the Blue Mountains World Heritage area. I have spoken many, many times in this place about the mixed feelings people in my community have about what any downstream benefits of the proposed raising of the wall of the Warragamba Dam might be, but in the wake of the Juukan Gorge response it's important to focus on another part of the consequences of the plan. The environment minister has made it clear that what happened in WA should never have happened, and nor should it happen in the Blue Mountains World Heritage area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The specific place we're talking about is what is left of the Burragorang Valley and surrounds. As Wilderness Australia explains:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The southern Blue Mountains is an extensive and rich cultural landscape belonging to the Gundungurra People. The rivers, waterholes and mountains of the Blue Mountains landscape tell one of the most intact and documented dream-time stories in Australia—the epic battle of tiger cat (Mirrigan) and snake (Gurrangatch) which formed the southern Blue Mountains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Warragamba Dam was built in 1960, it flooded most of the Burragorang Valley, and with it was lost a large proportion of the cultural heritage and Dreamtime stories of the Gundungurra people. If the dam wall is raised, many remaining sites of this story, including Indigenous archaeological sites, creation waterholes and cave art, will be destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What everyone wants to see is a thorough and detailed assessment of all of this before any decision is made about the project. To date, the quality of the work by the proponents of the scheme, WaterNSW, in assessing the potential impacts has been panned. As elder Aunty Sharyn Halls describes in the Gundungurra Aboriginal Heritage Association response to the EIS, one example is the inconsistent figures about what would be impacted; a number ranging from 174 to potentially a thousand, with little on-the-ground analysis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest analysis by the proponent, having been required to do more work, is even more damning. WaterNSW's own report says that the plan to raise the Warragamba Dam wall would cause 'irreversible harm' to Aboriginal cultural heritage. Its revised rock art analysis identifies additional sites and information about them. It says that there are 30 newly identified rock art sites that contain both typical and atypical motif styles, and 'include some rare sites with significant numbers of motifs and engravings'. The number of motifs presents at each site varies from one to 14.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to say:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of rock art sites are linked to the Gundungurra cultural landscape which demonstrate the strong connection and interconnectedness between tangible archaeological sites, such as rock art sites, and the broader landscape, with its associated intangible values. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a bit more detail, it says, the key results of the updated impact assessment are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      0pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A total of 260 known Aboriginal cultural heritage sites that would be affected by increased temporary inundation as a result of the Project.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It says most of these sites will also be affected in a cumulative way, 'Of them, six are considered to have nil to low resilience against inundation.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Project would result in the cumulative harm to the intangible values of the cultural landscape through extension of previously unmitigated impact on cultural values, from the construction of the Warragamba Dam and the flooding of the Burragorang Valley and its tributary valleys. The further flooding of the Burragorang Valley would result in irreversible harm to the cultural and spiritual connection that Aboriginal people hold to this part of the Country, their heritage and the cultural landscape and will obscure the tangible aspects of the creation stories associated with the Burragorang—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">such as the stories I talked about earlier. This is what they say is going to be a consequence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's summarise that. The report finds more than 250 sites of cultural heritage would be affected, including dozens of new sites, which include forms of rock art that are not commonly represented regionally, and the report's conceding there's likely to be far more culturally significant artefacts outside the area that's actually surveyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">UNESCO has raised concerns about this project's impact on World Heritage, and WaterNSW's own report talks about this. It says: 'The Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area is one of the largest and most intact tracts of protected bushland in Australia and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2000.' While the area affected contains only 304 hectares of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, which is a small percentage, it contributes overall to the cultural values as it's a cultural landscape with a 'rare and representative example of the interconnectedness of tangible and intangible values'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have, finally, this report recommending the impact that it will have. UNESCO has said it expects the EIS to fully assess all potential impacts on the outstanding universal values, including Aboriginal cultural heritage. This is the context of why I welcome, so strongly, the support by the Albanese government of the recommendations in the Juukan Gorge report, particularly recommendation 3. I want to go through this recommendation—and remember this recommendation has been agreed by the Australian government—which says:</span>

The way that this process has been managed by the New South Wales government has created extraordinary distress, and I welcome the acceptance by this government of the following recommendation:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F2S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCRYMGOUR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Let us remember that closing the gap is not simply a report. It is not words on a document. They are not words we simply speak in this parliament. It is not a moment to get a political hit. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it is heartbreak. It is lived experience. It is watching families suffer. It is the continuous reminder that we are not equal in this country. Let us remember that the very existence of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap rep</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ort</span> speaks to the torment of inequality. Aboriginal people do not get to walk on the same road as others in this country, and that is a deep injustice. It is the role of this parliament—all of us—to work to close the gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When enlightened people talk about closing the gap, they're not contemplating the recreation of Indigenous communities as carbon copies of some kind of notional perfectly functional mainstream Australian social entity, nor are they contemplating a process whereby Aboriginal communities are nudged along a government-ordained pathway towards a socially engineered destination of that kind. Instead, what closing the gap is about is supporting Aboriginal communities in maintaining and harnessing their many distinct identities while at the same time improving quality of life and the capacity for aspirational achievements by reference to a number of key metrics. These key metrics are applicable to any scenario where human beings settle permanently at a particular location and make a life for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you travel throughout the Northern Territory, in any such location you will be on the traditional country of a particular traditional owner or native title holding group where the community is on Aboriginal land—in other words, land granted under land rights legislation enacted by the government for the Northern Territory, or ALRA, as it is known in the Northern Territory. And then the other group of people are native title holders. As I've mentioned previously, in my first speech and at other times, work by governments to facilitate the success and longevity of Indigenous communities and, in particular, remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory—not just by reference to Closing the Gap metrics, but generally—is a vitally important task for this nation. The benefits go way beyond just helping Aboriginal people themselves, and perhaps, most significantly, translate into existential security within our geographic region for non-Aboriginal people in this country. In terms of issues which challenge Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, there are two things I want to touch on which go to the heart of where people say the gap isn't getting closed but is widening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is alcohol, and I did touch on the scourge of alcohol in our remote Aboriginal communities, or in our towns, which is causing a number of issues. By the mid-1970s, before self-government, alcohol became widely available for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth was running the show at the time—self-government came into the picture in 1978—and it's ironic that, by this afternoon, we're going to be debating the territory rights bill. Throughout the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, our communities experimented with the sort of social club liquor licence which some misguided commentators are trying to urge our communities to adopt again. The experiment was largely a disaster, with the same kind of outcomes as were seen in other jurisdictions and in communities such as Aurukun in Queensland. This ushered in an important phenomenon of Aboriginal community consensus about alcohol, led by our elders and, in particular, our women. This was to the effect that alcohol should play no part in the life of those remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consensus remained strong until 2007, when it was tragically and completely unnecessarily smashed by the policy vandalism of the Commonwealth Intervention in the Northern Territory. Although the Intervention did not change much in terms of the substantive effects of alcohol restrictions in place out in the bush, the whole branding and associated messaging of the Intervention gave younger Aboriginal people the impression that alcohol restrictions were something being imposed on them from the outside, and inculcated something of a culture of resistance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to drink is a spurious and culturally loaded right, but, given that it was the Commonwealth government which trashed the social norms which were previously in place, we need to try and do some work to assist our elders on the ground to restore it. The situation in town camps—and I'm talking about Alice Springs, Tennant Creek and Katherine—was different. The restrictions imposed there at the time of the Intervention were new. However, having put restrictions in place which lasted for 15 years, as I said in my first speech, there is an urgent need for a proper transition plan which prioritises harm minimisation. Without addressing the harm caused by alcohol, our prospect of making advances in respect of all of the other Closing the Gap metrics will be gravely undermined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community consensus in relation to alcohol wasn't the only thing smashed by the Intervention. The second thing was the community consensus in relation to employment, in particular, with regard to what was called the CDEP, or the Community Development Employment Program. I listened very carefully, yesterday, to the words of the opposition leader, on a moment that was meant to be a commitment to end injustice: they were, frustratingly, all too familiar. I saw them during the Intervention, and I've seen them come from the opposition for years since. Whatever your thoughts are on the Voice to Parliament, it was an invitation. I was part of that group that gave the invitation to the rest of Australia—an invitation from over 250 senior Aboriginal leaders and elders from across our country. I want to say to the opposition leader, the Leader of the Nationals and Senator Price: none of you were at Uluru in 2017. You did not see and hear the power in the room that day. Aboriginal people want to change the way the future is in this country. It is time to allow us to take that control and change and close that gap. Before we speak, we must listen, deeply listen and deeply experience. Do not talk to those who agree with you. Do not spend two days in our community and think you can speak on our behalf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the opposition leader was in Mparntwe, Alice Springs, for 48 hours. He did speak to some of the groups, but he thinks he can speak for our women and our children on what they need. Our women and children need many things: safe spaces to live, income security, a life free from abuse, culturally sensitive education and strong families and communities behind them. A royal commission is not one of the things we need. The critique of the voice to parliament is that it does not lead to tangible outcomes while the hypocrisy is absurd. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have called for a voice to parliament, and yet people still move to undermine it. A royal commission has not been called for by the communities, and yet we can come into this place demanding one. It speaks to the inability of those opposite to understand the predicament of our First Peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are losing a generation; let that sink in. We are losing a generation. It is on all of us in this place to work with conviction to safeguard the futures of our young people. Part of this sending a clear, unambiguous message to our First Peoples is that their voice matters. They occupy a special place in their country. Their culture and our ancestors are important. They deserve truth. It is time that we deserve a treaty. If what we are doing is not working, let's do what will work. Let's listen to what the solutions are that are coming from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There are solutions. It is important for all of us in this place to work together to make sure that we can close the gap. I've been involved in many of these reports, working with ministers from the other side to try and fix and put solutions on the ground. Aboriginal people have been saying for a long time, 'Listen to us, work with us; we can turn this around.' It's time that we all in this parliament listen to what those voices are saying.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  At the outset, I thank the member for Lingiari for her role in Northern Territory politics and the fact that she has been elected to this place. I wish her well in her endeavours, not just for  Indigenous brothers and sisters but for all Northern Territorians, all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the member for Lingiari to know that I was a big advocate for Lingiari remaining an electorate when the Electorate Commission determined unfairly, unjustly, that the Northern Territory would have just one seat—not right. Whilst I appreciate that the Australian Electoral Commission does this based on numbers, as a regional member, I know how difficult it is. Imagine if you lived in Alice Springs and had your member in Darwin. It's a long way from Alice to the capital of the Northern Territory. You represent 1.3 million kilometres and many far-flung communities. I've been to the Northern Territory many, many times, and I appreciate the amount of travel that you have to do. So I wish you all the very best and acknowledge the contribution you've already made to public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, closing the gap is crucial. We all know that. I know that there were modest improvements during the coalition's years in government. Life expectancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people increased. Nationally, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males born between 2015 and 2017 are expected to live to 71.6 years and females to 75.6 years. That narrowed the gap in life expectancy from 2005 to 2007 for males from 11.4 years to 8.6 years and females from 9.6 years to 7.8 years. That's still not good enough—nowhere near good enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the healthy birth weight for Aboriginal children. Nationally, 89.5 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies born in 2019 were of a healthy birth weight, which is an increase from 88.8 per cent in 2017, the baseline year. This is the official wording:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a good improvement with the national target of 91 per cent on track to be met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-one per cent—why wouldn't it be 100 per cent? Why wouldn't we want every child who's born to be of a healthy birth weight? It's a little bit like the road toll. I know we have a Towards Zero target. Well, if it's good enough for the road toll to be zero—and I appreciate that that's utopian. This is not utopian; this is very much more achievable than getting the road toll to zero, and we need to make sure that 100 per cent of Aboriginal kids are born at a healthy birth weight. We need to make sure that 100 per cent of Aboriginal kids have the same educational opportunities as non-Indigenous Aboriginal youth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a decrease in youth detention rates. Nationally, in 2021, the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people aged 10 to 17 years in detention was, on average per day, 23.2 per 10,000 young people in the population. That was a decrease from 31.9 per 10,000 young people in 2018-19. Again, we've got:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This … is a good improvement with the national target of a decrease of at least 30 per cent in the detention rate is on track to be met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, we're putting those figures alongside where we'd like to be. Where we'd like to be is: no Aboriginal kids in incarceration; no Australian kids in incarceration. I appreciate that life's not perfect—it just isn't—but we need to do more and we need to do better, and we will certainly work towards that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that I'm part of the National Party and I know that the National Party has made a decision on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. I have spoken with a number of elders in my the community. We have any number of functions when I am back in the electorate and I always take the time and opportunity not just to thank but to talk to, as much as I can, those who are doing the welcomes to country—which are important. I appreciate that Wiradjuri is one of the largest of the 500 or so Aboriginal nations. My electorate, from top to bottom—Yerong Creek to Peak Hill or thereabouts—is all Wiradjuri. But even Wiradjuri elders have told my local newspaper, the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Advert</span><span style="font-style:italic;">iser</span> at Wagga Wagga, that they want to see more detail about the Voice. Not only Wiradjuri but Indigenous nations, Indigenous elders and non-Indigenous people need, want and expect to see more detail on the Voice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made a decision as a party that, rather than a voice to parliament—the Uluru Statement from the Heart having been adopted in full—we wanted to see better outcomes for Aboriginal people. I say this respectfully and in good faith: when you go, as I have, and I know the member for Lingiari and others have done the same, to places such as Katherine, Alice Springs and Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory, Cunnamulla, Euabalong, right through South Australia and Western Australia—indeed, anywhere you like to go in this country, but, in particular, remotely—Aboriginal communities have to do without, and they shouldn't have to; they just shouldn't. It's dreadful to see some of the shops boarded up at night. They just don't have the options available to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to see the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Catherine King, the member for Ballarat, at every opportunity I've had since we went into opposition to lobby for a swimming pool and aquatic centre for Mornington Island in the Gulf because I'd been to the Barunga Festival in the NT just after I finished my tenure as Deputy Prime Minister—it was in the weekend before that fateful Monday. I'm sure the member for Lingiari knows the festival well. It's a great festival of culture, sport, music, bridging the gap. I was Acting Prime Minister that day. I was the first one to go since Bob Hawke. I was quite proud of that. I went there with any number of political colleagues and rivals, including the then Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then went on to Mornington Island, where we met with Kyle Yanner, who is the mayor of that shire, that island. About 1,100 Aboriginal people live on that island, and they don't have a swimming pool. They applied under the Building Better Regions Fund and didn't get the funding, more's the pity. Despite my requests, despite my best efforts to enable it happen in the subsequent round, when I wasn't chair of the ministerial committee that oversaw that, they still don't have it. I commit myself again right here, right now, to make sure that they do get an aquatic centre. And I commit myself right here, right now, to go back to that island when that actually does happen. It doesn't matter who's in government, who's in power, or whether I'm even in this place; I will continue to fight so that they get justice. I would hate to live on Mornington Island during summer, during the hot season, during the wet season, during any season, and not have the same amenity that most country towns and every city just take for granted. It's not right. It's not fair. It should happen. I know that the member for Ballarat, in good faith, will work with me to make that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the Voice, I want to see better outcomes for Aboriginal people. I do want to see detail around who will be elected and how they'll be elected. Whilst I appreciate the member for Lingiari mentioned the 250 representatives who attended Uluru to bring about this statement, 250 is but a small percentage of the overall Aboriginal population. The Aboriginal population does expect and demand more information, more detail, around what is going to be proposed. Australians generally don't like their founding document to be altered, to be changed. There have been, I think, 44 referenda. Only eight times have Australians voted to change the Constitution. So it's an important step we take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is: we have 11 fine, outstanding representatives of Indigenous Australia already in the House of Representatives and the Senate. I don't want to see their voices usurped. They've got there rightly, appropriately, democratically elected by the people, to serve the people, to serve Indigenous Australians, to serve all Australians, and well done to each and every one of them. I do not want to see their voices diluted in any way by a quasi-bureaucracy that will soak up, potentially, millions of dollars and not provide better outcomes for Aboriginal Australians.</span>

                  <a href="300246" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I rise to acknowledge once again the failures that we see within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the gap</span> report. We live in a country which was violently stolen. We claimed it was empty. We murdered and massacred the longest continual culture on earth. We trashed the country and culture, locked people up and stole their children. The<span style="font-style:italic;"> Closing the gap</span> report shows us that very little has changed. The gap is too big. The time it takes to close is too long. The injustices aren't simply historic; they're happening every week. First Nations children are still being murdered, stolen and detained. Cassius Turvey was murdered for simply walking home from school. Kids are still being put in spit hoods, and men are dying in watch houses. As my colleague Lidia Thorpe said, we are treating the symptoms, and it's not working. The gap is created by colonisation, and the answer is treaty, because sovereignty has never been ceded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year Jack Charles died. He died a hero to his people. He was part of the stolen generation and was placed into a home run by the Salvation Army. He was abused and denied his culture. Jack's life speaks better than any report can to the power of First Nations people in this country. This year the Queen died too, and it was in her name, the name of the Crown, that the land was stolen and declared empty, that children were taken and abused, for this colonial project we now stand as a part of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report shows that the removal of First Nations children is at an all-time high. Even after everything we've been through, this is still happening. We need to reconcile that. To live on this land, to extract its resources, to eat the food and farm the fibre grown here, we need to come to terms with that. The Prime Minister spoke about caring for country and doubling the number of Indigenous rangers by 2030. But First Nations rangers can't care for country when the government keeps opening up new coal and gas mines. There can be no peace until there is justice, and we need truth, treaty and voice. There is no justice in detaining a 10-year-old child in prison. The rate of incarceration of First Nations people is rising. The Prime Minister mentioned the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody but doesn't have a plan for implementing the remaining recommendations. These will save First Nations people's lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the Nationals said they won't support the referendum because it would not help close the gap, but I ask: How would they know? After nine years of being in government, the gap is wider, 10-year-old children can still be placed in prisons, and more and more children are being removed. The Greens stand with First Nations people and their call for a treaty, for truth and for a voice. We stand for justice against the state and the racist policies that are tearing families apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is once again disgusting in the picture it paints about the treatment of First Nations people. First Nations people demand equal access to health, housing, education and secure employment. We can do things differently. We can change the racist justice system, stop the racist policing. The Greens will not stand in the way of any action which delivers justice for First Nations people and we welcome the standalone national plan to end violence against First Nations women and children that is developed, delivered and evaluated by First Nations women and community-controlled organisations. We are pleased the work has begun and we urge it to be funded properly and prioritised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's up to this place to fix it. It is a stain on our nation and a great shame on all of us that this report shows how limited progress has been. First Nations people like Jack Charles are strong, capable, talented and exceptional. We have so much to learn about this land and its waters, about food, about plants and animals, about the longest-living culture in the world before it's lost forever. We stand with all elders past, present, and emerging in their struggle for justice and we are once again ashamed by the size of the gap and of the length of time it is taking to close. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  There was much excitement when former infrastructure minister Anthony Albanese announced on 22 June 2012 that the federal government would contribute $50 million towards the redevelopment of Macquarie Point. People talked of how the precinct was the last big brownfield site in any capital and how more than a billion dollars of investment would be unleashed. The minister himself noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sitting on the edge of the Derwent River right next to the historic Constitution Dock and a stone's throw from the city centre, Macquarie Point is not just a city asset, it is a national asset. In real estate parlance, the site has it all—location, opportunity and … availability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite rightly, the minister went on to add that while the design of the project was up to the people of Hobart, he said, Given the next stop south of Hobart is Antarctica, it makes sense part of to be considered for a tourist and scientific facility for Antarctic activity.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people at the announcement ceremony who laughed at my quip 'don't stuff it up' aren't laughing now, because here we are, more than a decade later, with virtually nothing except almost $40 million gone up in smoke. That is an outrageous scandal for which the entire blame lies at the feet of a succession of Tasmanian governments, Liberal and Labor, all of whom have failed to take responsibility for the project, to grip it up and to lead it. The redevelopment should have been finished by now. But what have we got? Nothing but a couple of Macquarie Point Development Corporation corporate headquarters, a couple of sheds, some garden beds and new road that needs to be ripped up—hopeless. Just imagine what that $40 million could have achieved ripping into the elective surgery wait list. Just imagine how many years of dithering and squabbling could have been saved if the lengthy initial public consultation hadn't been abandoned or if, right back at the start or just about any time since, the Premier had ordered into the same room the heads of TasRail, TasWater, TasPorts, the mayor and the head of the Macquarie Point corporation and told them they weren't leaving until they were all in agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what was required. But instead we've lurched from thought bubble to thought bubble. How about some Eden domes? No? How about we just drop everything and do what MONA wants? Although I must say that their proposed reconciliation park is important. And now the state government's latest idea is to build an AFL stadium with the staggering price tag of $750 million—or more likely well over $1 billion—to be funded largely by the taxpayer. Good grief. What's next? A Ferris wheel or an interplanetary space port?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder now Prime Minister Albanese has described progress over the past 10 years as 'appalling' and has urged the Tasmanian government to get on with the job. It's no wonder that I've reached out to both the PM and the current minister for infrastructure and made it perfectly clear to both of them that I don't support the Tasmanian government's request for hundreds of millions of dollars to build the stadium—not least because Mac Point is not the place for a stadium, because the precinct should be a free and accessible area for the whole of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, many Tasmanians, including me, would like a Tassie football team in the AFL. But I've also advised both the Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure that Tasmania has so many more pressing issues, with more than 4,500 people on the public housing waiting list, a health system on the brink of collapse, chronic underfunding of education and increasing traffic congestion. Quite frankly, if the state government have access to $750 million to spend on a stadium—more likely more than $1 billion by the time the damn thing's built—then they have $750 million or more to put into the services and infrastructure that the Tasmanian community desperately needs. And that's what the vast majority of the community actually want. So, until these issues are fixed, or at least put on a credible pathway to being fixed, I cannot, and I will not, support this outrageous misuse of taxpayer money. I urge the federal government not to be fooled by the Tasmanian government's grossly irresponsible con job and not to hand over even one cent for the Macquarie Point stadium project.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to talk about what has been a tremendously successful first six months for the Albanese Labor government. We've been busy delivering on our promises, busy delivering for the people of Australia, and I've been busy delivering for the people of Boothby. There are a number of issues that motivated me to run for the seat of Boothby. Chief among them were climate, integrity and fairness. I'm delighted to report that we've delivered real action on all three of these.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On climate we've legislated our ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, on the way to net zero by 2050. This sends a clear message of certainty to business—a certainty they have long sought when it comes to renewable energy transition. We've heard from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy that investors and business are already responding. We sent a clear message at events like last month's COP27 that Australia is back as a responsible global actor on climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week we've delivered the National Anti-Corruption Commission, with teeth. It's been legislated, and the process of implementation has already begun. This is something the previous government failed to do, despite having committed to implement one. And I welcome the reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act to further protect whistleblowers introduced by the Attorney-General yesterday, with further changes foreshadowed for next year. In May Boothby voted for integrity, and the Albanese government is delivering it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that motivated me to run has long been at the heart of my working life, and that's fairness, tackling inequality. I'm proud that this government, in just six short months, has delivered on our commitment to support a minimum wage rise for the lowest paid in our community. And frontline aged-care workers are getting a long overdue 15 per cent pay rise as an interim measure. This week, hopefully today or tomorrow, our secure jobs, better pay industrial relation reforms will become law, and we will start the vital work of getting wages moving again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also implemented the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report. Of course, there's much more to be done, and rest assured, I will continue fighting for the people of Boothby and for those in our community who are doing it the toughest as we move into the new year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other achievements that I'm just going to have to list them. We've made child care cheaper for 96 per cent of families in the childcare system. We've established legislation for our National Reconstruction Fund so we can begin the process of making Australia a place that makes things again. We've legislated to make electric vehicles cheaper and more available. We've handed down a responsible budget that has provided targeted and sensible cost-of-living relief and we've begun to deal with the disaster we were left with by the previous government. We've abolished the cashless debit card and begun a royal commission into the cruel robodebt scheme. We've cut the cost of prescription medicines by $12.50 a script, and we're providing continuous glucose monitoring machines to all Australians with type 1 diabetes. We've legislated 10 days family and domestic violence leave for all workers. We've started the process of extending paid parental leave to 26 weeks and we've made it more flexible so it works for all families. We've legislated to enable those on the age pension to work more hours, if they so wish, before this affects their pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We held our national Jobs and Skills Summit, which brought together business, education, unions and civil society to work together to address the critical skills shortage. Starting in 2023, we'll be providing more university places and more TAFE places, as well as fee-free TAFE, to help tackle that skills shortage. Of course, Senator Penny Wong, along with the PM, has made an excellent start on fixing our relationships with our Pacific neighbours and the international community more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of and thrilled with the cracking pace that the Albanese government has set this year. It is serving the Australian people, and I look forward to returning next year to more of the same. I'd like to wish the people of Boothby, my colleagues here in Parliament House, the staff of Parliament House and my staff back in my office a merry Christmas and a happy, safe and prosperous new year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr </span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">PIKE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  The cover of the Albanese government's new <span style="font-style:italic;">National housing accord</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2022</span> boasts a stock image of the Wynyard Central apartments, one of the most sought-after addresses in Auckland's Viaduct Harbour. Overseas luxury apartments seem a strange choice to adorn the Australian government's affordability manifesto, but as you delve deeper the document becomes even more dissociated from reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is one thing the Australian economy knows how to do it's to produce new homes. Home construction is not an emerging or declining industry. We have been world leaders at this for a long period of time. Homeownership has been an intrinsic and admirable feature of Australian society. It is an opportunity for Australians to grow their wealth and to achieve authority over their own futures. To continue this heritage, we need governments to get out of the way of home building, rather than interfere further in the market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The much heralded new accord sets a target of building one million new homes between 2024 and 2029. This is not exactly a stretch target, because this is on par with performance for pre-pandemic home construction. It is also well under the expected demand for 1.7 million new households that the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation expects will form across Australia over the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's affordability goals are similarly uninspiring. The government has committed to delivering 10,000 affordable homes in the second half of this decade—or, rather, it has committed to trying to get institutional capital to do this for them. As part of the accord, the states and territories have been asked to deliver a further 10,000 affordable properties. To give a sense of how unambitious that target is, the Queensland government has already committed to deliver half of that total by 2027.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'accord' holds a special place in the lore of the Labor Party, after the much-celebrated Prices and Incomes Accord of the 1980s. While an accord implies an agreement between different groups, it is entirely unclear who has actually signed up to this new policy. The only innovative aspect of this new policy is the $350 million Housing Australia Future Fund, which is intended to incentivise super funds to invest in affordable housing. Despite the promise of a $35,000 sweetener on top of existing subsidised rents, investors have failed to be excited by this new development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The silence of super funds in response to this policy announcement has been deafening. The Treasurer's new investor round table met last week to try to fill in the blanks as to how institutional investment could help boost housing supply. The deliberation of the Treasurer's new brains trust will not include any input from builders or property builders, but it can draw on the wisdom of five current or former Labor ministers. Super funds run the risk of facing a quasi-nationalisation if they allow governments to lean on them to solve social problems without regard to the impact on their members' returns. The response to this pressure from funds will be a drama worth watching over the coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government risks not achieving its modest affordability ambitions, there is also a broader risk in utilising taxpayer funds to draw institutional capital into the housing market. As new greenfield lots become available for sale, what hope would Australian mums and dads have to outbid super funds backed by Commonwealth concessions and with new investment mandates to meet Canberra's objectives? What impact would this have on affordability for those not receiving government rental support? Attempting to artificially entice institutional investment into Australia's housing market has all the foresight of the introduction of the cane toad. It might make an impact on our immediate problems but poses a bigger risk to our wider ecosystem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investor interest has never been an obstacle to housing supply in Australia. Supply is currently being constrained not by a lack of capital but by a lack of land. Our states and territories control most of the policy levers which currently restrict supply. The Albanese government's approach makes only fleeting mention of any focus to streamline planning systems and no mention at all of removing inefficient property taxes. The government's new approach to housing has so far established two new strategy documents, two new government bodies, and four new funds and amended financial facilities. More government is never going to be the answer to housing affordability. We need governments to get out of the way and let the Australian construction industry do what it does best: building homes for Australian families. On that note, I wish you a very merry Christmas, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I would like to acknowledge an important group within my community: the Indian Society of Western Australia, or ISWA. Incorporated in 1972, ISWA is a non-profit organisation with its headquarters in my electorate of Tangney. From its humble beginnings 40 years ago, ISWA has grown to a peak body of nearly 100 member associations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indian community is among the fastest-growing immigrant communities in WA and comprises close to 100,000 in Western Australia, including those who migrated from other countries. ISWA has helped encourage and facilitate integration of the Indian diaspora within the Australian community. It has played a pivotal role in integrating, sharing and contributing Indian cultural heritage with the wider communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to state that ISWA has made and is continuing to make positive impacts in our community. The current management committee, under the leadership of the president, Mr Satish Nair, has taken ISWA to the next level, with a strong emphasis on increased community welfare. The opening of a $4 million Indian Community Centre last year, also in my electorate, has provided the community with a home. The centre was funded by both the federal and state governments. I have been fortunate to attend several community events and deeply admire the work of so many ISWA management committee members and volunteers who dedicate their valuable time and effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping the ISWA ethos in mind, ISWA organised several cultural events to showcase the rich Indian cultural heritage to the community. The Diwali Mela Festival of India is the most cherished event. This year it was celebrated on 22 and 23 October and was enjoyed by an estimated 35,000 people. The family event was filled with cultural performances, heritage stores and delicious Indian food. We celebrate the message of Diwali: the triumph of good over evil. The colour, the spectacular lights and the decoration and festivities were captivating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased by the effort being taken by ISWA to encourage its member organisations, some of which represent different states of India who have their own unique cultures and traditions. I also appreciate the all-around community initiatives they have undertaken, such as by promoting a senior day-care centre to cater to the needs of the elderly; dance and music classes for younger students to learn the culture; language classes for the young so that they can relate to their roots; yoga activities; and connecting with many other multicultural groups to create a stronger WA community. It's amazing to see a volunteer-driven organisation achieve so much. I was pleased to see the effort they took in organising a COVID vaccination clinic, advocating mental health awareness sessions and addressing domestic violence in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so fortunate to see the multicultural community prosper in WA. The growth and impact of ISWA within the Indian community is testament to the fact that Australia not only welcomes but encourages multicultural communities to flourish and reach our society with their culture and traditions. I wish ISWA the very best for the future and encourage their members to keep up the good work. I will borrow a quote that I have heard from the Indian community, which I believe is Sanskrit: 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam.' It means, 'The world is one family.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Well, there he was. He was given the ball. He dribbled it forward, changed feet, got it on his left and sliced it past the keeper. Of course, I talk about Mathew Leckie. He became an overnight hero for every kid who's ever dreamt of playing in the World Cup—for every young Socceroo or Matilda who's ever had the aspiration to make the sport's greatest stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now down to the last 16 with Australia's one-nil win against Denmark. I know the Danes would be commiserating with themselves this morning, but what a fantastic result not just for the Socceroos and not just for the World Cup but, indeed, for Australian sport in general—not just football but sport right across the nation. Our nation prides itself on sport. Of course, at the moment, we've got the men's test cricket going on against the West Indies. I wish the West Indies well. I know they've got a couple of quicks, and cricket's strong when the West Indies are strong. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the key to sporting success is having the right infrastructure and programs in place. I know what we did as a government—we were criticised for it in parts—was having the right programs and funding, particularly in country areas, which seem to produce kids who are of the finest quality because they have to be the best of the best. They almost have to be Bradmans of the bush to ever make the state teams, let alone the national teams. They have to be that much better than their city cousins, because they don't have the facilities or the programs and, when they get to the stage where they can be selected in a state or national team, it's that much harder for them because of the ongoing training and expense. I know that, for Football Wagga Wagga, the new lighting that they received at Rawlings Park was the result of a $450,000 Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program grant. I know the president at the time, Tony Dobbin, was delighted at securing the grant. It went towards the cost of lighting fields 2, 3 and 4. Football Wagga Wagga has a vision to make Rawlings Park a national facility. They want to be able to train the Socceroos and the Matildas of the future. They want to be able to make sure that football at Wagga Wagga can be right up there, ranking with the other major sports—that is, Australian football, rugby league, cricket, netball, and all sorts of sports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say AFL, I mean AFLW as well. Women's AFL is the fastest growing sport in Wagga Wagga and the Riverina region, which is fantastic. Ganmain-Grong Grong-Matong won both the men's and women's competitions this year. It's a long name. It's a celebrated name. Ganmain-Grong Grong-Matong's football history goes back to the 1890s, as do many of the Aussie Rules communities in and around our area, even before rugby league broke away from rugby union in the late 1890s in England.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need better facilities. I know the sports program that Senator McKenzie oversaw had its critics, but it was oversubscribed so much that it made it all but impossible to allocate all of the funding that was well deserved and necessary. I hope the incoming government places an emphasis, too, on sporting grants, particularly for country sporting grants. You can't place a price on what that does for country communities. I mentioned the Mornington Island swimming pool in my previous speech. I will make sure that happens, by hook or by crook. I shouldn't say that now that we've got a NACC in. But I really want that to happen because there's an Aboriginal community that does not have a swimming facility. The next budding Olympic champion could come from that Aboriginal community in the Gulf of Carpentaria. I'll work with the member for Ballarat, the infrastructure minister, to make sure that happens. We'll do it fairly, we'll do it properly, we'll do it according to the books, but we'll do it. Kyle Yanner, the mayor, can rest assured I have his back.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298800" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  We live in unprecedented times. It's something that we've heard repeatedly. We're in the midst of a pandemic, we have global tensions pushing up energy prices, our country is currently grappling with floods, and we have a skills shortage. It has been a challenging time for businesses and people. But I am proud to be part of a government that's bringing people together. That's because the Albanese Labor government is about uniting Australia, not dividing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jobs and Skills Summit was about doing exactly that, bringing Australian businesses, workers and community groups together to develop a road map towards building a stronger economy that works harder for people and the nation's productivity. From Bennelong in New South Wales to Belmont in my electorate in Western Australia, community roundtables formed part of the jobs and skills roundtable process to discuss how we can improve lives and livelihoods by increasing productivity, unlocking skills, and creating good jobs and businesses for tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday 18 November, I held a Swan jobs and skills roundtable to provide an opportunity for 60 businesses and community leaders to have their say on how we can build a stronger economy that benefits our community. Joining me for this event was Toll Global Express CEO, Christine Holgate, who generously shared her insights on adaptability in an uncertain business environment. My community was excited to spend some time with Ms Holgate, who won the 2022 Australian Award for Excellence in Women Leadership. Christine is an incredibly talented business leader and influencer. She has taken the Toll Global Express cash flow cash positive in just eight months, and she deeply cares about her workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I equally have impressive organisations and leaders in the electorate of Swan. After learning about the challenges for people with a disability getting employment, the town of Victoria Park set out an employment target of five per cent by 2025. But then we had outstanding businesses, like Our Ruby Girl, a beloved cafe in Como. The effervescent owner, Sarah Yates, is trained as a psychologist and has worked in mental health in the disability space. Her passion resulted in her opening a cafe. Fifty per cent of employees at Our Ruby Girl have a disability. I like to think of Sarah Yates as the Twiggy Forrest of the disability space. Twiggy's keen and interested in seeing the transformation of the resource sector in a low-carbon future; Sarah is creating best practice for what employers can do to achieve loyal workers who happen to have a disability. I challenge more employers to be like Our Ruby Girl, and even the Town of Vic Park, who see beyond disability and set targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carol Hanlon is another passionate member of Swan. She's the CEO of Belmont Business Enterprise Centre, which provides advice, professional development and mentorship to small and medium-sized businesses, and has done this for 28 years. She's particularly passionate about women in business and the barriers that they face. She would like to see more support for organisations like hers that provide this invaluable support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we heard from John Kelly, a builder who spoke about the need for better support for students wishing to pursue trades so that construction businesses like his can count on future generations to have a rewarding, well-paid career building homes, businesses and community infrastructure. He was also keen to see increased skilled migration and was concerned about where people would live. Interestingly, Christine Holgate's concern was also the cost of rent for her employees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Albanese Labor government is working on some of these issues already, with an additional $1 billion, joint federal-state funding, for fee-free TAFE in 2023 to accelerate the delivery of 465,000 fee-free places. We will increase the migration program ceiling to 195,000 places in 2022-23 to help with those critical skills shortages. And we also have a plan to build one million homes between 2024 and 2030. There is more work to do, and that's why we have this consultation process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the participants were buzzing with excitement at what our future could look like. Thank you to those participants. And a particular thankyou to my state colleagues Geoff Baker, the member for South Perth, and Hannah Beazley, the member for Victoria Park, for their attendance and putting this event together. I'd also like to acknowledge the Town of Vic Park mayor, Karen Vernon, and the City of South Perth mayor, Greg Milner. Thank you.</span>
