                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Territories Legislation Amendment Bill will amend a range of Commonwealth legislation to improve the legal frameworks applying in the territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the Jervis Bay Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another key step in the Australian government's ongoing work to foster strong and sustainable communities in our territories, with rights and responsibilities comparable to other Australian communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These territories are an important part of our nation, home to some of Australia's most diverse communities and featuring spectacular natural environments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their governance arrangements are also unique, with the Australian government responsible for state- and Commonwealth-level functions provided for under an umbrella of Commonwealth law.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To enable the delivery of state-type functions, Commonwealth legislation allows for the laws of other Australian jurisdictions to be applied in these territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, in Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the laws of Western Australia have been applied. This supports the delivery of services such as health and education in these territories by the government of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend Commonwealth legislation to ensure these applied laws operate effectively, and support service delivery in these territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes arrangements for delegating certain powers under applied laws to government officials working in the territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, local governments provide a range of services to their communities under applied laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, local government officials' powers must be delegated to them by the responsible minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These delegations need to be regularly updated to make sure they are current. If laws change, there is a risk officials will not have the powers they need to do their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in the bill will address this by automatically delegating relevant powers under applied laws to local government officials. This commonsense approach will allow officials to do their work, without having to worry about whether or not their delegation is current.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make other amendments to account for the operation of applied laws in these territories. Where Commonwealth officials in the territories make decisions under applied laws, these will now be open to judicial review in the federal courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This improves the rights of people living in the territories and will ensure that decisions being made by Commonwealth officials are fair and correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personal information collected from people living in the territories under applied laws will now be clearly protected by the Australian Privacy Principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other changes will ensure that personal information collected by local governments and other local public bodies is managed in a way that is consistent with the Privacy Act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will improve the efficiency of the applied laws frameworks and increase the rights and protections available to those living in Australia's territories.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Norfolk Island, the bill will also make further significant improvements to its legal framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2015, the Australian government announced comprehensive changes in Norfolk Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was to address issues of sustainability which arose from the former governance arrangements which required the Norfolk Island government to deliver all local, state and Commonwealth government services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, the standard of services and infrastructure on Norfolk Island was well below the standard other Australians would typically expect. The roads and ports were deteriorating, the health and aged-care facility was outdated and accessing social security and other support services was difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, most Commonwealth legislation was extended to Norfolk Island. This gave people living on the island access to the age pension, Medicare, pharmaceutical benefits and the same social security payments as everybody else in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents of Norfolk Island were also brought under the Australian taxation system, replacing a range of inefficient taxes and charges being levied by the former Norfolk Island government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the significant impact and scope of these changes, some requirements are being phased in gradually to allow the community time to adjust. A good example of this is the superannuation guarantee paid by employers which is being phased in over a 12-year period, starting at one per cent and increasing by one per cent each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of some legislation was also deferred as part of a staged transition. The introduction of more laws with this bill will further support Norfolk Island's growth and development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow the Australian government to enter into an agreement with any state or territory government for the delivery of state-type services. This amendment provides flexibility, in case it is needed in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support economic growth, the bill will transition companies currently registered under local Norfolk Island law to the Commonwealth corporations framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will reduce red tape for Norfolk Island businesses and make it easier for them to access mainland suppliers, financial and other support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the bill will extend the Commonwealth bankruptcy system to Norfolk Island, improving provisions for people experiencing bankruptcy and increasing protections for creditors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, bankruptcy normally lasts for three years. For people declared bankrupt on Norfolk Island, if certain conditions cannot be met, they could remain bankrupt indefinitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make sure people declared bankrupt on Norfolk Island are treated the same as if they were living elsewhere in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing people and businesses on Norfolk Island in under the Commonwealth umbrella means they will have access to the wide range of support and stimulus packages the government is providing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important change will be to broadcasting. The bill will bring Norfolk Island radio and television stations under Commonwealth broadcasting law. This will allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority to issue broadcasting licences and plan for more broadcasting services in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this, Norfolk Island's local media will be better connected to Australia's network of community broadcasters and receive better support for their services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are a continuation of the good work already undertaken to improve the standard of services being delivered in Norfolk Island, and will help support its future growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few years the government has improved access to child care and other family and social support services. The island's health, education, transport and other community infrastructure has also been upgraded to make it safer and more accessible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of this is the improvements to Cascade Pier completed in 2018 which now provides safer and more reliable access to Norfolk Island for cargo transfers and cruise ship passengers, both of vital importance to Norfolk Island's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, if passed, represents the government's ongoing commitment to improving services and supporting economic development and sustainability, not only in Norfolk Island, but in all of Australia's territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian has been affected by COVID-19â€”some, tragically, more so than others. The OECD tells us that we are in the midst of the biggest global downturn since the Great Depression. We have weathered the storm better than most countries, and that has not been an accident. Economically, we have shown great resilience, aided by our quick introduction of programs like JobKeeper and our record levels of economic support. During this period, our export sector has been a source of strength, consistent with our long history of being an open, trading nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exports makes an important contribution to the Australian economy. Thirty years ago, Australian exporters represented 12 per cent of Australia's GDP. By 2018-19, that share had nearly doubled to over 22 per cent, contributing $419 billion of Australia's $1.9 trillion economy. The Liberal-National government has implemented an ambitious trade agenda, resulting in more than 53,000 (including 46,000 SMEs) goods-exporting businesses in 2017-18, up 18.5 per cent since 2013-14, and more jobs, with one in five Australians employed in trade related employment. Australian household incomes are estimated to be an average of around $8,500 higher as a result of opening up new markets through trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the number of Australian businesses that exportâ€”either goods or servicesâ€”is relatively small. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, around two per cent of the 2.2 million businesses in Australia are goods exporters. Australian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for only 14 per cent of exporters, in contrast to the G7 average of 25 per cent. However, exporters contribute more than nonexporters to jobs and productivity, on average employing more staff, paying higher wages and achieving higher labour productivity compared to nonexporters. This is because Australian exporters compete with companies around the world and are driven to be innovative and use the most modern technology and management practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cutting red tape and growing jobs through increasing exports is more important now than ever. The Morrison government wants to assist SME exporters to recover from the effects of COVID-19 and grow the number of SME exporters by providing better targeted direct financial assistance in a more simplified and streamlined way. This will help grow and diversify Australia's export markets, while also improving government service delivery and reducing regulatory imposts on business. We want to ensure taxpayer funding is used in the most effective and efficient way possible, with the greatest impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme is the key government financial assistance program to help aspiring and current exporters increase their marketing and promotional activity in international markets. Since it started in 1975, the EMDG scheme has supported over 50,000 SME exporters to enter and grow export markets for their goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. Last year alone, over 4,000 SMEs accessed the scheme, employing almost 69,000 Australians and generating exports worth $3.7 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 September 2020, the government released the independent <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of financial assistance to SME exporters</span>. The review was undertaken by Anna Fisher, a wine exporter and past EMDG recipient. Ms Fisher was asked to examine the most effective and efficient way to deliver financial assistance to Australian SME exporters to encourage additional export development and promotion activities. Specifically, the review considered whether EMDG in its current form was the most effective and efficient way to generate additional export activity among the SME cohort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review undertook broad consultations to seek the views of exporters aspiring, new and established; individuals; industry associations; EMDG consultants; and other interested parties. The review found that the financial assistance provided by the EMDG scheme is valued by SME exporters. The scheme helps offset the high cost of export promotion, accelerates internationalisation and encourages exporters to diversify. However, the review also found that the EMDG administration needed to be streamlined, simplified and better targeted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review found the principles of the EMDG scheme remained relevant and valued by exporters. Those core EMDG principles are retained in this bill which:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Will continue to provide financial support for eligible Australian exporters who produce substantially Australian products, whether they be goods or services.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Does not prioritise particular industries or export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Ensures a wide range of expenditure is eligible, reflecting that businesses approach markets in different ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Continues to focus assistance on promotional activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Provides access for SMEs to multi-year entitlements, reflecting the time it takes to build a presence in the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Ensures SMEs have 'skin in the game'â€”they will be provided with a proportion of their eligible expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Continues to provide for regular evaluation of the program. The review found that the current EMDG scheme, which reimburses exporters, provides no certainty about the level of government support prior to exporters' expenditure on promotional activities. Currently some exporters wait up to two years to receive reimbursements, with the level of funding unknown until after completion of their promotional activities. This is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will create up-front certainty for exporters about the level of government support. The bill changes EMDG from a reimbursement scheme to one which will see eligible SMEs entering up-front grant agreements that provide them with funding certainty over multiple years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review also recommended that EMDG recipients be export-ready to ensure the greatest impact and obtain the most value from the government's support. The bill removes the export performance test and the requirement that recipients have a prospect of success. This is replaced with the requirement that recipients be either ready to export or have already exported their products. It is not the business of the Australian government to be picking winners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review found that the government should continue to fund export focused industry bodies or alliances formed on behalf of members and that support should be expanded to include facilitating education and training of members to help them become export ready. The bill expands eligible activities to include training, to implement this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review also found that the EMDG scheme administration was too complex. We need to cut red tape and make it easier for SME exporters to apply. Accordingly, this bill modernises and streamlines the administration of EMDG. Currently the bulk of EMDG's administrative requirements are contained within the act. While the bill contains EMDG's core principles, it removes the detailed requirements on administrative matters, such as how to apply for grants and what information will need to be provided to support the application. These matters will be managed through administrative guidelines. The bill also removes the separate approval process for industry bodies and requirements about when expenses are incurred. Like any grant program, funding will now be agreed for activities prior to expenditure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the previous act, the bill also contains rule-making powers for the minister to establish the operational details for the program through the rules, a disallowable instrument. The rules will set the under-$20 million turnover threshold for eligible SMEs and the tiers of EMDG support for SMEs new-to-export and expanding exporters, as recommended by the review. While the bill establishes the EMDG as being for Australian exporters and for products that are substantially Australian, it is the rules that will elaborate on matters like the definition of eligible products and eligible expenses and deal with technical details such as the effect of foreign investment in an SME and disqualifying convictions for eligible persons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world moves at a faster pace than when the EMDG scheme started in 1975, and the new legislative structure will also allow the government to respond more quickly to rapidly changing markets and business practices and to unforeseen disruptions like COVID-19. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In streamlining EMDG administration, the bill focuses on the relationship, created through a grant agreement, between the Commonwealth and the EMDG recipient. The bill therefore removes the ability to compel third parties to provide information in support of the applicant. It also removes provisions related to other third parties, such as associates and consultants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mirroring Commonwealth grant agreements, the bill allows adjustments to be made to grant agreements should the amount appropriated for the EMDG program be reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforming EMDG will result in systems and administrative changes. To meet the cost of these reforms, the bill temporarily lifts the cap on EMDG administration expenses from five percent to 7.5 percent for financial year 2020-21 and to seven percent for financial year 2021-22, before returning to its previous cap of five percent for administration costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In implementing the review's recommendations, the government is confident that this bill will create a framework for a reoriented EMDG program that is simplified and streamlined to deliver financial assistance to SME exporters in the most effective and efficient way and in a way which will have the greatest impact. These reforms will both assist current SME exporters to recover from the effects of COVID-19 and grow the number of SME exporters, contributing to Australia's economic recovery and future economic growth and prosperity. I commend the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the Morrison government's tax plan for Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19 announced last night by the Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill delivers lower taxes for individuals and businesses. It will stimulate demand, support investment, boost economic growth and most importantly, create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, we are lowering taxes for more than 11 million individuals who pay personal income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax cuts support low- and middle-income Australians, with the majority of the benefit in 2020-21 being received by those on incomes below $90,000. In 2020-21, low- and middle-income earners will receive tax relief of up to $2,745, for singles, and up to $5,490, for dual income families, compared with 2017-18 settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next 12 months, personal income taxes will be cut by $12.5 billion. Taxes will be cut by $17.8 billion over the next four years. With more money in their pockets, Australians can spend more in our economy, boosting demand and jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personal income taxes will be cut by bringing forward the second stage of the government's Personal Income Tax Plan by two years to this financial year. This involves increasing the top threshold of the 19 per cent bracket from $37,000 to $45,000 and increasing the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent bracket from $90,000 to $120,000. Under stage 2, the low income tax offset increases from $445 to $700, which will ultimately deliver more money into the pockets of some of the lowest income-earning Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also provide an additional low and middle income tax offset, worth up to $1,080, in 2020-21 that would have been removed under stage 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It all forms part of our plan that ensures that by 2024-25, around 95 per cent of Australian income earners pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar, on every dollar they earn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do we need more Australians with more money in their pockets out there spending, we also need to back businesses that have a go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 economic recovery will be driven by private sector growth. Eight out of ten jobs are private sector jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why our Economic Recovery Plan includes substantial incentives for businesses to invest. This bill will provide 99 per cent of businesses access to temporary full expensing until 30 June 2022. This will reward business for bringing forward their investment. Businesses with a turnover up to $5 billion will be able to deduct the full cost of eligible depreciable assets of any value in the year they are first installed. Whether it is a family farm investing in a tractor, a cafe in a new coffee machine, a manufacturer in new machinery or a services business in IT software these investments will boost productivity and ultimately boost our economy. With more investment, there is more work to do and with that comes more jobs along the supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are many businesses, which were sound businesses before COVID-19, that are now in a loss making position. Under this bill, companies with a turnover of up to $5 billion will be able to apply their losses against profits taxed in a previous year as far back as the 2018â€‘19 income year. This temporary measure will be available until 2021-22. It will allow these businesses to access cash by using their losses now, to stay in business, rebuild and invest, rather than waiting until they return to profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in this bill, the Morrison government will invest a further $2 billion in businesses who invest in research and development, through the Research and Development Tax Incentive. Business investment in R&amp;D is central to the development of new products, processes and services that will help make Australia more competitive. Investing in R&amp;D provides jobs now and jobs for tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill implements measures contained in existing legislation before this parliament, with several enhancements. The enhancements increase the tax offset rates for all claimants of the R&amp;D tax incentive compared to the 2019 bill, remove the $4 million cap on annual cash refunds, streamline the intensity test from three to two tiers, and defer the start date of the changes to 1 July 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we know small business is the engine room of our economy. Under this legislation businesses with an aggregated annual turnover between $10 million and $50 million will, for the first time, have access to up to 10 small business tax concessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will cut their red tape, improve their cash flow and allow them to spend more time on their business than with the tax office. The changes are estimated to support around 20,000 businesses and their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

AWE currently occupies 39,077 square metres across three premises in Canberra. Following rigorous analysis of accommodation options, AWE has proposed to consolidate all Civic based staff from two premises into one tenancy, known as Civic Quarter 2. This project does not impact AWE's tenancy in the John Gorton Building in Canberra. This will reduce the total net lettable area for AWE by 6,037 square metres. The fit-out plans indicate that the proposed tenancy would have an occupational density of 12 square metres per occupied work point. The estimated cost of the works is $78 million, and it will be funded through a landlord incentive of $74 million and a departmental appropriation of $4 million.</span>

Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are expected to commence in February 2021 and occupation of the building is scheduled for between August and September of 2022.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment goes to the government's performance on biosecurity more generally. Specific to this bill, many if not most Australians will be very familiar with the process of completing an incoming passenger declaration card when they're coming back into the country, whether by air or by sea. I suspect that many Australians take a fairly blase if not cynical approach to this declaration. It's just another burden upon them as they enter the country, usually feeling quite tired after overseas work or travel. But I think everyone in this place would fully understand how important that declaration is in protecting our biosecurity in this country and, in the case of this bill in particular, our farming sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our biosecurity system is probably not one that is well understood by Australiansâ€”or anyone listening who might not even know what 'biosecurity' means. Of course, we are talking about what we used to call quarantine, making sure pest and disease doesn't enter our island continent. Being an island continent gives us a very significant advantage in that regard, particularly in the agriculture sector, but it doesn't mean we don't have to continue to work very, very hard to maintain our relatively clean and safe image. Since reports that were done some years ago, we now look at biosecurity quite differently. We think beyond the border a lot, making sure we're dealing with threats to our biosecurity before they come to our shores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the passenger declaration is very important. For example, a woodcarving, which might look very innocent to a tourist or someone returning from working overseas, could be carrying beetles, termites or larvae that are not obvious to the human eye. A seafood product could contain something like white spot disease, which nearly wiped out our prawn industry in Queensland not all that long ago. Red meat brought in could be carrying an exotic disease that would pose a big threat to our red meat sector. A plant, for example, could be carrying an aphid, and people would not be aware of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is very important that people fill out these declaration cards honestly. Sadly, that is not always the caseâ€”again, not because people are being deliberately sinister in most cases but because they think that whatever they're carrying is surely not a big issue. It looks pretty safe to them and they prefer not to declare it because, as we all know, once you declare a good you might spend a little bit more time getting through the regulatory and inspection process than you would if you did not declare it. So, the objective of this bill is to increase penalties to raise awareness and hopefully make people more reluctant to make a false declaration on that card. I won't go through the numbers on the penalty increasesâ€”the minister has done thatâ€”but they are very substantial and hopefully they will raise community awareness of the threats and also make people more likely to make a true declaration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support that approach. Biosecurity is of course a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states, and it is a very important measure on the part of the Commonwealth. I am a little bit concerned about whether the government has extended additional training to biosecurity officers, who will have the difficult job of imposing higher on-the-spot fines in an airport, for example. That is something that is not easy to handle, if you've got an energetic and aggressive incoming passenger who is not happy about that fine. We want to make sure this job is done properly and accurately and we want to make sure our workforce has the appropriate training and is ready to deal with what might be some difficult situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are a few things about biosecurity that we can all agree on in this place. I've mentioned oneâ€”shared responsibility with the statesâ€”but there should also be shared responsibility with industry and of course with the broader community, which has a big role to play, and this is the main point of this bill. We can also agree that we must take that pre-border approach, which I mentioned earlier, and we must all agree that the system must be risk based. In other words, we cannot hope to have a zero-risk approach to quarantine. That would be impossible, even for an island continent like Australia. It needs to be risk based. And the initiatives we take in dealing with the level of risk apparent have to be cost-effective and of course have to be science based.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we can all agree that it is the responsibility of all of us to make sure our biosecurity system is an effective one. Because it's a Commonwealth-state responsibility, we now have a thing called an <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergovernmental agreement on biosecurity</span> to ensure that the Commonwealth and the states are going in the same direction and working together to get the job done. We do have an intergovernmental agreement, and it's an agreement that does come under review every five years. That is a good thing, because the situation both here and abroad is changing on a regular basis and, of course, threats change. We need to have a constant review to see that both the Commonwealth and the states are up to the mark and they're working as cooperatively and effectively as is possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had one of those reviews headed by an independent panel, chaired by Wendy Craik. It was a very substantial review, and I think a good review, that provided a good explanation of both the system, its shortfalls, and where we can do better. Unfortunately, that review has, in part, been gathering dust. Its recommendations were significant. Many of them, the Commonwealth can say, go to the responsibility of the states or at least joint efforts, but at least 10 of them are solely the responsibility of the Commonwealth. People will now be asking how many. I suggest it's about 10. Then people will be asking how many of those 10 recommendations of the Craik review have been embraced and implemented by this government. I can report it's four. In three years, of those 10 recommendations from the Craik reviewâ€”that go to the heart of the Commonwealth's responsibilityâ€”only four have been responded to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give some examples, they are things like asking the government to assign lead responsibility for driving and coordinating implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ommunity </span><span style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span style="font-style:italic;">iosecurity </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">esearch, </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">evelopment and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xtension </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">trategy 2016 to 2019</span>.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of dot points demonstrating how that should be increased. Interestingly, this is one that was the focus of some media attention, because the recommendation was that a $10 per 20-foot equivalent unit and a levy of $5 on incoming sea and air containers should be implemented, to raise the funds needed, to give the system the resources necessary to give us confidence in our biosecurity system. That levy has never been embraced and implemented. The government had a couple of goes at it and, embarrassingly, was sent packing by industryâ€”mainly because the government had, clearly, turned it into a revenue-raising exercise rather than a package designed to bolster our biosecurity system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all those years the government kicked it down the road, beyond the 2019 election, declaring it all too hard and then, post election, it just gave up the ghost. It says that it's funding the same initiatives it had identified, that would be funded under the levy. We're yet to determine that with any great certainty. It's for the government to demonstrate to industry it's done just that. There's not much point in doing a comprehensive review of the IGAB, the intergovernmental agreement, if you're not going to pursue the recommendations. We should have ongoing reviews of the system, but we have those reviews. We need to pursue them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect it's reasonable to say that the work of an agriculture minister is dominated by biosecurity. In the short time I was in that position, I would assess that 60 per cent of my work was taken by biosecurity issues. Obviously, they're very critical. Australia's reputation on global markets is, in very large part, based on our reputation as a provider of clean, green, safe food, and we can't maintain that reputation if we don't ensure to the rest of the world that we are clean, green and safe. In any case, our yields would become very much under threat if pests and disease got into our country and wiped out our product here. Even one-tenth of a crop or stock would make a huge difference to our agricultural sector, but we've seen examples in other countries where whole industries have basically been wiped out because of the incursion of pests and disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has, or should have, heightened our awareness about the importance of a very sound biosecurity system, because we've seen the possibility of having exports of inputs cut, whether they're inputs for production or finished goods coming into this country, which highlights our awareness about the need to be self-sufficient as we can. We often say, rightly or wrongly, that we can never have a food security issue in Australia, because we export two-thirds of everything we produce. In other words, as a country of 25 million people, we feed about 70 to 75 million people in total. While that seems to be common sense, one-third of nothing is nothing, so, if we were to have a problem which caused us to be denied our local production and if we weren't able to import significant quantities of food then we could have a very, very significant food security issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has also reminded us about the risk of having our ways of communications blocked and what that would mean for our fuel securityâ€”something that's very critical to our farmersâ€”and our medicines, not just for human beings but for stock. We are very heavily dependent on the importation of animal medicines. The weather is changing in most challenging ways, and that should raise our awareness of the extent to which we are reliant on imported product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Biosecurity is very, very important. And, on the issue of chemicals, moving away from animal medicines, it is very true that we are heavily dependent on the import of product, such as the chemicals that our farmers so desperately need, particularly from China. In fact, we're now at risk of losing the last manufacturer of the critical ingredient necessary for many of the chemical products our farmers rely upon. That means that soon, if nothing changes, we'll be 100 per cent dependent on that active ingredient, which should be a warning sign to us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before I rose to my feet, the various ministers were introducing bills relevant to the budget last night. I haven't had an opportunity, having looked at the macro of the budget and what's happening in my own electorate, to have a deep look at what the government has said about the agricultural sector. I will certainly do that throughout the course of the day, and I will do so with great attention to detail. I think what's missing still from the government in agriculture is an overarching narrative and the strategic guidance necessary to demonstrate to the sector that the government has a plan for the sector and has the will to provide the guidance to ensure that the sector does hit that $100 billion farm gate value that the government talks about so often. I'd like to think $100 billion is still achievable, but it's going to be more difficult now with the impact of COVIDâ€”that is, both the impact already and the impact that is going to flow over a number of years. It's okay for the National Farmers Federation to set the $100 billion, and we've been very supportive of that. It's not so necessary for them to give the detailed road map to $100 billion, but it is necessary for the government, if it's going to support the $100 billion, to provide that policy guidance, and it has not done so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were promised back in 2013, seven years ago, that the government would produce a white paper to give us that strategic guidance. I had a good chat with the member for New England at the time, as he was the agricultural minister. I basically begged him to use, as a foundation, the former Labor government's National Food Plan and further build upon that to provide the guidance the sector needs and is looking for. Unfortunately, as I've said in this place many times before, the 2015 white paper was a failure. It was more a collection of ideas, thought bubbles and failed projects than a document providing the strategic guidance that the sector needs to get to that $100 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the current minister make a speech at a CropLife breakfast this morning. I thought I was listening to Barnaby Joyce seven years ago. Nothing changes. There were plenty of cliches. It was short on policy, short on ideas and certainly short on guidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agriculture sector in Australia is not without challenges. We have very limited natural resourcesâ€”soil and water. We're the driest inhabited continent in the world. Our good soil resources are limited to a relatively small proportion of our continent. As I said earlier, our climate is changing in challenging ways, putting further pressure on those natural resources. Historically we have overproduced on much of our quality land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we are short on capital resources, which is why we have been so heavily dependent on foreign capital over all of our lifetime. Traditionally it came from places like Canada, the UK and New Zealand, but increasingly it's now from Asian markets, including China. We in this parliament need to have a real think about the extent to which we facilitate China's investment, because it will be critical to the success of securing that $100 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Taylor was one of the key authors of a report that said that to be successful mid-century we'll need about $600 billion of capital investment in agriculture related infrastructure in this country. We will not get there if we don't secure more community support, have a better understanding and do more to facilitate foreign investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we are short on human resources. This has been dramatically highlighted by COVID-19. We have an agriculture sector that is heavily reliant on foreign labourâ€”up to 50,000 foreign workers every year. That's not new; that has been a growing problem over a decade or more. We have to ask ourselves whether that's a healthy proposition to be perpetuating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a short-term solution. The government promised an ag visa and then unpromised an ag visa. It then promised an ag visa and unpromised it again. Since then we've seen nothing of any great merit that addresses the problem in the short to medium term. We also need a long-term plan to reduce that reliance. COVID-19 has demonstrated to us how serious it is for the sector when the supply of foreign labour is cut off. That is not a sustainable proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a sector in which 80 per cent of the production comes from 20 per cent of the firms. Productivity has been flatlining for at least a decade. Profitability is, on average, low. According to the ABS, the majority aren't really making a profit. We have limited capital resources, limited human resources, limited natural resources, the climate moving against us and COVID-19 still hanging around. Hopefully, this is the last serious virus we see in a long time. Yet at breakfast this morning the minister said: 'Everything is okay. We're on track to reach $100 billion by 2030.' I beg to differ, given the current structure of the sector and the trajectory it is on at the moment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all despite the best efforts of our growers and producers. There's no criticism of them. They're working within the system that the government is prepared to accept as being good enough. Of course we've had barley producers and others impacted by the decisions of the government of China. From the government there has been no real response that is credible and is likely to have a great impact on that situation. It's a structure and a situation normal that can't be left alone if the government is to have any hope of putting the sector on that $100 billion trajectory. Critical to that will be research and development, and innovation and extension. It's something this government's been talking about for seven years but has done nothing about. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We went to the last election making very clear that we are very proud of the 30-year-old research and development corporation structure that a Labor government put in place under John Kerin. But we also made the point repeatedly that it is a 30-year-old structure that is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and is not delivering the efficient outcomes that our agriculture sector needs right now. We promised a significant redesign of that system to rid us of the top-heavy situation we have in our RDCs, to get more cross-sectoral work going, to stop the siloing and to get people more focused on extensionâ€”in other words, to get the innovation inside the farm gate. After a little while, Minister Littleproud decided he might start agreeing with that proposition, and, particularly after the election, started making noises to that effect. But, in fact, pre the election, the minister decidedâ€”</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much. I know members opposite, particularly the member for Mackellar, don't like hearing the truth and don't like hearing me talking about their inadequacies in farming over seven years. But, if he had any energy in him at all and did his homework, he'd know I moved a second reading amendment, which I think he might refer to,which might reinforce your very good ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did Mr Littleproud decide to do pre the election? He decided to have a review. Under this government, we've had so many reviews in the agriculture sector that, if I put the reports in my office, one on one, they would hit the ceiling. Those opposite love a committee, they love a reviewâ€”they love revisiting these thingsâ€”but they never do anything. They announce and forget. But how much did this review cost? How much did it cost the taxpayer to arrive at the same conclusions that I'd offered years in advance? Two point seven million dollars went to EYâ€”$2.7 million to tell us that the 30-year-old system had run its course and needed to be fixed. Sadly, it didn't really tell us how it should be fixed, by the way. It was helicopter-high level in its approach; it didn't provide any practical solutions to be immediately embraced by the government. But it got Minister Littleproud through the election. He was having another review. Well, how long ago was the electionâ€”16, 17 months? What do you think the minister did in the budget last night? He did not allocate another $2.7 million: 2.7 became 7.2. They flipped the number. If they were going to spend $7.2 million restructuring our research and development capacity in the agriculture sector and they were going to spend it straightaway, maybe you wouldn't mindâ€”at least they would be finally going to do something. But, no; it is $7.2 million over four years. Think about that. If they spend $7.2 million over four years and get the job done in four years, it will have been 11 yearsâ€”11 yearsâ€”since the election of the government before they have done anything. Based on experience, it would be a great leap of faith to believe they will do anything in four years, but that's their plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they've established some entity, AIA or somethingâ€”I forget what it's calledâ€”that is going to work within the council of RDCs to do what I've been calling on the government to do all these years. I don't know what the council of RDCs has been doing or should be doing that is now going to be done by yet another entity, but there will be more money involved, Mr Deputy Speaker Gillespie; you can be sure of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have emerging international competition in grains, from the Black Sea countries, and in red meat, from the South American countries; and freight rates are falling, so they're getting closer to the Asian market. If we're going to lift productivity and improve our profitability and competitiveness, we will need a heavy focus on research and innovation. The minister was talking about that this morning at the public breakfast. But talking about it is not enough. We've been talking about it for too long. It's time for action. We don't want to wait another four years. We don't want to unnecessarily spend another $7.2 million of taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, the minister was also talking about regulatory regimes. In fact, in one area, he's going to spend $70 million facilitating approvals et cetera for exporters. Great! I'm all for improving access for exporters. This review here in my handâ€”another reviewâ€”is the report of the Productivity Commission inquiry into regulation of Australian agriculture, which, again, was announced with great fanfare at the time by this governmentâ€”a big announcement! Remember, they had 'red-tape reduction day'? Well, this was just one portfolio. This review, and it's almost 700 pages, is a good review. I had a briefing from the authors and I congratulated them on the report, and I looked forward at that timeâ€”in 2016, four years agoâ€”to the report being embraced. But, of course, it has largely been gathering dust. Most of the responses from the government basically say, 'It's a matter for the states.' Well, get your terms of reference right, I would say. But, again, if we're going to improve our international competitiveness and, therefore, our profitability, we need to reduce the regulatory burden on business. The minister seems to have put a bit of money into it last night, but I will be very surprised if we get any significant economic outcome from anything that he said last night.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a serious look at a sector in which, as I said, 80 per cent of the output comes from 20 per cent of the firms, so profitability is isolated amongst the few; our natural resources are not only limited and misallocated but further challenged by a changing climate; our human resources are so low; and, of course, our capital resources are nothing like those needed to provide the infrastructure to lift that productivity and that competitiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the billâ€”no problem with that. But I do hope, still, that the government, after seven years of doing nothing, might start becoming seriousâ€”not pitch for votes but become seriousâ€”about the structure of the industry, and the role of government in providing guidance to the sector about where it needs to go to arrive at that $100 billion target, and, having set that guidance, providing the support it needs to be successful.</span>

Now some might say I'm saying this just because he happens to live on the northern beaches of Sydney and may or may not vote for me and because my pursuit of any vote is relentless. I suspect there are easier votes to get than that of the brother of the member for Lyons, but that will not deter me.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, more than ever before, the importance of biosecurity is at the forefront of our minds, with COVID-19 impacting upon the lives of all Australians. Biosecurity related to food and agricultural produce is equally critical in protecting consumers, exporters and farmers. As we create a bioresilient economy, a unified vision for national security is critical to our future prosperity and in supporting those in the agricultural sector who have endured so much hardship in recent times. Our biosecurity system underpins $60 billion in agricultural production, $49 billion in agricultural exports and $42 billion in inbound tourism. The flow-on effects of this are incalculable, and the importance of these industries both to our national economy and to many regional communities cannot be understated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of this bill is creating a more proportionate response to infringements by travellers when they bring undeclared goods to Australia. The infringements will reference the kinds of goods, their classification and the nature of the biosecurity risk they represent. This bill permits the Director of Biosecurity to determine what goods should attract a higher infringement associated with those items. We cannot overemphasise the importance of protecting our natural environment or our farmers. After the difficulties posed by both drought and fire, this government will do whatever it takes to help our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An additional component of this bill is indexing the current infringement notice to $440, which equates to two penalty units. Depending on the nature of the infringement, more penalty units will applyâ€”up to 12 penalty units, which will incur a fine of $12,264 after indexation, or 60 penalty units subject to civil penalty proceedings in court. Failure by foreign travellers, airline crew or Australians to declare goods is a national threat, one that we are combating with these additional measures, given its severity. We will not wait for disaster to strike before implementing stringent biosecurity legislation but will be taking a proactive approach, as prevention is the most efficient way to manage this kind of threat. Of particular concern is African swine fever, which is contagious and is estimated to cost, if it comes to Australia, over $2 billion over a five-year periodâ€”making the fines appear not that great. We cannot allow the careless actions of individuals to put at risk the livelihoods of so many Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2018 to 2019, biosecurity officers issued an average of 410 infringement notices a month at Australian airports. The forecast for 2019-20, before COVID restrictions were put in place, was more than 820 per month. Unfortunately, even this underestimated the reality, with 1,139 infringement notices issued in January 2020 alone, representing an increase of around 30 per cent on the forecast. The impact on biosecurity was growing and, until COVID restrictions, the number of people trying to get past airport security without declaring high-risk goods was also increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is urgent and should be the first step in constructing a strong and unified system which screens both agricultural goods and people for pathogens and biosecurity threats. Failure to do so not only will decimate Australian agriculture but will put lives at risk. The responsibility of passengers and crew to declare goods remains the same. This bill changes only the infringements and matches the risk of the goods with the infringement. It does not impose additional requirements on passengers, airlines, exporters or businesses. Changes will be published in conjunction with additional training for biosecurity officers and Australian Border Force officers, which is estimated to take two to three months. Redeployment of officers following COVID, when borders reopen, has been taken into account when creating a time line for implementation, along with ICT system updates. Having an infringement system without adequate enforcement measures will be ineffective, which is why we are investing heavily in upgrading our airport infrastructure to support this amendment. Deploying advanced detection 3D X-rays, which also use algorithm technology, is an encouraging example of the measures we are taking to safeguard our borders. Increasing our use of screening technology will remain central, particularly as we seek to detect meat, fruit and high-risk bio matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing to utilise big data in allocating our biosecurity resources and identifying ways we can improve our processes by establishing a national biosecurity data and analytics platform. In sharing biosecurity data, we will be able to enhance our capacity to identify security risks and take corrective action. We are allocating $36Â½ million in funding to develop this platform. COVID has shown us that we cannot rely on other countries or global institutions to safeguard our interests, and that responsibility for our national biosecurity is on us alone. That is why we cannot cut corners when it comes to funding our border security. Small agribusinesses rely on a stable and safe environment and, as a source of jobs, growth and future innovation, getting our biosecurity right is a must.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about providing a proportionate compliance response for people, regardless of citizenship, who fail to declare goods with a biosecurity risk. All first points of entry, including sea ports, will be included in these changes; however, particular attention will be given to biosecurity processes in airports, due to the high volume of travellers. In the last financial year, we invested $850 million in this area, and we'll continue to support frontline personnel in keeping our country safe. Creating a regulatory environment that maximises the competitiveness of Australian businesses whilst giving adequate protection to our farmers and the environment remains central to this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the extensive consultation with industry and across multiple departments, this is a solution designed to be flexible to change. As it stands, the penalties do not accurately reflect the risk of the offence and, given this disconnect, often underpenalises some offenders. To have a penalty which disregards the nature of the offence and does not correspond to the level of infringement is, quite simply, bad policy. Given it costs nothing to declare goods, there is no reason why any visitor or returning resident should be trying to avoid declaring what they are carrying. The bill improves the penalty scheme by linking them with the degree of danger the infringement poses to the community. The different classifications which they are based off will be determined using a technical risk assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the smarter regulation agenda, this bill does not create any additional red tape or impose any more requirements on travellers coming to Australia. We do need a tight border policy, but the responsibility to implement that policy, its costs and burden should not be shifted to business or individuals. Compliance for all parties involved should be seamless and, in making the process both accurate and efficient, we should make the most of automation in processing high volumes of travellers. Being able to do this will be especially important for our tourism industry, where a positive experience makes a large impact. Doing this without cutting corners when it comes to our biosecurity is critical, which is why in this field we are seeking to be world leaders when it comes to border protection. The measures outlined in this bill have been taken in place of alternatives, which came at a significant regulatory impact on industry and those seeking to remain compliant. As a government, we seek to ensure that all departments implementing regulatory changes must co-design processes with industry working groups. Smarter regulation is light touch, highly automated and reduces the burden on small businesses so they can focus on what they do best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country with one of the most pristine and untouched environments, we are fortunate not to have many of the biohazards that countries in the rest of the world have to contend with. This is a natural competitive advantage for our businesses in agriculture, but it can easily be lost if we are careless and fail to create the protective measures required to safeguard our farmers and consumers. Bills like this pave the way for a post-COVID era where a premium is placed on biosecurity and ease of compliance for businesses. We are leading the way by relying on technological solutions for these issues. And when government invests in the tech sphereâ€”particularly in reg-tech, or regulation technology, and innovative security solutionsâ€”we are supporting an industry that will be in demand for the future. Australian technology firms are important creators of jobs, innovation and growth. Establishing a biosecurity innovation program with an initial $25.2 million in government funding will be a strong first step in this program. Whilst a lot of attention is rightly given to the cybersecurity space, there is abundant opportunity in biosecurity where demand will only be growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage the newly established Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis to engage with the innovation and tech hubs throughout Australia as they develop risk analysis tools. As part of the government's ongoing commitment to our biosecurity, we are establishing a dedicated office to support the work of the Chief Environmental Biosecurity Officer. In creating a unified and efficient system for our biosecurity, we are enacting our long-term strategic vision. This legislation is a critical step in adopting a systematic process for identifying and planning for national priority biohazards. Taking measures to manage these risks is essential in facilitating the trade that we rely on for our economic prosperity. For these reasons, I highly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  Tasmanians take biosecurity seriously. Whether the threat is from fruit fly or coronavirus, we like to keep the bad bugs out. Even for a small state like Tasmania, it's no easy task. We're helped by having a big moat, but we still have multiple points of entry by sea and by air. Travellers are greeted at airport gates by beagles eager to sniff you and your bags, and we have big signs warning of the dire consequences for those who try to sneak in their contraband bananas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, more than 4.2 million people flew into Hobart, Launceston and Devonport airports, and another 200,000 arrived on cruise ships. More than 230,000 containers and 15.5 million tonnes of freight came into our state. Before COVID hit, the numbers were only getting bigger. Examples of things intercepted by Tasmanian biosecurity officers include turtles, a gecko from Noumea, a stink bug from France and salmon from Denmark. Yes, someone tried to bring Danish salmon into Tasmaniaâ€”a bit like taking a bag of ice from the servo to Antarctica! On one flight from mainland Australia, biosecurity officers discovered 10 kilos of fish and seafood products in a passenger's checked baggage. We wouldn't have wanted that plane to have been delayed on the tarmac on a hot day. Another time, officers found bags of tamarind, soybeans, leafy greens and unidentified fruit on a flight from interstate. That package was infested with live ants and larvae. Of course, there are more common items such as flowers, plants, seeds, edible items and fruit. There are millions of travellers, millions of tonnes of freight and, in relative terms, a handful of biosecurity officers standing guard. I take my hat off to each and every one of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that in 2018 federal Labor and Tasmanian Labor committed $5.7 million to recruit an extra 20 officers in Tasmania. Sadly, that did not come about. But, for every idiot or criminal that these biosecurity officers intercept, for every bag of larvae infested salad greens they catch, how many are making it through? We know that across Australia in 2018-19, biosecurity officers issued, on average, 410 infringement notices every month or just under 5,000 a year. Compare that with the tens of millions of passenger arrivals and it doesn't take a genius to work out that there is a lot of raw pork and dodgy seafood coming into the country undetected. With passenger and freight numbers expected to soar 70 per cent in the next five years, the challenge is only getting bigger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that effective biosecurity takes moneyâ€”real money. Smart governments know that good biosecurity is insurance. You close your eyes, you hold your nose, you sign the cheque and you pay the premium, year in, year out. You complain about the cost, but you know that the risk is too great not to carry the insurance. Stupid governments cut corners. They shave off a few dollars here and there on biosecurity, hoping no-one notices. They cut shifts, they reduce staffing, they outsource. They hedge that the risks are low enough to do it. But, of course, it is a false economy. All it takes is one outbreak, just a small one, and then, to clean up the mess, you have to spend many multiples of the few dollars you have saved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania had the lived example of this when our state Liberal government cut its biosecurity budget to save a million or two. A short time later, we had a fruit fly outbreak that threatened our horticulture industry. The measures put in place to isolate and eradicate the outbreak were costly and time-consuming both for the taxpayer and for growers in affected areas, who were told they could not move their produce to market. It's farmers who end up paying the heavy price when governments fail their biosecurity obligations. More recently, Tasmania has suffered a biosecurity failure of another kind. Despite Prime Minister Morrison's declaring that cruise ships were banned from Australia because of the coronavirus risk, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> was allowed to dock in Sydney and more than 2,500 passengers were allowed to disembark without undergoing any assessment or any checks. Those passengers wandered throughout the country, taking the virus with them, including to the north-west of Tasmania, which suffered a heavy, devastating and lethal toll in the early days of the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in the past week or so Tasmanians have learnt of a new biosecurity threatâ€”not from foreign shores, but from South Australia. The Tasmanian Liberal government quietly allowed a big South Australian producer, Mitolo, entry into the Tasmanian whole potato market, with no consultation with the public and no consultation with Tasmanian growers, who contribute $400 million annually to the state's economy. Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Vegetable chair, Nathan Richardson, said the approval posed several risks. On 24 September, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Examiner</span> quoted Mr Richardson as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This announcement is shocking; there has been zero consultation with the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Richardson said that the approval did not take into account end-of-life use of the imported potatoes. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we could see is potatoes grown in the garden, or in a compost, where diseases could flourish and spread to the commercial crop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision puts at risk the contracts that Tasmanian growers have in place with lucrative export markets, which prize Tasmania's status for disease-free potatoes. Mr Richardson hit the nail on the head when he said, as quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Examiner</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'A few years ago we had a fruit fly outbreak, and a few years before that it was blueberry rust,' he said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'What happened in those outbreaks is we thought everyone was doing the right thing, but they weren't, and the Tasmanian industry paid for it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has not done much in the biosecurity space in its seven years on the Treasury benches, despite its revolving door of agriculture ministers sprouting from the farmers' party, the Nationals. It has promised a lot but it has delivered hardly anything. That sounds familiar: all slogan, no solution; all headline, no story. It's the story of this government and this Prime Minister: talk big, do little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today, for example, is worthy of support, but it's just good housekeeping. It increases penalties for idiots and criminals who breach biosecurity laws and it empowers the director to make some penalties heavier than others, depending on the severity of the breach, without having to seek legislative approval. We are supporting it, but not before we say a few things about how this government has been failing Australia's biosecurity challenge. As the deputy chair of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources, I often talk to farmers and others involved in primary production. Along with access to water and the impacts of climate change biosecurity is often cited as the most important issue confronting Australian agriculture and yet it remains woefully under-resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 Wendy Craik was given the task by this government of reviewing our national biosecurity systems, with the goal that her report would inform any changes necessary to the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity. She handed down 10 recommendations, of which only four have been implemented. One outcome was an announcement that the federal and state and territory governments would come together to create a cohesive national biosecurity system. We've seen how well national coordination on biosecurity goes under this government with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. The Craik review makes it clear that resourcing and funding are biosecurity's greatest weaknesses. So this government did what it generally does, it tried to offload its responsibility onto somebody else. Just like the Prime Minister tried to offload his responsibility for borders onto New South Wales, the government tried to offload its responsibility for biosecurity onto freight operators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government said it would introduce an industry levy that would raise $325 million over three years. In May this year it abandoned the levy, earning some brickbats along the way for the uncertainty that it had created. The National Farmers Federation CEO, Tony Mahar, described the decision as a blow to Australian farmers and a poor look for the government. Critically, the government has not proposed an alternative model to better resource biosecurity. If the levy is going to be raising $100 million a year to improve biosecurity, what is the government's plan to find that money? Yesterday's budget certainly provided no comfort to farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association recently reported that even a small outbreak of foot and mouth disease, lasting just three months, would cost the Australian economy more than $7 billion. A 12-month outbreak would cost more than $16 billion. Tens of billions of agricultural dollars are at stake and this government can't get its act together to find even $100 million a year to protect our crops from threats. The prevention of agricultural disease deserves to be a national priority and it's time this government took that responsibility seriously.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I'm pleased to be speaking on the Biosecurity Amendment (Traveller Declarations and Other Measures) Bill 2020 today, because this bill is all about protecting Australian agriculture. As someone who grew up on a farm, and whose parents are still actively farming in the south-east of South Australia, this is a matter very dear to my heart. My mum and dad grow beef, lamb and wool, and we live in a part of South Australia that's quite close to the coast so we have a very important fishing industry there as well, which is mainly cray fishing. All of these products are critical to Australia's exports, critical to jobs and critical to our national income and economy, which is why we need to make sure that we do everything in our power to keep our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries as safe as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian farmers, as we know, produce some of the best food and fibre products in the world. Our food products are also some of the safest in the world. They're produced under very careful environmental controls with stringent conditions on things like the use of chemicals and veterinary products. We have very careful and stringent protections for our natural environment in terms of water, native vegetation and native wildlife. We have very careful rules around wild catch harvest, for example, as well. Our fishing industry has led the world in terms of protecting our fish stocks and carefully managing and protecting fisheries with quotas and sanctuary zones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike most other Western countries, our farmers are not paid by the government to farm. They're not protected by tariffs and subsidies. They are at very much at the whim of the market, and so have to be innovative and have to be able to adapt and change in response to market conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, Australia is a big island, and, as a big island, we are incredibly lucky to have very few pests and diseases that can impact our agricultural, forestry and fisheries industries and products. As the federal government, we work very hard to make sure we keep it that way. That's why we're introducing this bill, to keep our nation free of exotic and hugely dangerous and damaging pests and diseases that could easily destroy our agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries. We need to be vigilant in order to protect Australia from an ever-increasing number of pests and diseases that threaten our industries, and biosecurity is critical to doing that. Pests such as the brown marmorated stink bug, which has the potential to decimate crops and do untold damage to our natural environment, post a continuing threat. Other diseases, such as African swine feverâ€”which I know is front of mind for many producers at the momentâ€”has strains that kill almost every pig infected, and this would cripple our $1.2 billion pork industry as well as threaten our trade, environment and economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of pork, anyone out there listening or watching at the moment, please remember to always check the label on your pork products, especially ham and bacon, to make sure you're buying Australian, because, unlike pork producers in literally every other nation in the world, our pork producers are not supported by government tariffs and subsidies. So, please do everything you can to support our Australian farmers and buy Aussie pork. To protect all our Australian farmers, the Morrison government is investing millions of dollars into preventing pests and diseases from entering Australia, but we need every single person who is coming into our country to do the right thing and to do their bit when they come into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to amend the Biosecurity Act 2015 to ensure a proportionate and effective compliance response through the targeted setting of infringement notice amounts to deter noncompliance. In other words, if you do the wrong thing you will be punished, and there will be a financial penalty. This bill changes the regulation-making power so that infringement notices may be issued for different but set amounts for an alleged contravention of the Biosecurity Act and for different periods of time to pay. These different amounts and times to pay may be specified by matters including reference to the kinds of goods or classes of goods that the alleged contravention relates to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will permit the director of biosecurity to make a legislative instrument that lists goods or classes of goods that attract a higher infringement notice amount than currently available. In making this instrument the director must be reasonably satisfied that there is a high level of biosecurity risk associated with the goods. Currently, incoming passengers and crew, including persons in charge of an aircraft or vessel, who fail to declare goods may receive an infringement notice in the amount of two penalty units, which is currently $444. The effect of this bill will be to enable an infringement notice to be issued for up to 12 penalty units, currently $2,664. So, that's a big increase in the fine that you will attract if you do the wrong thing, when incoming passengers and crew allegedly fail to declare goods listed in the legislative instrument. The law applies to all Australian citizens and anyone else coming into our nation. So, it's not just for citizens; it's for any traveller coming into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate why this bill is so important and why protecting Australian agriculture is such an important issue. The key reason is that agriculture is a really big employer. Hundreds of thousands of Australiansâ€”in fact, over 330,00 Australiansâ€”are employed in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. And that's before we even get to the value-added processing that happens through our food manufacturing industry, for example, and before we get to the indirect employment provided by agriculture, whether it's farmers going into their local towns and shopping at the supermarket or the newsagent, getting their farm supplies locally or employing a truck driver from time to time throughout the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just in terms of jobs. Australian agriculture is also critically important to our national economy. The gross value of Australian agriculture was $60 billion in 2018-19, despite the significant drought conditions that we saw around the nation. The total gross value of crops in this financial year rose one per cent, to $30 billionâ€”again, despite drought conditions. I want to go through the value of each of our different industries so that people have a really clear idea of what we are protecting when we make sure that we have strong biosecurity rules and that we all follow those rules when we come into Australia. Wheat is worth $6 billion; fruit and nuts, $5 billion; vegetables, $4 billion; barley, $3 billion; cotton, $1 billion; canola, $1 billion; and rice, $34 million. Our livestock is worth around $31 billion a year, gross value, to the Australian economy. In 2018-19 cattle and calves were worth $13 billion to our national economy; sheep and lambs, $4 billion; pigs, $1 billion; and wool, milk and eggs, $10 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So every time people do the wrong thing, when they come into Australia and don't declare things that they shouldn't be bringing in, they put at risk hundreds of thousands of jobs and $60 billion of income for our nation. It's so important that people do the right thing and follow the rules, and the rules are really easy to follow. If you've ever been overseas, you'll be very familiar with the incoming passenger card. It's the yellow card that you're given when you're on the plane, or even on a boat, coming into Australia, and it gives you a really clear list of things that you need to declare to make sure that you're not putting Australia at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The card asks whether you're bringing into Australia the following things: meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy, fruit, vegetables, grains, seeds, bulbs, straw, nuts, plants, parts of plants, traditional medicine, herbs or wooden articles. It asks you if you're bringing in animals, parts of animals, animal products (including equipment), pet food, eggs, biological specimens, birds, fish, insects, shells or bee products, and it also asks you if you have any items that might have soil on them that have been used in freshwater areas or if you've been in contact with farms, farm animals or wilderness areas in the past 30 days. There is more detailed information on what you can and can't bring into Australia on the department of agriculture website. If you've got any further inquiries, I encourage you to jump online and inform yourself of what you can and can't bring into Australia, so that we keep our farmers safe. If you visit www.agriculture.gov.au/travelling/bringing-mailing-goods you'll see the full list, item by item, of what you can and can't safely bring into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we know that a lot of people are still doing the wrong thing, which is why this bill is necessary. Anyone who has watched Channel 7's program <span style="font-style:italic;">Border Security - Australia's Front Line</span> will have seen people doing the wrong thing, trying to bring into Australia some really interesting goods that would have a devastating effect on our fisheries and our agriculture if they were to be consumed or to get into our natural environment. There's no excuse for this, because, as I just read out, the border entry card is completely clear about what you do and don't have to declare when you're coming in and what you can and can't bring in. In 2018-19, biosecurity officers issued an average of 410 infringement notices a month at Australian airports. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit our nation, in January 2020 this had risen to 1,139. That's a lot of people doing the wrong thing. That is a lot of people putting our fishers and our farmers at risk, putting $60 billion of Australian agricultural products at risk and putting over 330,000 direct agricultural jobs at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this bill is necessary. It sends a strong message to incoming passengers and crew that they need to declare biosecurity risk goods when they enter Australia. The beauty of this is that it costs you nothing to declare. If you are in doubt, just make a declaration on your incoming passenger card and ask our wonderful biosecurity frontline staff whether you're allowed to bring it in or not. It doesn't cost you a cent. It may cost you a tiny bit of time, but it's far better to spend those extra couple of minutes making sure what you're bringing in is safe to bring in than risk our $60 billion agricultural industry or risk a significant fine for yourself. It's when you don't declare and when you are found to have something that is not allowed into Australia that you will be detected and you will receive an infringement notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have wonderful border security officers and staff keeping Australians safe from exotic pests and diseases, and they do this in a range of ways. They have detector dogs, they have 2D and 3D X-ray technology and they screen everyone's baggage coming in, especially if they suspect that you might have something you shouldn't. So, rest assured, you are at great risk of being caught if you don't declare properly or if you try to bring things in that you shouldn't. I believe we have over 40 sniffer dogs in our airports, working constantly to make sure that people are not trying to bring in things they shouldn't. They do a wonderful job detecting meat, fruit, vegetables, seeds and grains and other items that people shouldn't have and that they have failed to declare. There is a very high chance that you will be caught. I'm glad there's a high chance that people will be caught, because I don't want our farmers and our agricultural industries put at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ideally, this bill would not be necessary. The increase in infringement notices and fines would not be necessary if people were doing the right thing and didn't bring in prohibited goods. Please educate yourself. If you have visitors from overseas coming to see you, when our borders have reopened, please make sure that they understand what you can and can't bring in. Visit the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment's website. Familiarise yourself with the incoming passenger card and, if in doubt, please make a declaration. Check with our wonderful biosecurity staff that the items you have are safe to bring in. The staff work so hard to keep our nation safe and to protect all our farmers and fisheries from exotic pests and diseases that would have catastrophic impacts if they were to come into Australia. We are lucky, in many ways, to be a large and relatively isolated island. It has meant we are one of the cleanest, greenest, safest and most productive agricultural nations in the world. Let's keep it that way. Let's all do the right thing, in terms of biosecurity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I notice in this debate that a coalition MP posed the question: 'Why are we even debating this legislation?' The reason we are is that the legislation itself is crucial. It's not just about protecting livestock or agriculture. Biosecurity matters. It saves lives. It protects Australians. It has a very important place, in the broad range of things, particularly during a pandemic where we should be ensuring that the biosecurity of all Australians is protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This governmentâ€”particularly this minister, who is here in the chamberâ€”should hang their heads in absolute shame for the grossest dereliction of duty we have seen through the course of this pandemic. This minister, who is responsible for this bill, demonstrated the astounding incompetence of being unable to know what aspects of his own legislation covered the protection of Australians and their health. This minister now is saying that he wants to bring in a whole range of measures that make ordinary Australians feel like crims, but when he does the wrong thing he's not held accountable for it. It is embarrassing that a minister of the Crown is so spectacularly incapable of knowing what his own act is responsible for and still holds his job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it absolutely clear that none of the critical remarks I make in the course of this debate are directed at those public servants who do the public a great service at our airports and ports, and who do the right thing to help protect Australians. My criticisms are not directed at them; in fact, my greatest compliments are directed at them for their public service. The greatest criticism should go to their bosses. The greatest criticism should go to the ministers who failed the Australian public. Under the regime that's been put in place here, every Australian tries to do the right thing when they come back from an overseas trip. The pen hovers over the card, and people try to work out which box they should tick to do the right thing. They are made to feel that pressure. There are TV crews in Australian airports that monitor them, making ordinary, average Australians feel like they're doing something wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it came to the big issues of protecting the country during the pandemic, we found the department of agriculture and this minister wantingâ€”this minister in particular, along with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs. When biosecurity mattered in a pandemic, they were found wanting. In particular, everyone in the country knows about the 2,700 people who were affected by coronavirus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, the 700 people who were infected by coronavirus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> and the 20-plus Australians who lost their lives because they contracted coronavirus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. They lost their lives. They paid the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get worked up about this issue when I think of all those passengers who went on that trip. They were just ordinary, average Australians. Many of them were older Australians who went the hard slog in their jobs, paid off their mortgages and raised their kids. They have grandchildren. They took a cruise, like a lot of Australians do. They treated themselves. They went on those cruises thinking they would have a great time. When they boarded and when they went to get off the cruise, they depended on the government to do the right thing and look after them. They depended on the cruise operators to do the right thing and look after them. They were massively let down through the course of this incident, and the lapses in biosecurity were critical in impacting on the health of ordinary Australians. Those ordinary Australians who took that cruise should have had full confidence that their health and safety would be protected and that, when they got off their cruise, they would not be attending a funeral. I genuinely feel for those people. I genuinely feel that we let them down and I genuinely feel that at no point did this government ever step up. The government that is quick to point fingers at others never stepped up to take responsibility for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May we heard that, on the evening before passengers were allowed to disembark, federal authorities were aware of 128 sick people aboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, including 24 with a temperature. That's what the Senate COVID committee was told. The Australian Border Forceâ€”which said, as a result of the Prime Minister's declaration in mid-March, that they would control which cruise boats came in or didn't come inâ€”didn't tell the harbourmaster what he should or shouldn't do, and Australian Border Force claimed they had no legislated authority to do that in regard to a biosecurity threat. The minister laughed a few minutes earlier about whether or not he was accountable. When quizzed on <span style="font-style:italic;">RN Breakfast</span> on 14 August about an act he was responsible for, this ministerâ€”agriculture minister David Littleproudâ€”who is responsible for this legislation and these protections, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well let me make clear, that federal agricultural agency only looks after plants and animals; they don't look after human health.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an act that this minister administers, and he doesn't even know he is responsible for human health. It's not that he didn't know; it's that he didn't want to admit that this was what he was responsible for, because there have been lapses between various government ministers in accounting for biosecurity threats with what happened with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often put that there were no federal representatives on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> when it went to dock. They claim in many instances that it was NSW Health. But that is just wrong. There absolutely were representatives of Agriculture or the federal government on that ship. On top of that, the minister responsible for this act has repeatedly failed to explain the exact times that officials from his own department gave approval for people to disembark the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> and, therefore, spread coronavirus in this country. It reached as far as Tasmania and triggered the lockdown of that state. That is a result of lapses that can be attributed to the minister responsible for the Biosecurity Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister was quizzed on TV about when they gave approval, he said: 'They gave it on 19 March. The exact time I don't have in front of me.' It is one of the most seismic events in the course of the pandemic and he didn't have the detail. It's just like the aged-care minister, who didn't know the number of people who lost their lives in aged-care facilities in this country. We had another minister who didn't know crucial details involving the disembarkation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again the minister responsible for this act has refused to acknowledge or apologise. His departmental secretary conceded to the committee that the department itself failed to do the required traveller-with-illness checklist onboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>. Ordinary Australians are forced to look very carefully at the things they're filling out when they come backâ€”the things that are being debated in this legislationâ€”but the minister's own department don't do the same thing when it's up to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened at the start of the pandemic when the Queensland Premier wrote to the Prime Minister about the traveller identification cards that had been handed upâ€”the very cards that we're debating in this legislation? They said that they wanted to keep more data on travellers for contact tracing. As we have all become very aware, contact tracing plays a crucial role in containing the spread of coronavirus. The Queensland Premier wrote to the Prime Minister and asked to get these cards. Samantha Maiden from news.com.au wrote in September:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the states dealt with the influx of international passengers, they were shocked to learn that incoming travellers' passenger cards were essentially thrown in the bin or unable to be accessed on privacy grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the same cards that we've been told today play such an important role in biosecurity. Yet, when the states asked for access to them to enable more efficient contact tracing to limit the spread of coronavirus, this government failed to do the job. We're being asked to improve the penalty regime in this legislation, but this minister can't even do his job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinary Australiansâ€”just like those passengers on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>â€”expect that governments will be there to protect them, but they're not. At no point has the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs or that minister over there stepped up and accepted responsibility. Why? Because they've spent too much time playing political games and trying to blame the states. They've been involved in blaming states for what's not happening in the shutdownâ€”blaming them for this recession, in effect. We had this spread of coronavirus that triggered a whole set of shutdowns and lockdowns and all this economic spend, and yet we get asked, as the Labor Party, why do we call it the 'Morrison recession'? The reason is choices were madeâ€”or not madeâ€”that had an impact on people's livelihoods and had an impact on the economy. The government should be held to account for the depth of this recession. They should be held to account for the amount of money that they've had to pay in the budget to help save the economy because of a biosecurity threat that they triggered when they failed to do the right thing on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard the member for Higgins blame the Victorian government for this and that, despite the fact the federal government didn't do the right thing on aged care, despite the fact the federal government were quite happy for self-isolation rather than quarantining. The states had to step up to do quarantining because the feds wouldn't do it. And on top of that we had the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, a biosecurity threat that was not managed properly by this government. Every single one of them should hang their heads in shame for those ordinary Australians that copped it because of them. Instead of accepting responsibility, all they did was shift it somewhere else. It's just wrong! For example, the Minister for Home Affairs said: 'I don't employ a doctor or nurse at airports and ports to help with biosecurity. That's the responsibility of the Victorian health department, the Queensland health department, the New South Wales health department. It's nothing to do with Australian Border Force. They look at the documentation. They want to make sure people have valid passports and people have valid visas, that they are not criminals coming into this country. They do not conduct testing and they do not conduct temperature tests et cetera. That is not their responsibility.' It's just not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of the federal government to be accountable is letting Australians down. This government's failure and dereliction of duty is hurting Australians, it has caused the death of Australians, and that's why this government doesn't accept responsibility. When it comes to the realisation it has done the wrong thing, it doesn't want to accept responsibility. All it wants to do is shift it, and this bill is another example of that. This minister is another example of the incompetence that led to the deaths of Australians, and this government should absolutely hang its head in shame for the way it let down ordinary Australians in this country.</span>

The bill will allow the biosecurity regulation to specify different penalty amounts and different periods of time to pay for infringement notices issued for different kinds of alleged contraventions of the Biosecurity Act, including by reference to the kinds of goods or classes of goods to which an alleged contravention relates, and permit the director of biosecurity to make a non-disallowable legislative instrument to specify goods or classes of goods that can attract a higher infringement notice amount. These changes will enable incoming passengers or crew who fail to declare high-risk biosecurity goods listed in the legislative instrument to be issued with an infringement notice in the amount of 12 penalty units, or $2,664 after penalty units are increased on 1 July. This is an increase from the current infringement notice amount of two penalty units or $444 that applies regardless of the relative risk of the goods to which the contravention relates.</span>

This is a sensible and timely improvement to Australia's biosecurity system that is consistent with mature, regulatory practice. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment is moved on behalf of the member for Maribyrnong, who is unable to attend this sitting of parliament. In moving this amendment, I stand with the member for Maribyrnong in stating that it is impossible to overstate the seriousness of this issue and that the government must put in place the safeguards needed to protect Australians who are accessing the NDIS, and I stress how serious the situation is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has its origin in the tragic death of Adelaide woman Ann-Marie Smith. It is a partial response to the shortcomings in the system that led to Ann-Marie's death. And when I say 'partial response', the emphasis should be on 'partial'. There is nothing inappropriate about the changes proposed, but they are largely peripheral to the reform and the bolder action that needs to be taken to prevent further, similar lonely deaths of Australians with disabilities. To properly illustrate just how peripheral these changes are, I need to discuss the sad details of Ann-Marie's passing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie Smith had cerebral palsy. She lived alone and she relied on a carer for all her needs. She was an NDIS participant and her package entitled her to six hours of support a day. She was 54 years old when she died on 6 April. Some details of her death and last days and weeks remain unclear. But this is what we do know. She had been confined to a cane chair for 24 hours a day for more than a year. The chair had become her toilet. It is unimaginable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 April, Ann-Marie's carer attended her home and, finding her unresponsive, called for an ambulance. At the Royal Adelaide Hospital, she had major surgery to remove the rotting flesh and severe pressure sores she had on her body. She went into palliative care and died the next day. The pain must have been unimaginable. Ann-Marie died of severe septic shock, multi-organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected to her cerebral palsy. The police referred to her death as having occurred in disgusting and degrading circumstances. Only upon admission to hospital and a complaint made by the attending doctors to the health authorities were any alarms triggered about the NDIS participant's care or lack of it. Unfortunately for Ann-Marie, it was too late. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a characteristic lack of transparency about the authorities' actions in this case from the NDIS minister, Stuart Robert. We should safely assume that, on the day of Ann-Marie's death, when the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner was notified, Mr Robert was also notified. Despite this, the case was not made public until the police probe triggered media reports more than a month later, in mid-May. It took a week after that for the NDIS watchdog, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, to sanction the company, the NDIS provider, that was being paid for Ann-Marie's care. The penalty: a measly $12,600 fine. It's insulting, it's disrespectful and it's pathetic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian government launched a state inquiry, but the minister refused to launch a national equivalent, despite another death by neglect in a house in New South Wales of another NDIS participant. I tend to think the quality and safeguards commission, the so-called watchdog, would have been happy to leave it at that. But, under pressure to do something, Minister Robert said the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission would look into Ann-Marie's case. This amounted to Stuart Robert suggesting the watchdog look into her case, where the watchdog's own neglect and inaction played a starring role. If the watchdog had done its job, this provider and carer would not have been able to neglect Ann-Marie to her death. She would have experienced a living hellâ€”an absolute living hell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 May, Labor and the member for Maribyrnong publicly pointed out the unworkable conflict of Mr Robert's solution and demanded an independent inquiry. The next day the watchdog announced that an independent former judge would be reviewing what happened, not the watchdog. This was some progress. It is not the national inquiry we need, though, and it is no comfort to the loved ones of another NDIS participant, David Harris, who was found in his Parramatta apartment after he passed away after being unilaterally kicked out of the NDIS. Mr Harris died in his home after his NDIS supports were cut off because he missed a review meeting, and he was not found for months after his death. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the immediate aftermath of Ann-Marie's death, the provider was happy for all the blame to be hung on the carer who worked for them. Initially Stuart Robert's disability watchdog, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, was also happy for the provider to be given a small fine and to leave it at that. Sadly, the real disability watchdog work in this case has been left to the South Australian Police, and they only got called in after the tragedy had already occurred. Following the public scandal, the outcry, and the strong work of the police, the disability watchdog had a longer think about it, and eventually deregistered the provider. And now we have this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill allows for the banning of a carer from further NDIS work in a situation where the carer is no longer employed by the NDIS provider. It is a worthy change, but it would not have prevented Ann-Marie's carer from neglecting her because, at that point, she was an employee. I note that the carer currently has bigger things to worry about. She's in home detention, awaiting trial, charged with manslaughter. That is because, as noted in this case, the conscientious authority has been the South Australian Police.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's taken six months for this government to bring forward these minor legislative changes to a second reading. In that time, the South Australian Police have investigated, got a brief of evidence together and charged the carer. How sad that the ultimate authority looking out for people with disability is not the disability watchdog; it is the policeâ€”it takes a crime for anyone to take notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other proposed change in this bill would allow the pre-emptive banning of a person from disability work due to their actions in an adjacent, non-disability area. This would have caught out Ann-Marie's carer, because she had previously been banned from Domiciliary Care, South Australia, due to accusations of theft. This change would, of course, have prevented Ann-Marie's specific carer from neglecting her, but it would not prevent another carer from doing the same and being tolerated or encouraged to do so by a substantive provider not held accountable by the watchdog.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A cynic might suggest it's the NDIS minister's attempt to appear to be a man of action and to appear to be doing something so that Ms Smith and others may not have seemed to have died in vain. Even now, this bill does not even amount to shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. These changes alone will not prevent future abuse, neglect, pain and possible death. These changes just make things a little better. These changes are painting the gate after the horse has bolted. These legislative changes presuppose that the determinative cause of Ms Smith's death was that a good watchdog had its hands tied, and these changes will untie them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad truth, though, is that we have a disability watchdog that is not performing its role and a seven-year-old government turning a blind eye. The second the circumstances of Ms Smith's demise came to light, the NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, should have come down on the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission like a thunderbolt. In short, the minister should be making his commission do its job. Instead, through exercises like this one, the minister is doing the opposite of that. He is actually providing cover to the watchdog, which has been found sleeping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why won't the minister demand the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission get out there to keep providers and workers accountable? Who knows. Perhaps he thinks it will be expensive. Perhaps he plans to turn the whole thing into an app, as the digital innovator that he thinks he is. Or perhaps he doesn't care about the disability portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to another sad truth: when it comes to portfolios involving vulnerable Australians such as aged care and disability, the Australian people get the dregs of Morrison's ministry. Why do we have to wait for tragedies for these portfolios to be treated seriously and for them to be elevated to people who can do the job?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a reaction to Ms Smith's death, this bill is, frankly, underwhelmingly disrespectful. At the risk of mixing animal metaphors, the elephant in the room here is this government's watchdog and its failure to perform its role. All institutions can tend towards entropy. The fault lies at the minister's feet, firstly, for allowing this to happen and, secondly, after the alarm had been sounded by these deaths, in failing to demand anything be done differently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This watchdog has powers and resources to do its job well. No doubt there are many hardworking, well-intentioned people there. By their own account, the watchdog, the NDIS commission, already has broad powers. A media release of the commission dated 21 May states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Commission has broad powers to take compliance and enforcement action when NDIS providers are found not to have met their obligations under the NDIS Act 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this watchdog has only ever issued one fine to a providerâ€”the one given to Integrity Care over Ann-Marie's deathâ€”despite more than 8,000 complaints in the last two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers routinely fail to report disability deaths to the watchdog in a timely manner, and there is seemingly little consequence. This government funds the executive of the watchdog to jet around, but does not ask them to do unannounced spot checks on the industry to keep everyone safe. Their own independent review of Ms Smith's death, conducted by Alan Robertson SC, made a series of sensible recommendations, including proactive spot checks, community visitation and that more than one carer be responsible for a vulnerable person with a disability. This was the review initiated under the watch of Stuart Roberts, yet there has been nothing but deathly silence from the minister as to whether the government accepts them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I say that death by neglect of NDIS participants in their homes reveals a real need for the government to provide an NDIS watchdog that is willing to use its teeth. An overwhelming majority of carers and providers do the right thing. They do a great job in trying circumstances. All we ask of the watchdog is that it keep an eye on the sector and weed out the bad ones who do not do the right thing, and that it to do that before they do a great amount of harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will support this legislation, though it would likely have made little difference in the deaths of Ms Smith and Mr Harris. A common link in all these cases is a lack of an active watchdog supervising the NDIS and performing active quality control, including unannounced spot checks on providers and the carers working for them. Under the hapless reign of Minister Stuart Robert and after seven years of Liberal mismanagement of the NDIS, the commission is acting more like a purse puppy than a watchdog. The commission has still not launched an inquiry into the death of Mr Harris. It is an outrage. Putting the watchdog to work is the real action required by this government to prevent further disability tragedies. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  Nothing is more important to our nation than supporting our community's most vulnerable and helping them achieve the highest standard of living possible. This bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020, strengthens the integrity of the NDIS system by providing additional powers to the commissioner to ban providers who, due to misconduct, are unsuitable for this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We require the highest standards when it comes to organisations and people involved in delivering the NDIS. Why others in this House do not support us on that is really a question for them. There is no room for shortcuts. There is no place for second best. It is important that the system and the people tasked with looking after the interests of vulnerable people are given the resources to do their job. To us as a government the safety and wellbeing of Australians is paramount. Expanding the powers of the commissioner to ban those who are unsuitable could not be more important. How are we to empower Australians if we cannot guarantee their wellbeing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the legislation currently stands, the commissioner does not haveâ€”let me repeat that: does not haveâ€”the authority to ban non-NDIS providers from entering the scheme. This means, for example, that an organisation guilty of misconduct can close its NDIS arm of the business to avoid sanctions. Gaming the system is simply not on, especially when it comes to the disabled, the elderly or children. As a government and, I would say, as a nation we have a special responsibility to the less fortunateâ€”a duty of care and a responsibility that will be enshrined by this bill being passed by this House. Having worked in aged care I understand the importance of putting in the right kinds of protections to help those who help others. This legislation will make a big difference by proactively stopping unscrupulous actors from undermining our system and putting other people's lives at risk. Taking a strong stand on this issue could not be more important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the current provisions are too narrow, this legislation in effect closes a potential loophole and undermines vested interests which are seeking to exploit the system as it stands. Pre-emptively banning someone from providing services to the NDIS may feel harsh, and, indeed, in most circumstances it isâ€”but not in these circumstances. The reality is that, if somebody has been identified as unsuitable, due to their past actions, to work with persons in fields such as aged care or child care, they should not be allowed to do so under the NDIS. Far from picking people out for exclusion, this bill is about keeping consistency and justice at the core of our system, and is designed to protect people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All too frequently, bureaucracy gets in the way of people; it disempowers them. We see it with startups looking to innovate, we see it with small businesses try to pay tax and now we are seeing it with the most vulnerable members of our society. It is tragic that, at a time when Australians are doing it tough, there are still vested interests that are calling for more regulation and higher taxes, all the while ignoring the fact that this puts Australians' lives at real risk. This bill takes a stand against the exclusive clubs that game the systems that Australians rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our smarter regulation agenda is not about more or less regulation but about better regulation, fairer regulation, simpler regulation; regulation that makes people's lives better, not worse; regulation that empowers individuals to make decisions so they can make their lives better. It is not about higher taxes but about simpler taxes, fairer taxes, that help small businesses run by mums and dads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Smarter regulation is empowering those with disabilities to pursue their own goals and to live a fulfilling life. Smarter regulation is providing that base level of protection and assurance. This has been the foundation of Australia's prosperity, which has been slowly chipped away with the passing of new and more regulation and higher and higher taxes. As we look towards our post-COVID-19 recovery plan we will be relying more than ever on streamlined regulation where no-one is left behind. This especially includes those with a disability, the elderly and children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposed measure will expand the NDIS commissioner's powers to allow a banning order to be made in relation to a person who was but is no longer employed by an NDIS provider. The current legislation requires individuals to be employed at the time for the banning order to apply. This means that those who are guilty of gross misconduct could be working in a similar or, indeed, the same field, as long as it is not with the NDIS or an NDIS provider. This may very well be putting Australians in danger. It is something that we need to stop and stop now. This is a time for decisive action in defence of the vulnerable and those who may not have a strong voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS provider register includes a list of those who are banned. Ensuring that that list is comprehensive is an important part of the first line of defence for NDIS participants and their representatives to ensure that any provider or worker they might engage is not currently subject to a banning order. This means having a commissioner who is empowered to protect those benefiting from the NDIS. An important part of that process is being able to issue a banning order to organisations who either are employed by the NDIS or have left the sector. Currently, if an employee leaves the sector due to an issue which may result in a banning consideration, they may be able to avoid that ban. This bill strengthens the system that we rely on to help protect our loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS provider register holds information about the identity of providers and workers who had a banning order made against them by the NDIS commissioner, and includes enough information to identify them. The register is publicly available to allow persons with a disability and their representatives and providers to ensure the people they are engaging to deliver NDIS services are not subject to banning orders. This database is an important part of maintaining the integrity of NDIS and protecting people. Australians should have complete certainty that the professionals who are entrusted with their care are correctly trained, have a good track record of delivering their services and are not a risk. This bill gives the commissioner additional powers such that he can support positive outcomes for those in our nation who most need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has meant we are all focused on the safety and security of those who are most susceptible to the pandemic. Often this has significant overlap with those who are disabled and currently using the NDIS. All it takes is a single person's misconduct for COVID-19 to cause mass disruption and harm. Whilst this bill is not specifically related to the pandemic, the reality is that, by being able to pre-emptively ban people who have a history of misconduct, we are giving ourselves security against the careless mistakes that cost lives. This is more crucial now than at any other time in living memory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing additional measures of support and care is time sensitive. That is why, even with the disruption that the pandemic has caused, we are prioritising this bill. It is a reflection of this government's ongoing commitment to retirees, to children, to the vulnerable and, frankly, to all Australians. That is part of what it means to have a fair go. Hardworking Australians deserve systems which protect their loved ones and provide the best possible care. This is an integral part of building healthy and strong communities. With bushfires, floods and now a global pandemic, we are relying on our neighbours and communities more than ever. The government has a critical role to play in ensuring that everyone in our community is being protected and helped and that those in need are being cared for. Building resilient communities depends on building systems that are robust and put Australians first. This bill safeguards vulnerable people by empowering the commissioner to act pre-emptively against those who are unsuitable for looking after vulnerable people, due to prior misconduct. This bolsters the effectiveness of the NDIS provider register, which in turn helps inform effective decision-making on the part of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is creating a better Australia, based on the principles of a fair go, justice and protecting those who are more susceptible to misconduct. Legislation of this kind has a negligible financial impact and it helps to create a better NDIS and a better Australia. There are many who seek a larger and more interventionist government because, in their view, government can solve all problems. The reality is that government is no replacement for robust communities or for families, especially in times of crisis. Rather than trying to prescribe what each individual requires, this government has always been about supporting the individual aspirations of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vision of the NDIS is to do exactly that. We do not seek to have a one-size-fits-all approach, especially given the complications that disabilities can result in. It is the individuals and their carers and representatives who know best, not a bureaucrat in Canberra with a big-government agenda. We are returning the power of choice to the Australian peopleâ€”the power to decide what a good life means for the individual and how best to go about achieving it. We are trusting in our fellow countrymen. For this to become a reality, the role of government is simple: create and maintain effective systems that put hardworking Australians first. We can wax lyrical in this place about compassion and care. It is easy to say; it is harder to do. This bill does that. For these reasons, I highly commend it to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  [by video link] I am speaking today on this bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020, because we need to do so much better for people with disability, their families and carers. The NDIS is a great Labor reform. Unfortunately, its implementation has been bungled by this government's neglect and lack of interest. We have seen that reflected in the number of cases of neglect and abuse of people with disability. This just shouldn't be the case. The reports of the death of Ann-Marie Smith shocked our country. While this bill is a first step in creating a stronger framework to ban providers, we need further provisions to stop the abuse of people with disability before it happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also go further and address the systemic failures this government has allowed to develop within the NDIS. We should not be leaving people with disability vulnerable to providers or carers who do not meet the highest of standards. We should not be leaving people with disability vulnerable to pandemics, like the current COVID pandemic. We can and we must do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to broaden the circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission may make a banning order against a provider or a person. The bill also seeks to clarify the commissioner's powers. These are welcome changes and they do address areas where the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's powers are too narrow. But these changes do not do enough and I support the amendments moved by the member for Barton in the name of the member for Maribyrnong. Of course we need a commission that is empowered to act if abuse is found to exist. But we also need a system that means abuse is stopped before it occurs. We need a system where oversight of the care of vulnerable people is baked in from the beginning. We've just seen in our aged-care system during this pandemic how it plays out when a regulator does not see itself as having a preventative role, and I am concerned that the NDIS commissioner remains in a similar space. Every person with disability deserves to feel confident that the care and support they are receiving is of high quality and will keep them safe. I am very concerned that the changes in this bill do not go far enough to ensure that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has monitoring powers, under the regulatory powers act, to enter premises voluntarily to ensure the act is being appropriately administered, and, if it is refused entry, a monitoring warrant can be applied for. However, the number of times these powers have been used has not been reported, and this again goes to how the commission sees its role. It's clear the commission is not exercising the full extent of its proactive monitoring powers or its powers to penalise non-compliant providers. Under the Morrison government's watch, the commission has received more than 8,000 complaints about the abuse, neglect and even fatalities of Australians with disability. Yet, from all of these complaints, the commissioner has issued just one fine and banned only one provider and 22 individuals. That is despite thousands of complaints and thousands of tip-offs. Something is clearly amiss here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already heard about the harrowing case of Ann-Marie Smith. This just should not have occurred. Adelaide NDIS participant, 54-year-old Ann-Marie Smith died on 6 April of severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnutrition. Her NDIS package included six hours of support per day. It has since been reported that she only received two hours of care and was confined to a cane chair, 24 hours a day, for more than a year. Her death launched a South Australian police investigation into the carer, and the SA government created a safeguarding task force to examine the current gaps in oversight and safeguarding for people with disability. Finally, this government was pressured to commission an independent review of the NDIS commission's regulation of the provider of NDIS supports and services to Ann-Marie Smith, which was established and conducted by the Hon. Alan Robertson SC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say the government was 'pressured', because the review was established following public pressure and calls from Labor for an independent investigation. My Labor colleagues and I have continually argued that this should have been a broader inquiry. As we heard from the member for Barton, it should have also looked at what went wrong in the case of David Harris, an NDIS participate who was found dead in his house more than two months after his supports had been cut off. The inquiry should have been free to look at broader considerations such as whether the commission has in fact been a toothless watchdog across multiple cases, not just that of this provider, and whether the $4.6 billion funding cuts this government has made to the scheme mean that we're having more deaths in homes by neglect, because the money for regulation is just not there. The investigator should have had subpoena powers, and disability advocates should have been much better supported to engage with the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these flaws, it's clear from the inquiry's recommendations that the NDIS commission has not been set up properly and that the NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, has failed to fix this, despite these tragic cases of NDIS abuse, neglect and death. The inquiry does not identify any failings in how the quality and safeguards commission carried out its functions around Ann-Marie Smith's death, but this is because the real reason the commission didn't fail is that the commission's scope is too narrow. It is not taking on a preventative role. It is only empowered to act once abuse has happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With its 10 broad-ranging recommendations, the inquiry report clearly shows that the commission and the NDIS safeguarding framework are not set up to effectively protect people who use the NDIS. The report highlights buck-passing between the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The problem is that the NDIS commission only regulates providers and the NDIA is set up to administer the scheme to participants. The report rightly highlights that the two agencies are not sharing information and that people are falling through the cracks of this patchy oversight. The government must respond as soon as possible to this inquiry report and implement its findings. We don't have time to waste. Ann-Marie Smith died on 6 April 2020 after years of neglect. It is now 7 October 2020, nine months later, and we still do not have the steps we need to make sure that this will never happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referenced earlier how part of what we're seeing at the moment has the potential to reflect what we've seen in aged care during the pandemicâ€”where the regulator doesn't see itself as having a preventive role in supporting vulnerable people but rather comes in afterwards to try to fix up a mess that is already created. We know that this government was caught off guard by COVID and we know the damage that COVID has had on our aged-care facilities because of this. We know that the Morrison government had no COVID plan for our aged-care facilities. Likewise, the disability sector is still without a comprehensive government plan or support to deal with the pandemic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't see the COVID contagion rates, locations and deaths for people with disability. The system of reporting is just not there. Again this goes to oversight and regulation. It goes to safety and quality. It goes to people with disability and their families and carers being able to be confident that the people that they let into their homes and the people they rely on for care are people who can be trusted and will provide them with the highest standard. That is not an assurance they can have at the moment. Unfortunately, it's not an assurance that this bill gives them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from disability providers in my own electorate about these issues through the pandemic. They themselves are worried about the lack of planning and support that has gone into this from this federal government. Providers have told me that they don't feel supported through this pandemic. They were expected to, on their own, close or readjust their services to try to meet demand in a safe way. These adjustments were unfunded by the government. They didn't get extra support for COVID plans and communication systems they needed. Not all participants were able to adjust to new systems and new ways of working, meaning that some participants have been left unsupported and providers have been left without income. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The loading that was available to service providers through the NDIA ceased on 30 June 2020, despite here in Victoria still experiencing a very severe COVID outbreak. Providers are having to meet the immense cost of PPE, having to support their workers and trying to do the best by people with disability all without the support they should get from the federal government and all without a system that has the right level of quality, safety and oversight that vulnerable people with disability deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a cliche for us to say that as a society we should be judged on how we protect vulnerable people. People with disability deserve choice and control. They deserve a NDIS that works for them. They also deserve to know that the care they get is of the highest standard. As I've said before, that is not what this bill delivers. It is not what we have seen happening under the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. It is very concerningâ€”and remains very concerning for people with disability, their families and their carers and it remains concerning for the providers who want to do the best by their clients and by the people they supportâ€”that these frameworks are not in place as they should be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're concerned that this government has dropped the ball. They're concerned that there hasn't been action taken since these tragic deaths that I've highlighted to change the way that the system is regulated to the extent that it will mean that we are taking preventive action and not waiting for tragedies to occur, and that people with disability and their families and carers are assured that the system is set up to do the job it shouldâ€”to keep them safe and to make sure they get the highest possible standard of care. We should not have a system where people have to die for an investigation to take place. We should not have a system where neglect has to occur before someone is found to be unfit to be working in it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for this government to take more action. It's time for it to take this issue more seriously. This bill starts the process. It does not finish it. I urge the government to make sure that it goes a lot further than what we have seen to date.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  [by video link] I appreciate the call to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. Since the NDIS rollout began in July 2014 until the end of June this year, some 391,999 people have become participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. When this scheme is fully rolled out right across Australia, some 432,000 Australians will be participants in the scheme. This comes at a very considerable cost of $23.4 million in funding in the full year of rollout of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission was established on 1 July 2018, and its essential functions are to ensure compliance with the act and to promote quality services and safeguards. Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2020, the commission received some 5,784 in-scope complaints, which it has dealt with. As part of that process, the commission has banned some 23 entities, 22 of which are individuals. Fifteen of those bans were based on the suitability of the person concerned. The NDIS strengthening banning orders provisions are to provide further powers to the commission. They broaden the circumstances in which the commission may ban a worker or a provider from delivering services, even if that worker or provider is no longer operating in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The commission may also take pre-emptive action against an individual or an organisation and, of course, it can make publicly available its decision and its resolution to ban a particular person. These are sensible additional amendments to the legislation to give the commission the power that it needs to ensure the safeguards of individuals in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme of this parliament, I wish to mention a couple of inquiries in the context of the NDIS that the committee is currently undertaking. One is into planning, which we hope to be able to finally report on soon. Another one is on general issues, on which we expect to issue a progress report by the end of this year. Importantly, we have two other inquiries underway, one into the work of the quality and safeguards commission and one into the role and the future workforce for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. These inquiries go very much to matters covered in this bill and also the broader NDIS itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two issues are important for the future success of the scheme. One is obviously having an adequate workforce in terms of the number of people who can provide services. Another issue is skills and training, and the competency of that workforce. It's expected that we'll see a trebling of the number of workers in disability services over the coming few years, and that's at the same time that we'll need a trebling of the number of workers in aged care. So there's going to be significant demand and competition, if you like, to have an adequate workforce to provide these services. Without an adequate workforce, the services can't be provided and the scheme cannot live up to the expectations that so many Australians have for it. Equally, the quality and the training of the workforce is important, which is where quality assurance comes into play. How do we encourage service providers to prioritise quality and ensure that that quality is risk averse in terms of what's provided to the participants in the scheme? A simple tick-a-box approach is not as good as a genuine commitment to actually providing quality of services in this scheme. I sometimes wonder whether the approach that we've taken on both sides of parliament under the political hues of both the Liberal-National coalition and the Labor Party in aged care, for example, which has relied largely on a tick-a-box approach, has perhaps precluded the development of quality assurance by the providers themselves at a level that we should be able to expect from a scheme such as aged care and, now and in the future, in relation to disability services. In relation to the commission's function, developing a nationally consistent approach to managing quality and safeguards for people who have a disability and who are receiving supports or services is one of the core functions of the quality commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary joint standing committee will continue to look at these issues over the coming weeks and months, particularly in relation to the quality and safeguards commission and also the workforce itself. In the meantime, this is an important piece of legislation and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I'm pleased to rise today in the House to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. As we've heard from speakers today, the NDIS was introduced by the former Gillard government in response to the Productivity Commission recommendations, and it provides support to some of the marginalised people in our community: people with a disability, their families and their carers. It gives independence and social and economic participation to people with disability. It gives reasonable and necessary support, including early intervention. It gives people with disability a choice and control over the pursuit of their goals and planning for the delivery of their support and hopefully a nationally consistent approach. As members of parliament, we've all seen the power of the NDIS. But I think all members of parliament have also seen the difficulties in navigating and understanding the complexities and also the deficiencies of the NDIS. The bill being debated today seeks to expand the circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner may make a banning order against a provider or person and clarifies the commissioner's powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a little time today speaking about some local cases to bring to the parliament's attention some of the examples I have come across from the community I represent. I also want to focus, in my remarks today, on a pretty important second reading amendment moved by the member for Barton. I'm very glad the member for Barton has moved this amendment, because it enables me to highlight some of the issues that I certainly come across. In the first part of the amendment we've got: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">... take responsibility for all 'deaths by neglect' within the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is a Federal Government program;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we've got:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... immediately respond to the report to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner by Alan Robertson SC into the adequacy of the regulation of the supports and services provided to Ms Ann-Marie Smith, who died on 6 April 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are appropriate. However, they do not address the failure of the NDIS and the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework to prevent abuse. I'm glad Minister Robert is at the table today, because I want him to hear firsthand some of the examples from my community, where people have suffered and had a terrible experience with the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first things I did following the election in May 2019, within a matter of weeks of that election, was hold an NDIS roundtable. It was held in Goodna in my electorate, where I brought together a whole range of stakeholders, including service organisations and service providers, a number of churches that are involved with the disability sector, advocates, parents and carers. I wanted that to be the first thing I did on my re-election to this place, because the community, during the most recent federal election, made it clear to me that there were problems with the scheme, and they wanted them fixed, and I wanted to hit the ground running post that election. The shadow minister, Bill Shorten, attended that forum and heard firsthand. One of the outcomes from that roundtable was for me to write directly to the minister who's at the table now with the concerns. I requested a meeting with him and his office about those concerns, and that's what the community wanted me to raise. To this date, I've had no response to that correspondence. </span>

That's fair enough. But don't you dareâ€”through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vastaâ€”dismiss the concerns. Don't wave them away like you're doing. Don't wave them away like they're an annoyance. Don't wave them away like they're some kind of irritant. They're not. These are people with real stories and real life experience. I'm going to talk that about experience today, as a result of the member for Barton's second reading amendment, so that the minister hears. It might be uncomfortable for him to hear truths, but it is time he started listening, not simply dismissing people. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk in the chamber today about a local resident who has had a horrific experience. Her name is Annie. I met with her. She is the mum of two sons who suffer from a form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Annie has been in touch with my electorate office since August 2018. There's been funding taken away from her plan in the past. She's had difficulty getting these reviews. She's had trouble and delays getting wheelchairs, ramps and modifications in the house to assist her sons. These are adult children who have severe and complex issues. They like to leave the house on their own for some independence. It is impossible for them to do that. It's been a struggle against all struggles for Annie. I've met with her and I've seen the tears in her eyes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She is an amazing mum. She's on her own, but she's an amazing mum. She doesn't complain. She doesn't complain about herself. She doesn't complain about all the things she has to go without. She just wants her kids, her boys, while they're still with her, to have the quality of life that any other child would. It breaks her heart that she can't do that for her kids. I think that's the hardest thing when you meet with a parentâ€”that all they want is to be able to do things for their kids so that their kids feel like they're valued. I promised Anne that I would raise this in the parliament today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She's had trouble with delays in getting wheelchairs and home modifications. The latest issue is getting around legislation that has no NDIA funding for in-hospital patients. This is something people forget about. When a severely disabled person with complex health issues enters hospital for treatment, there are no support packages for them once they're in the hospital. As the mum of two sons who need constantly care, she can't leave one son at home and the other son in hospital without care. She feels completely conflicted about leaving at home one son she needs to look after, but there's no care for the one in hospital. I know that sounds silly in a hospital, but the complex needs are so varied that she needs that extra support while they're in hospital. You would think, 'Well, there are nurses and doctors there,' but they're not qualified and they simply don't have the resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to bring to the parliament's attention today the real deficiency for a whole range of people who are struggling. It may be a negotiation between the Commonwealth and state health systems. I understand that. But this is a real issue for thousands of people. They need to stay at home for care responsibilities but they also need to be at the hospital when people are dealing with complex health issues. There's no funding or avenues for that extra support. This is a policy area. It's not specific to the bill, but I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about this, given the member for Barton's second reading amendment today, so that we can understand the complex health and safety issues for a whole cohort of people who are really struggling at the moment. As Annie said to our officeâ€”she is just one of manyâ€”she doesn't want any special treatment. She just wants to be able to know that when her sons are admitted to hospital on alternative bases that there is proper care for them and extra support services there, so they're not a burden to the existing nurses and allied health services, and she's also got the quality of care of looking after her sons at home.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly speak on the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. Shortly after his appointment in 2018, the inaugural NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner, Graham Head, gave a speech to CEDA in which he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're able to take a range of actions including deregistration, banning orders or seeking the application of civil penalties so we really do have a comprehensive tool kit. We have comprehensive regulatory powers and functions, and real regulatory teeth. Incidents that must be reported to the commission include the death of a participant, serious injury, abuse or neglect and importantly also the unauthorised use of a restrictive practice in relation to a participant. It does represent a significant step change in how we approach the delivery of quality services to people with disability and how we protect and prevent neglect and abuse of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These comments have not aged well. If the commission has real teeth, then why did Ann-Marie's service provider only receive a fine of $12,600 after allowing her carer to neglect her so severely? If the commission has real regulatory powers and functions, why wasn't it overseeing the care that Ann-Marie was meant to be receiving? The government must provide answers to these questions and outline what it intends to do to ensure that the commission's powers are being properly used to prevent abuse and neglect, not just issue a slap on the wrist after the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS scheme is a vital national service. After seven years of the Morrison-Turnbull-Abbott government, I believe it's been slashed and mismanaged to such an extent that people are now, as we're seeing, being neglected. I want to see the minister getting real and start acting in the interests of Australians with disabilities. Australians pay their taxes. As we've heard, we cannot have a strong economy without delivering the services that people need. When it comes to the NDIS we're not delivering the services that people need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was relieved to see that the Morrison government heeded our calls for an independent investigation into the death of Ms Smith. The loved ones of Ms Smith deserve to know that others will not be similar kinds of victims of a failing system. It's a good start. The current scope of the inquiryâ€”the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's regulation of the late Ms Smith's service provider, Integrity Careâ€”was clearly too limited. The inquiry needed to be free to look at broader considerations, such as whether the $30 million a year commission has been a toothless watchdog across multiple cases, where the deaths in home by neglect of NDIS participants has been exasperated by the removal of $4.6 billion from the scheme, or underspend as the government likes to say. When I use that term in my communityâ€”and I go to disability groups, parents and carersâ€”and say, 'You will never believe what happened. There was not the demand for $4.6 billion,' people are blown away and cannot accept that that is any way in reality. Maybe I'm in an alternative universe to those opposite. When I meet with advocates they have no belief that the demand is not there. Maybe we need to work on some of the language there about an underspend versus, perhaps, in my opinion, mismanagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole range of findings that I know the government will have to deal with, but my final message today to the government is: please start listening to the sector. Make sure that their voices are heard. We need to continue to keep working on this scheme. It is far from perfect. It is a scheme that is benefiting tens of thousands of Australians. I know the joy that you hear from parents, in particular when they see their loved ones being able to participate in social activities or in the broader community, cannot be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I have achieved anything today, I'm hopeful that the minister will take onboard some of these concerns. Being the charitable person that I am, I will again forward my correspondence to him. I hope that after today we do get to sit down. It might have taken a year, but at least today we might see a meeting occur, so my residents can let him know their concerns directly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020 and support the amendments moved by the member for Barton. I'm pleased to follow my colleague the member for Oxley and recognise his advocacy for the vulnerable people and those living with disability and their families and carers in his community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks, as others have mentioned, to broaden the circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner may make a banning order against a provider or person and clarifies the commissioner's powers. The bill addresses some timing issues and shortfalls in the NDIS commissioner's ability to make banning orders against a worker who is no longer employed or engaged by an NDIS provider. The commissioner's ability to make a pre-emptive banning order against a person who has been identified as unsuitable to work with people with disability as a result of their actions in another field is also addressed. The changes allow the commission to make a banning order against a provider's former employee or staff and prevent the lapse of a banning order if the employer ceased to be engaged or the provider leaves the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will also empower the commissioner to include details of the order, including enough information to identify the person in the publicly available NDIS provider register. While I acknowledge the government's intention to address specific areas where the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner's powers are too narrow, it has taken the government two years to act and introduce this amendment to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has monitoring powers under the regulatory powers act to enter premises voluntarily to administer the NDIS Act and to seek monitoring warrants if entry is refused. The commission has significant powers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act to issue compliance notices, injunctions or civil penalties or vary, revoke or suspend registration of providers or make a banning order prohibiting or restricting specified activities by a provider or a person employed or otherwise engaged by a provider.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If only that were so. However, in the last two years there have been 2,473 complaints made to the commission, and the commission has only issued 23 banning orders. It's clear the commission is not exercising the full extent of its monitoring powers nor its powers to penalise non-compliant providers, and this is putting vulnerable people at risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recent tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Ann-Marie Smith in South Australia have highlighted just how important it is to have the strongest possible protections available for NDIS participants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others have noted in this House, Ann-Marie Smith's death is a tragedy. While supportive of the changes, the bill does not address the underlying problems. Importantly, even if these amendments were in place at the time, they would not have prevented Ann-Marie's death. The change proposed by the government to make a pre-emptive banning order against a person identified as unsuitable to work with people with disability as a result of their actions in another field would have prevented Ann-Marie's carer from becoming her carer, but there is no guarantee that her death would have been prevented as the bill does not contain measures addressing the lack of oversight which could allow any carer to perpetrate similar abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is vital. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is lifting the quality of life of so many Australians living with disability for their carers, for their families and for their loved ones, but it is falling short and, tragically, the mismanagement and underinvestment by this government has sadly led to the death of Ann-Marie Smith and to the neglect of many others who are in the care of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor was relieved when the government heeded our calls for an independent investigation into Ann-Marie Smith's death. Labor called on the government to broaden the inquiry to review the case of David Harris, whom other people have mentioned, an NDIS participant who was found dead in his house more than two months after his supports had been cut off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we recognise the inquiry was a good start, it has fallen short and it is clearly too limited. The inquiry needed to be free to look at broader considerations, such as whether the $30 million-a-year commission has been a toothless watchdog across multiple casesâ€”not just the case that has brought this amendment to the House, not just the case of Ms Smith's providerâ€”where the deaths in home by neglect of NDIS participants have been exacerbated by the removal of $4.6 billion from this scheme, as so many others have mentioned. When we have so many vulnerable people, so many people waiting for the support that they need, when we have seen so many delays, when we have seen so many errors, how can this government stand by and allow this to happen? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There also remains a clear conflict of the commission appointing the investigator and the investigator reporting back to the subject of their inquiry. The investigator needed subpoena powers, and disability advocates should be supported if they wish to engage with the process. We welcome the appointment of the investigator, who is, at least ostensibly, separate from the NDIA, but this is not enough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the Robertson report was released at the end of August. The review found there was no wrongdoing when the commission set out to protect NDIS participants and issued a meagre fine of $12,600 for failing to notify the commission of Ann-Marie's tragic death. We now know that this is the only infringement the commission has issued in two years of operatingâ€”the only infringement. During the coronavirus pandemic, the commission has contacted NDIS participants on only one occasion, in a joint letter that participants received in early September. Disturbingly, witnesses at the recent hearing of the inquiry into the NDIS commission overwhelmingly told the NDIS joint standing committee that most people have never heard of the NDIS commission. Most people don't know it exists. How can people receive support from it if they don't know it's there to protect them? How does this work in practice if a person has an issue with their provider but doesn't know that they can get support through the commission? They don't know it exists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS commission only regulates providers, and the NDIA is set up to administer the scheme to participants. Justice Robertson says the two agencies are not sharing information and acknowledges that, without this communication, people could easily fall through the cracks between these silos. The government has a responsibility that it can't walk away fromâ€”a responsibility to help NDIS participants understand the role of the commission and their rights if they experience problems with their providers. But, sadly, after years of funding cuts and neglect and mismanagement, people are dying of neglect in their homes and not receiving the support they deserve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to turn to some local examples. I know so many of us have had so many people come to us when they have been let down, when they haven't received the support that they deserve and that they need. Wendy from Chittaway Bay in my electorate needed home modifications for her wheelchair so that she should stay independent in her home. She applied for NDIS funding. As a participant, there were several quotes presented to the NDIA. The quotes ranged from $41,200 to $80,000. The agency settled on the lowest quote, despite Wendy's concerns about the builder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the building work started, Wendy did the right thing and contacted the local council about certification and was advised the builder hadn't submitted a construction certificate. Wendy was then faced with threats from the builder to pull the modifications down. She then lodged an application with New South Wales Fair Trading and, later, NCAT. When consent orders of $65,000 were reached, the builder made an admissionâ€”he wasn't qualified to do the home modifications and had no builders home insurance. This was the builder the agency had chosen to do the modifications on Wendy's home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been ongoing for five years, and Wendy had been left with a house that's considered unsafe because it can't be certified, and unsaleable. She's also been billed almost $15,000 in pursuing this through an NDIA recommended lawyer. Because of the choice of the builder by the NDIA, Wendy has been through New South Wales Fair Trading, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, and NCAT and is living with the personal and financial consequences of this mistake. It shouldn't be so hard for somebody like Wendy to get the home modifications she needs to be independent and safe within her own home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to Margaret from Bateau Bay. She recently contacted my office concerning her prosthetic limb, which was provided under her NDIS plan. It's a prosthetic leg that doesn't fit. After trying to negotiate with the provider, she's been asked, personally, to pay more to fix the prosthesis. This is money that Margaret doesn't have and shouldn't have to pay. Mistakes happen. But, when they do, processes should be in place to fix them, and people like Margaret should not have to foot the bill to pay for the NDIA's mistakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm now going to turn to carers, because we know that so many carers have been so impacted through COVID-19, and carers of people living with disability, particularly children with disability, have been particularly vulnerable. Next week, as we know, is National Carers Week. I would like to thank all of those carers across Australia for the unpaid care that they provide so generously and without any recognition. They deserve to be acknowledged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the NDIA fails, it's not just participants that are affected; it's their families and carers that are impacted as well. A recent survey by Mental Health Carers Australia on the impacts of COVID-19 on NDIS participants with psychosocial disability found provision of NDIS supports for participants, families and carers had dropped significantly. Sixty-one per cent said lockdown had impacted NDIS supports they'd received, and 80 per cent had not been in contact with their NDIA provider regarding their plan. The survey found families and carers had stepped into the breach left by providers and it was impacting their mental health. Seventy-five per cent of these carers were concerned about their family's mental health, and 65 per cent were concerned about their own emotional wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 50 per cent reported their caring roles increased significantly, to more than what they could cope with. Unsurprisingly, 73 per cent of these carers were aged over 50, and nearly all of the respondents to the survey were women. For many of them, the day-to-day expenses increased by over half, and most of these carers are retired or working part-time because of their caring responsibilities. Finally, the survey found that carers were an at-risk group: more vulnerable to COVID and more likely to be struggling financially. These figures provide just a snapshot, a little insight, into the carers of people receiving NDIS support for psychosocial disability. They reflect the strain being felt by the wider carer community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Caring Fairly Coalition <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring during coronavirus</span> survey highlighted the impact of the virus on the carer community. Sixty per cent of carers reported losing some or all of the support for the services for the person that they cared for, and four in five said that their mental health had deteriorated since COVID-19. Nearly 90 per cent had experienced increased stress in their role as a carer, and close to 40 per cent reported losing some or all of their regular income. Given these impacts, it's no surprise that less than six per cent of carers reported that the Australian government was providing enough support for carers during the pandemic. It's not hard to see why carers feel overlooked. It's not hard to see why carers feel they've been left behind. Unpaid carers, Minister, should not have to pick up the slack for the government's failure to manage the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was built by Labor. Since it was introduced, it has helped people across Australia living with disability to have a better quality of life. However, over the past seven years, it has been mismanaged. It has been neglected. Peopleâ€”sadly, tragicallyâ€”have died of neglect in their own homes. People in my community have been left behind. People in my community are struggling. People in my community who are living with disability have been overlooked by this government. And it's people in my community and their circumstances that reflect those of people across Australia. People living with disability and their families and carers have been left behind by this government, Minister. They deserve better. Nobody should be left behind by this government. No vulnerable person, particularly during COVID-19, should be left desperate to the point that they believe their own mental health and wellbeing are at risk because of their disability or because of their caring responsibilities. It is not good enough, Minister. They deserve better. They deserve better from you, and they deserve better from this government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. On behalf of the people of Corangamite, I do welcome the introduction of this amendment to the legislation that underpins the National Disability Insurance Scheme. However, it must be said that this amendment is, tragically, too little too late. For countless NDIS participants a lack of safeguards and protections has resulted in significant suffering and death, and this has happened under the Morrison-McCormack government's watch. While this bill will permit a commissioner of the scheme to place a ban on a former employee under the NDIS, this amendment will not bring Ann-Marie Smith back. This system and the Morrison government failed Ms Smith in the most egregious way. The bill will also identify staff that have clearly breached acceptable conduct. But, again, this amendment has been introduced after the horse has bolted. Too many people have suffered. Too many people have died. We need the watchdog to wake up and do its job and protect our most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie was an NDIS participant. She was a 54-year-old Adelaide resident who died earlier this year of severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected with her cerebral palsy after being confined to a cane chair for more than a year. What a shocking indictment on the Morrison government's inept management of the NDIS system. The minister must take responsibility for this shocking tragedy. To give the provider a banning order and fine them $12,600 is woefully underdone. Is this how much Ann-Marie Smith's life was worth? It is insulting, disrespectful and pathetic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie Smith is not the only participant who has suffered due to the watchdog's underperformance. David Harris suffered from schizophrenia and diabetes. After being excluded from the NDIS because he missed an annual review, Mr Harris was found dead in his Parramatta home. He had died two months earlier. Another 12,000 Australians with disability have died while waiting to be funded by the scheme. Ann-Marie Smith's death was a tragedy. David Harris's death was a tragedy. They were both preventable. These deaths need to be approached with remorse, reflection and an honest, heartfelt commitment to do things better. The Morrison government must do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the government has undertaken an independent investigation into Ann-Marie Smith's death, but this only occurred after the shadow minister and the disability community applied significant pressure. And it should be noted the scope of the review only extended to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's regulation. This was far too narrow an investigation. The inquiry should have taken a broader view, including the events leading to David Harris's death and the other victims of insufficient safeguards within the system. A more earnest investigation would include why current monitoring has failed, and what impact $4.6 billion in funding cuts under the Morrison-McCormack government has had on the system's capacity to do its job. The investigator did not have, but should have had, subpoena power to conduct the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Federal Court Justice Alan Robertson's review into Ms Ann-Marie Smith's death included clear recommendations to improve oversight of the NDIS provision. These included: identification of people with disability who are vulnerable to harm and neglect; a crosscheck of care provision by having more than one carer for vulnerable people; a clear identification of the primary responsible carer of every vulnerable person; a community visit scheme; spot checks; clearer reporting requirements; and better and more communication between state and territory emergency services, the NDIA and the commission. Justice Robertson's report also highlighted an unproductive blame culture between the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. Importantly, it found that the two agencies are not sharing information, and people can easily fall through the cracks of government bureaucracy. These are clear instructions to this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should not be lost on us that throughout the coronavirus pandemic the commission has only reached out to NDIS participants once. This was in a joint letter only sent to participants early last month. The NDIS joint parliamentary standing committee, of which I'm a member, was very concerned by witness testimony that the NDIS commission was not known to participants and carers that most depend on its work. We cannot be surprised the scheme is not adequately looking after participants, when participants do not know how the safeguards work and who they should turn to when they do have a concern. Even where participants know and engage with the commission, more than one-third of their complaints hit a dead end, without further action. This is the failure of half-measures and a system that does not adequately monitor, evaluate and act on its own failings. The Robertson review has made it clear that the government must reform the functions, powers and capacity of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to respond to the concerns and complaints of NDIS participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, many carers and people with disabilities have contacted me with their concerns about the NDIS. Because of this, I have formed my own reference group, who come to me regularly to discuss the issues and suggest how we can improve the system. One example is the case of a six-year-old boy with a long and complex medical history who has had issues with the NDIS. He was rejected for respite care twice, even though the NDIA agreed he qualified for support, given his situation. It is now under review, following advocacy from my office. It is still under review, but it should not have to take the intervention of a federal MP for participants to get the help and support they need. This is just one example of a system that has not accurately assessed the needs of participants. The result is ongoing anguish, anxiety and exhaustion for many participants and their families and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an unacceptable moral failing for this House to presume that everyone who receives support from the NDIS is in a position to speak out when they need to. The system should be built to help people reach out when they need help, not make it harder for them. It needs clearer inbuilt protections to support our most vulnerable. The Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme has commented that we need the strongest possible protections to be available for participants. The Labor Party couldn't agree more. Australians couldn't agree more. So here's the question: where are the protections? True to form, the Morrison-McCormack government has responded to public outcry with aggressive commentary but little actionâ€”all announcement, no delivery. It is not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, individuals and families in my electorate, who I proudly represent, depend on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Carers and families do a great job, and I would like to take the time to acknowledge all the carers out there who work so well and so diligently to support people with disability. More than a quarter of a million Australians access the NDIS. It is not good enough to tinker around the edges with amendments to laws that sound well targeted but fail to deliver desperately needed reform. A properly functioning support structure for people with disability is not an add-on; it is not a luxury. It is an investment and it is an absolute necessity to ensure we protect our most vulnerable. We owe it to all Australians to get this system right.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a vital national service, intended to be the most significant economic and social reform in Australia for more than a generation. Unfortunately, the NDIS has not lived up to its full potential of delivery of quality services to people with disability. Mismanagement at the hands of this government has meant that we are still tinkering with the legislation, still amending the scheme, still hearing far too many horror stories of people falling through the cracks. Minister Robert has so far presided over $4.6 billion being ripped out of the NDIS and 1,200 Australians with disability dying while waiting to be funded by this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 8,000 NDIS participants in Tasmania, more than a third of whom reside in the Derwent Valley in my electorate. It is of the greatest concern to me that even one of these people may not be getting the support and services they need or, worse, that there may be incidents of serious injury, abuse or neglect that are going unreported or ignored because of systemic failures. Recently my office had the opportunity to meet with Greg Harwood, a director of Access Coordination Tasmania. I sincerely thank Greg for sharing his knowledge and expertise and helping me and my staff better understand the issues facing the NDIS, especially in Tasmania. Greg and his partner, Suzie Marston, operate Access Coordination Tasmania, a small NDIS provider based in regional Tasmania primarily delivering NDIS support coordination and service development to NDIS participants. Greg explained that a large part of the business for their eight staff is working towards getting people's NDIS plans up and running within eight weeks of the plan being approved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was shocked, dismayed and angered to learn that it is not uncommon to have months of delays in plans being implemented. One young family, who have had their son's NDIS plan in place since December 2019, was only recently referred to Access Coordination Tasmania and connected with support coordination. That's nine long months in which funding has been parked, of no benefit to anyoneâ€”nine months of uncertainty. I'm told that this plan will now have to be reviewed to meet their needs. It just is not good enough. Unfortunately, delays such as this are inevitable when the system is so drastically underresourced. Working day to day on the ground in the sector, Greg said it was clear that the disability workforce is increasingly casualised and reliant on frontline staff who may not have the training, experience or support to deal with high-risk clients. I have previously mentioned in this place concerns raised by the Health and Community Services Union, which represents disability workers, that work in the disability sector is increasingly insecure because of the nature of the NDIS model, where fixed-term contracts and yearly funding reviews are industry standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the intention of the proposed amendments to the NDIS Act, from the Tune report, is to address the length of plans. However, we are yet to see that this will be the case. This is a workforce that has often been undersupervised, working across multiple locations and without the oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that reporting and regulatory requirements are properly carried out. The government has not invested in the workforce or the infrastructure that supports that workforce to make this scheme work as well as it could and should. We know that frontline staff such as disability and aged-care workers are some of the lowest-paid in this country. Overwhelmingly they are women. Yet we place them in extremely physically demanding and high-stress situations where they are responsible for the welfare of our most vulnerable citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agency and NDIA staff are also impacted. One of the main complaints to my office is that there is no consistency for clients as to whom they deal with through the NDIS. It's a lottery on the phone. This is very much a consequence of the federal government's decision to understaff the NDIA, with 3Â½ thousand staff when it commenced instead of the Productivity Commission's recommendation of a minimum of 10,000 staff nationally. Families might deal with three or four people about their plan and have to explain the same issues over and over again. The gap between people who have local area coordination services, and agency assigned planners, and those who need to move between them creates much of that turbulence. A high turnover of staff, minimal training and a huge volume of work for agency staff means it is just not possible to develop specialist knowledge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access Coordination Tasmania suggests there should be planners in every region and they should have more specific training and knowledge of the most common and challenging disabilities in their regions: local knowledge on the ground. In Tasmania, as well as having impacts on the workforce, under-resourcing also means there are a lack of facilities and services within the community that provide the specialist disability supports and care that many people accessing the NDIS require. In particular, a severe shortage of high-support-needs short-term accommodation for people with challenging behaviours results in families with no support options. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the 8,858 NDIS clients in Tasmania end up in hospital because appropriate discharge and specialist supports in accommodation are not readily available. This has been exacerbated by the impacts of COVID-19. NDIS clients were rushed out of hospital and into accommodation that was intended for that purpose. One respite centre in the north of Hobart, for example, has been reportedly full for more than four months, preventing others from accessing this serviceâ€”even though it does not provide the high-needs services that many of these clients need, which is why they're in hospital or other settings in the first place. Another example is the lack of readily available respite for people with motor neuron disease or Huntington's disease, despite Huntington's in Tasmania representing the second-largest cluster of people in the world with this disease. Access Coordination Tasmania spent last year working to find suitable short-term accommodation for one participant who has been in the Royal Hobart Hospital for seven months, waiting for respite. The pandemic has further highlighted this issue of a lack of facilities and supports available to people with a disability and their families within the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For service providers such as Access Coordination Tasmania, so many of the ongoing issues with the scheme come down to underresourcing of the workforce, of the agency, and of educating the mainstream community about what the NDIS does. Greg made the point that this particular social reform, the implementation of the NDIS, lacked public messaging or effective advertising about the scheme, undermining its very intention of supporting Australians with a disability to fully participate in mainstream society. The lack of understanding from the general communityâ€”despite the general community having an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards the NDIS as a wholeâ€”and particularly from mainstream support services about the responsibilities of the NDIS is one of the main issues that face providers like Access Coordination Tasmania every day. The government simply hasn't done enough to inform people what about the NDIS does, and how it does it, and what it should be doing. Greg said that he often must explain to mainstream servicesâ€”like housing, justice, aged care, home services and mental health et cetera, agencies that should be better informedâ€”just what client responsibilities are theirs and what the responsibilities are of the NDIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, for example, a client of Greg's with Huntington's was returning home to Tasmania from Queensland and was required to undertake 14 days of hotel quarantine. Access Coordination Tasmania contacted the state government to advise the state controller of the specialist needs and support required for this client. Unfortunately, those required supports were not put in place and the end result was this gentleman being put in a taxi and sent home. Greg says this is just one of the many examples he has where mainstream services are not clear on what their duties are. Instead, they expect NDIS to take on a responsibility that may not be theirs and, ultimately, leave a client without the support or care they need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Carers Tasmania 2019 NDIS satisfaction survey tells a similar story. There are still many carers who appear to be overwhelmed, distressed and/or disillusioned with their experience with the NDIS. More than 20 per cent said that there had been little or no improvement since they first engaged with the NDIS and 75 per cent of those caring for a person assessed as ineligible for the NDIS stated that they had no contact with the local area coordinator, despite the fact that one of the roles of a local area coordinator is to assist those ineligible people to access supports in the community. Carers feel dismissed, unclear about how they can be involved and unsure where they fit in a system designed to give the person with the disability choice and control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a step in the right direction, but it is clear that there are fundamental systemic issues within the NDIS that need to be urgently addressed. I note that the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission report into the death of Ms Smith suggests that steps need to be taken: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ to identify earlier those people with disability who are vulnerable to harm or neglect. Every stage of decision-making, including corrective regulation, should be alive to factors indicating that a participant may be vulnerable to harm or neglect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦Â Â Â â€¦Â Â Â â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) No vulnerable NDIS participant should have a sole carer providing services in the participant's own home. The relevant statutory instruments and guidelines should be amended to provide expressly for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(3) For each vulnerable NDIS participant, there should be a specific person with overall responsibility for that participant's safety and wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are broader questions too that need to be addressed. From what I am hearing from providers and NDIS clients there is certainly an argument to be made that the role of the commission can be strengthened. Access Coordination Tasmania would like to see more regular community visits from the commission, including random spot checks and an improved feedback system. Participants living on their own or with a single parent should receive higher amounts of diverse supports and not rely on a single service to own that responsibility. The government must provide answers and outline what it intends to do to ensure that the commission's powers are being properly used to prevent abuse and neglect, not just issue a slap on the wrist after the fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a vital national service, but after seven years of Liberal rule and mismanagement it has been slashed and mismanaged to such an extent that people are literally dying of neglect in their homes. The minister needs to get real and start acting in the interests of Australians with a disability. Australians pay their taxes so that when they are vulnerable they are not left to die in squalor. This kind of system failure resulting in death by neglect needs to be approached head on with honesty, genuine reform and enough money to get the job done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  The NDIS was designed by Labor to empower people with disabilities to make their own decisions about the care that best supports them and their goals. For that to occur many things have to go right. Many systems have to be functioning effectively so that the support packages people receive are fair and tailored to their needs. There also has to be effective oversight and safeguards to ensure that when people are not treated fairly there is an appeals process that delivers fairnessâ€”and I'll speak more about that a bit later. Those protections and safeguards also have to include the providers of care and the staff that they employ.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People living with a disability and their families need to know that serious injury, abuse, neglect, unauthorised restraint or, at the very worst, death will not go unnoticed or unpunished. Recent very public and tragic cases have demonstrated that to date those safeguards simply have not been in place. The death of Ann-Marie Smithâ€”a woman close to my own age who was living in Adelaide and died of severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected with her cerebral palsy after being stuck in a cane chair for 24 hours a day for more than a yearâ€”tells us that something is seriously wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Her NDIS package included six hours of support every day. The evidence indicates that she received only two hours of care a day and may not have left her home for years. How this happened, without anyone knowing about it or doing something about it, beggars belief. This woman was not given a chance to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also the nightmare of every parent with an adult child with a disability. I remember back to the years between 2010 and 2013 and the discussions about this new NDIS system, and how it might work, that I had with many people who either had a disability or cared for a child with a disability, and that child might have been an adult. While it was clear that parents with young children were just swamped by the need to provide the best possible early interventions and were faced with the relentlessness of caring, there was another group of parents who were worn down not just by years of care but by decades of it. They were the aging parents of an adult child with a disability. Their stories were heartbreaking. A very common scenario was that they really felt they had only two options before the NDISâ€”that, generally, at least one of them had to give up a full-time job to be a full-time carer. This had the effect of drastically reducing their income, which, over time, pushed them into poverty. Their other option was to relinquish care of an adult child into a group home, which many felt they were just unable to do, or did so with enormous guilt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These were very common stories that I heard as the NDIS was being formed. What they all said to me was that they weren't worried about the fact that they were exhausted. That was okayâ€”they very generously provided care for their child. They weren't so worried even about their own health. They recognised that that was a consequence of the load they were carrying. The last of their concerns was not having money. But they were worried about what would happen to their son or daughter if they died first. That was the most oft-spoken phrase to me. What keeps them awake at night is the thought of who is going to look after the childâ€”and the child may be in their 30s, 40s or 50s. I heard this from parents who were in their 80s, their 60s and their 40s. They could see a future without a scheme like the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing secure residential care, supports with dignity and allowing people to live in their own home, the home of their choice, were an absolutely prime and fundamental objective of the NDIS. But in the way the system has been implemented it has failed people. It certainly failed Ann-Marie Smith. To my mind, that means the minister has failed Ann-Marie Smith. The fact that, following the investigations that looked into this case, the service provider received a fine of $12,600 after allowing the carer to neglect her so severely, tells you that this legislation today is desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the case of David Harris in Parramatta, who died after his NDIS payments were cut off. That also needs serious investigation to understand the systemic flaws that led to it happening. David was also around my age. He suffered schizophrenia, was diabetic and incontinent and needed regular injections and he missed an annual review meeting. This meant that his funding was simply cut off and his cleaners and other NDIS funded support just stopped. It simply stopped and no-one thought, 'What's the consequence of this for David?' This is the stuff of nightmares that families in my electorate are going through. They're concerned about plans being ended and there being no plan in place. They lie awake at night worrying about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to talk about some of the things I'm currently seeing in my electorate, but I also want to point out the banning orders. When we hear cases like this, it is just staggering that only 13 banning orders have been made in the last 18 monthsâ€”1,422 complaints and 13 banning orders. We don't really know the details of the neglect or the abuse in any of the complaints that were made. The lack of transparency is frightening. The only way schemes like this function is with transparencyâ€”transparency and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke with an NDIS participant today. She confirmed with me that she and others who are friends who have packages have had to make complaints to providers about carers. She had a circumstance where one provider tried to sell her mother a house that this young woman could live in, when the young woman had already declined that offer. There are flaws that run through this, and if we don't get it right for those serious cases it just goes all the way through the system. I'm all for this legislation supporting far greater scrutiny and protections, and I would like to see other checks and balances put in place to ensure that there is respect for people, that they have the choice that this scheme's designed to give them and that they have control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some of the circumstances that we're seeing right now with the NDIS. I'm going to talk about a couple of screaming flaws that this legislation certainly doesn't go anywhere near addressing. This really goes to the fear of the consequence of missing a review or failing in a piece of paperwork that's required. The system is so heavily dependent on forms being filled in, procedures being followed that can seem so opaque to people, reports being made and reports that are missing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give you an example that Sandy has shared with me. Sandy is an incredible advocate for people with disabilities, for carers and for children with disabilities. She has a nine-year-old daughter, Imogen. Imogen has multiple diagnoses, including autism and ADHD. It is a very complex mix of things. Imogen communicates using words and picture cards. She's mostly non-verbal, but she has a very fierce routine that she relies upon and that Sandy relies upon. Recently, Sandy talked to me about the fact that their plan was due for renewal. She was thrilled to be told by the NDIA that she wouldn't require a full review and that she would be able to roll her plan over. It would just be a phone interview and some basic documents that she would need to upload. She was told that this was a formality only and that the plan would be approved on a like-for-like capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, on the very day that the plan was to expire, she was told that the NDIA did not think the supports Imogen relied on last year were reasonable, necessary or good value and that a behavioural plan had to be in place before any decision could be made. This is on the very day that her plan was about to run out. A mother who has gone through this year after year was, for the first time, being told that it could roll over, and she knew the progress her daughter was making. What's more, her doctors knew the progress her daughter was making; it was all documented. And, as it turns out, there was a behavioural plan in placeâ€”a 49-page document that had been facilitated through Imogen's school. The NDIA were unaware that it even existed because they had failed to provide funding for it in previous plans. So there you go; that's what a mother was facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been able to ensure that Imogen's plan has been provided for the next three months. It has been extended so that further evidence can be given to the NDIA. To put parents through this sort of agony as their child's plan expires is an absolute disgrace and a fundamental flaw in the way the system is workingâ€”or, quite frankly, not working. Sandy's case is not the only one; I get these situations happening time after time. While we welcome the legislation today, what we need to see is a far greater review of how the NDIS is working to ensure that parents are not put through absolute agony time after time and are not asked to film their children's behaviour as evidence. When a child is suffering, the last thing a parent needs to do is get out the camera on their phone and film it. They need to have the freedom to comfort their child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time the NDIS was designed to support people with disabilities and their carers so they are able to do what's right for those people, whether they're young children or older children. The legislation today is welcome, but it falls well short of what we need to see this government doing to bring decency to the treatment of people with disabilities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  [by video link] When you boil Mr Morrison's budget down, it's a plan for a trillion dollars of debt with no plan for how to get us out of it. This Liberal Party that once carried on hysterically about what they called a debt and deficit disaster is now delivering our nation unprecedented debt and deficit, extending as far as the eye can see. Australians are right to ask: 'Are we getting bang for our trillion bucks? Will that money be spent wisely?' Right now, it doesn't look like it. Is there money for child care to help parents with young children to get back to work? No. Is there money for schools? No. Is there money for TAFE training? No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do know how much the Morrison government has misused taxpayers' money. Last month, the Morrison government was caught paying more than 10 times market value for airport land, and, coincidently, a Liberal Party donor was the beneficiary. They spent over $100 million on the unlawful sports rorts last year and have tried to sweep that scandal under the carpet too. We only know about these scandals because of the vital work of the independent Auditor-General, who scrutinises the government's spending. Now that the Morrison government is about to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more, you would think the Auditor-General would receive additional funding to try to ensure that money is spent properly. But has that happened? Of course it hasn't. The Auditor-General's funding has been cut in this budget, because, more than anything, this Prime Minister and his ministers hate scrutiny and hate accountability. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's not safe and it's not fit for purpose when the purpose is bringing the country out of the COVID-19 recession. The Bruce Highway needs to be four lanes to efficiently transport livestock from the farms to the processors to the supermarkets, to transport goods from manufacturers to market and to ensure that our tourist industry is vibrant and people can travel safely on our roads.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to start by making the Tiaro Bypass in Wide Bay four lanes. Unfortunately, the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mark Bailey, says there's no issue with gridlock or hold-ups on this section of highway, and he refuses to bring a plan forward to the Commonwealth to four lane the highway. This is in great contrast to the experience of people living in the area who suffer the daily traffic jams that are imposed upon them by this highway.</span>

It particularly leaves behind those older Australians who are expecting the federal government to respond to its own royal commission into aged care. Critically, the very first interim recommendation for aged care was to fix the home-care packages waitlist. But what did we see last night? We saw 23,000 home-care packages. For the last two years, there have been over 100,000 older Australians, who have been approved for care, waiting for care. Sadly, what we've seen is over 30,000 older Australians die in the last three years waiting for their package without the care they need. It is an absolute tragedy, and the government should have done more. The government has had the recommendations of that royal commission interim report now for 12 months. Then, of course, we have seen the outbreak of COVID in residential aged care, to which the government has more recommendations. Those too should have been dealt with much, much earlier. What we're hearing from the government is that they want to wait until the royal commission's final report in February to act. It will be sadly far too late for far too many older Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Set over 13 hectares, Wittunga was created by Mr Edwin Ashby in 1902 and showcases waterwise Australian native plants as well as many from South Africa. In the 1920s, Mr Ashby developed raised sandy garden beds and a unique watering system to promote drainage and replicate growing conditions he'd seen in Western Australia. At Wittunga you can find a wide range of rare plant species from Western Australia, Kangaroo Island and the Fleurieu Peninsula and hundreds of species of hakeas, banksias, myrtles and gums as well as many other rare native plants.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, along with many wonderful local volunteers who support the gardens, I visited Wittunga to see recent upgrades, made possible thanks to $750,000 of funding from the Morrison government. The lakeside has been cleared of invasive weeds and replanted with native plants, and the lakeside walking trail and beach have been upgraded. The state minister for the environment, David Speirs, and the member for Waite, Sam Duluk, announced that Wittunga will now have extended opening hours so that families and visitors can enjoy these stunning gardens for longer each day, especially when the brand new nature play area has been built, thanks to the $750,000 of federal government funding. I know that principal Kris Robson, staff, students and families at the neighbouring Blackwood Primary School are particularly excited about this, especially as they helped design the new nature play area. Thanks to everyone involved. We can't wait to see these upgrades happen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  [by video link] We need to invest in our public servants and not hand their roles to private companies for profit. It is the Public Service, with its developed processes, corporate knowledge and culture, that enables good governance, accountability and high-quality service provision and can always be counted on to put the public interest first. So imagine the community's dismay that the privatisation of the Australian Public Service is continuing at a staggering rate. For instance, documents obtained by michaelwest.com.au show that the number of outsourced staff in Defence is 1Â½ times the number of public servants. The Attorney-General's Department spent $13.4 million on labour hire contractors last financial year. Home Affairs outsourced 1,082 positions, including intelligence analysts, legal practitioners and border enforcement officers. Nearly 40 per cent of department of infrastructure staff is outsourced, including 16 assistant directors, and 5,000 positions in the ATO's call centres are outsourced. Frankly, there's simply no transparency in outsourced arrangements, no certainty that information is protected and no guarantee that the highest quality services will be delivered. About the only thing that's for sure is that the contract workers will be worse off than their predecessors and that their employers will pocket tidy profits, all of which is a nonsense. It must end.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to two outstanding Western Australians who passed away this year, Mr Terry O'Connor AM, QC and Dr Michael Quinlan AO. The contributions and service of both men to their professions and to our society more broadly mean that their impact extends far beyond the time and place in which they lived. I was fortunate to know both men through the University of Notre Dame Australia, a university which both men were instrumental in creating and developing. Both men served for years on the governing boards, including at times as chancellor, and both gave so much to the institution without ever asking for anything in return.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr O'Connor, who died in April, was a barrister by profession, a fearless fighter for the things he believed in and a supporter of many causes and organisations. He left behind his wife, Annabel; his children, Dimity and Simon, and their partners; and his five grandchildren. Dr Michael Quinlan, who passed away last weekend, was a physician who healed and saved many lives throughout his professional career. He was a giant of the medical profession who also gave service to numerous organisations in WA. Michael leaves behind his wife, Carole; his children, Tim, Peter, Anthony, Annabelle and Gaby, and their partners; and his 14 grandchildren. They were both exceptional men of integrity, love, faith and compassion. They loved and served God, their families and their neighbours, and they were much loved in return. May they rest in peace.</span>

My community is crying out for investment from this government. We've been plagued by historically above average unemployment and underemployment, and Macarthur residents are doing it tough in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Far from providing support to my community, the government is starving it and stifling economic growth. If the government cared about the rapidly growing south-west of Sydney, they would finally fund the desperately needed rail line from Macarthur to the new Western Sydney airport. This would support the new airport and the families and businesses around it and provide a freight line to take freight from other businesses in Sydney to the new airport.</span>

The government is leaving Macarthur residents behind, and I will not stand by and listen to those opposite champion their abysmal budget as a success. For Macarthur residents, it is a disaster and a travesty. We need infrastructure and we need it now.</span>

Tenterfield issues such as the Bolivia Hill realignment, the Legume-to-Woodenbong road, Carrara Bridge and Emu Swamp Creek were at the centre of her delivery back to her nation and to her local community via her involvement in a political party.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Today I want to give a massive shout-out to the mighty Western Magic AFL club women's team who notched up a grand final win in the AFL Sydney Women's Division Two 2020 season on Sunday 27 September. They were amazing competitors. They won every game they played, bar one. Earlier this year, sadly, they lost a member before the season began, and club president Mark Barclay said that was a galvanising inspiration for them. As I said, they lost only one game. They powered their way to the grand final match against the team at the top of the table, St George, at Rosedale Park. They were unstoppable from the start. They smashed out a 59-point win. It was a stunning result. Mallorie Jansen was named player of the match, and Zarlie Goldsworthy and Tiarne Kleyn were also acknowledged for their work. They came from a diverse range of backgrounds, from the likes of Zarlie, who is just 16, through to players like Courtney Corr, who gave birth in June and just 10 weeks later returned to the field to play a big part in the grand final. It proves mums do it all. It is a family affair, because Courtney's twin, Jaimie, also played on the team. The club president, Mark, said the competitive spirit of the team coached by Aisha Firmer was like nothing they've ever seen. Obviously, preach that, President. Congratulations to the mighty Magic!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Nights like the 2020 Hornsby/Ku-ring-gai District RFS medal presentation are an important reminder of the extraordinary contribution that volunteers make to our country. Where would we be without them? The recent awards night was to recognise all those in our community receiving national medals and long service RFS medals. Being a recipient of a national medal or a New South Wales RFS long service medal is a great honour. More importantly, it's a well-deserved accolade for the many, many hours of unpaid work volunteers have offered the RFS throughout their service. The commitment each recipient has shown is extraordinary. Recipients of the national medal included Gus Gulicher, Chris Jobson, Lyn Cooper, Janet Fitzpatrick, Scott Ryrie, Anthea Roache, Tony Bright, Jack Stoner, James Leitch, Gordon Morgan, Michael Richter, Chris Cook and Stuart Clark OAMâ€”all of whom have served the RFS in various ways and have played critical roles in their brigades over the decades. Long service award recipients include Chris Cook, John Snook, Chris Robison, Tony Griffiths and Dave McMonniesâ€”who between them represent 144 years of service to the RFS.</span>

Our RFS volunteers from my area worked tirelessly during the bushfires with many deployed to various locations throughout the state. This is a great opportunity to recognise their service and say thank you. </span>

It's a huge spending budget, but the Territory is still losing out on Commonwealth funding, and that's going to make it even more difficult for us to recover our economy. If Territorians themselves are over 35 and have found themselves out of work through COVID, they're not included in the government's wage subsidies. Let's just think about that for a second. Territorians who are over 35â€”those with families, with kids, with mortgages, with responsibilitiesâ€”who are trying to get back into the job market, at Christmas time, are going to be left on $40 a day, old Newstart, to support their families. It's incredibly disappointing that Territorians, with some of the highest expenses, are not being given help with their childcare costs and they're not being assisted with wage subsidies if they're over 35 years of age. I feel for those Territorians. I can assure those with kids who want to get back into the workforce that federal Labor are committed to assistance with child care for those on lower wages, and that will be a great assistance to get our economy going again.</span>

This government is increasing women's workforce participation, improving earning potential and enhancing women's economic independence. This is fantastic for Australian women. As a single mother who worked hard in the business world, I understand that there are unique challenges faced only by women. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer recognise this and are delivering much-needed support. The Morrison government has committed $240 million to employment programs that support women's leadership, management and development. We are increasing opportunities for women in science, technology engineering, mathematics, business and male-dominated industries.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  There are many aspects of last night's budget that I want to explore further, but I'm going to start with just one, which I think is so glaringly obvious it beggars belief I even need to. Unemployed workers over the age of 35 years are getting nothing short of a raw deal in this budget. We know that the older you get the harder it is to retain and find a job. We know that unemployment has skyrocketed. In my electorate there are more than 10,000 jobseekers. But if you are over 35, under the coalition government, you will have your wage subsidy cut and then removed altogether from March. If you are receiving JobSeeker you are on track to be getting $40 a day again. There is no incentive for people to hire you. In fact, the opposite: people are incentivised to hire someone younger. This is just not good enough. My electorate has been to hell and back this year with drought, bushfires, floods and COVID-19. All of our workers need urgent support, but the government has turned its back on jobseekers over the age of 35. We need to focus on helping our workforce get back to work. We should be creating jobs, supporting local people and making sure no-one is left behind. But I see none of that for Gilmore. The government needs to fix this mess now. </span>

You are not alone. The Morrison government has made mental health and suicide prevention a national priority. Our government's investment in mental health is at $5.7 billion this year alone. This is to deal with the devastating impact that not only bushfires but coronavirus have had on our mental health. This includes $7 million provided by Medicare subsidised mental health services, which have been delivered since March, and support will increase. </span>

These additional sessions will be available for all Australians with a mental health care plan, regardless of their location. I have already received positive feedback from mental health professionals across the country, who have said that the additional 10 sessions will make a huge difference to the front line, particularly for people with complex cases. </span>

In the coming weeks, our government will receive recommendations from the Productivity Commission's mental health final report and the interim report into suicide prevention commissioned by the Prime Minister. We look forward to acting on these reports, alongside states and territories, so we can continue to provide life-saving mental health services for all Australians.</span>

They're chopping JobKeeper, uni fees are up by 113 per cent in a dirty deal with the South Australian crossbench, they've done the dirty on people over 35 looking for a job, and they're snapping back to $40 a day for those on JobSeeker. The Prime Minister used to lecture us in this place about a debt bomb! This is his 'TNT' budget: a $966 billion debt bomb. When it comes to climate change, they are 'dirty, mean and mighty unclean'. And if you were 'shaking all night long' and, as a result, nine months later had a child, there's nothing for child care. There is not a cent of extra initiatives for child care. They're even cutting the Local Schools Community Fund. That's a $200,000 cut for the Perth electorate. There's nothing more for my local schools. They're cutting all of your local schools as well as denying them funds. </span>

Australia needs an ACDC, and only Labor will deliver one. When it comes to the Prime Minister, he's not an AC/DC fan. He loves Tina Arena. He walks around whistling 'Wasn't It Good'.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Last night the Treasurer of Australia delivered one of the most important budgets in our country's history. The budget is about jobs. As the Treasurer said, there is no economic recovery without a jobs recovery. We have a plan to create jobs, deliver infrastructure upgrades and get behind our Australian manufacturers. Last week I joined members in our community to announce that the Commonwealth government will fully fund a $127 million upgrade of Dunheved Road. Having fought to secure the initial $63Â½ million during the election, I am so proud that we are funding this full upgrade so we can get families in our community to work and home again more safely and quickly. </span>

I've been working closely with our local manufacturers to address barriers and unlock opportunities with my advanced manufacturing task force. We're working hard to get Western Sydney ahead when it comes to manufacturing. Grant Engineered, GPC Electronics, SpanSet Plustec and J Sinclair Engineering are working with me, together, to create jobs for our local community in manufacturing and to take the best of the opportunities coming for advanced manufacturing in the future.</span>

You also probably remember that the Liberals and the Nationals ended up voting with One Nation in relation to that motion, which they later apologised for. Perhaps not content with that as an example, the Queensland Liberals and Nationals are going one better by encouraging Queenslanders to vote for parties like One Nation and the Greens ahead of Labor in every single seat at the state election at the end of this year.</span>

                  </a>  I hear a 'hear, hear' from over there. Let's just have a chat about this. They want the chaos of a minority government, of a hung parliament, more than they want stability for our state of Queensland. They would rather have a powerless Greens party crossbencher than an effective Labor government MP in seats like South Brisbane. And why wouldn't they? They would remember the time that the Greens and the Liberals teamed up to defeat the Rudd government's climate action. So why wouldn't they prefer a powerless Greens crossbencher to an effective state Labor MP like Jackie Trad? One Nation is the party that brought us the white supremacy inspired motion in the Senate, the moves to ban the burqa, wearing the burqa into the Senate to support that, and the maiden speech about being swamped by Asians. This is the party that the Liberals and Nationals in Queensland are asking you to vote for ahead of Labor. They ought to be ashamed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The Sunshine Coast is a big winner in this year's budget. Our region's average income is below the national median, which means the tax cuts will help thousands of hardworking locals and their families. Given that the region has one of Australia's oldest demographics, additional pension payments and home-care packages will improve the daily lives of so many seniors. Our biggest employer is the construction industry, and so the extended First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and other measures will support jobs in the thousands. Our tourism sector relies on the drive market, while hundreds of businesses transport their products down to Brisbane, and so the extra $95 million for local stretches of the Bruce Highway is great news. Youth unemployment is one of those perennial issues on the Sunshine Coast, and so the JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme will be fantastic news, giving young locals the start they need. And nowhere in Australia is there a higher proportion of people who own their own businesses, and so the instant asset write-offs, the loss carry-back scheme, will provide an enormous advantage in maintaining our entrepreneurial zeal. This is on top of JobKeeper, JobSeeker and JobMaker. This is indeed to rebuild our economy and to secure our future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Two weeks ago, we saw Labor's concerns come to fruition, with dnata workers losing their jobs. This is a direct result of this government's stubbornness to leave some workers behind. Back in May, the government refused to include workers who worked for a number of companies and universities in JobKeeper. That has real consequences for Australian workers and Australian families. We are now seeing those consequences play out, with a thousand dnata workers being made redundant two weeks ago. In my local area in South Australia a number of workers have now lost their jobs. This was entirely preventable. The government should have acted on Labor's warnings and unions' warnings that these workers would lose their jobs if the government did not take action. We warned of this back in May. Unfortunately, this government has failed to act and we are now seeing the consequences. My heart goes out to all those workers who no longer have jobs as a result of this government's inaction. I urge the government, as do unions, Labor and many others in the community, not to leave these workers behind. Give them the support they need, because they deserve to be on JobKeeper, just like other Australian workers in this country.</span>

We also know that in recent months 760,000 jobs that had been lost or reduced to zero hours have come back. And we know, on the measured employment, that just under 60 per cent of the jobs that have come back have been for women, and there has also been a very strong comeback for young people.</span>

Our plan is one for recovery, that gets businesses opening their doors, investing again and hiring people. The economic plan that was contained in last night's budget builds on the considerable support that has enabled Australians to weather this crisis, with the blow cushioned by the measures that have been put in place to support them. And those jobs will keep coming back, because of the measures that we put in place and that we announced last night in the budget.</span>

It has been Australia, through the great will and resilience and strength of the Australian people, supported by a government who's got their backs, that has ensured that the blow of the COVID recession around the world, something the Leader of the Opposition is oblivious toâ€”apparently COVID-19 didn't happen in Australia. It happened in every single country around the world, and somehow it didn't happen in Australia. That diminishes the great loss of Australians in this country because of COVID-19. And if the Leader of the Opposition can't work out there has been a COVID pandemic in the world, let alone Australia, then he is as clueless as the Australian people know him to be, and as inexperienced when it comes to issues of economic policy and budget management as his record demonstrates.</span>

I know the member for Lindsay will be very pleased that, as a result of her very strong advocacy as the local member, there's an extra $63.5 million, doubling our current funding, for Dunheved Road.

It's about keeping people in jobs and it's about getting people in jobs. As the Treasurer said, there is no economic recovery in this country unless there is a jobs recovery and there is no budget recovery in this country unless there is a jobs recovery. That's why last night's budget has a plan to ensure that we have jobs recovery in this country. It is a plan to recover from the COVID-19 recession and to ensure that there is a coalition-led jobs recovery in this country in the months and years ahead.</span>

It will do that while guaranteeing the essentials that Australians rely on by growing our economy, not increasing taxes and increasing the burden on Australians, who deserve to keep more of what they earn. Our government continues to keep our pledge and our promise to them that in this country they will always keep more of what they earn under a Liberal-National government.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan has been cushioning the blow and will continue to enable Australians and the businesses that employ them to weather the storm that we are going through at this very difficult time for Australians. Our budget is about recovering the lost ground, as I've already outlined, as those jobs start coming back. That is achieved by bringing forward the tax relief for hardworking Australians, particularly those on low and middle incomes; bringing forward the investment decisions of Australian businesses, with our investment allowance; bringing forward the decisions of businesses to employ more Australians through the JobMaker hiring credit; and bringing forward the infrastructure spending that the Deputy Prime Minister has been leading all around this country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget is about building for the future. The training and skills reforms are going to get 340,000 places delivered this year and 12,000 additional university places on top of the 17,000 additional places next year that the minister has already outlined.

I never thought I would see the day when the Labor Party were seeking to play politics by pitting young people against senior Australians. He asked me about the JobMaker hiring credit. It is designed to support 450,000 jobs. We have a number of programs designed to support senior Australians who have been out of work and designed to provide incentives of up to $10,000 to employers to take them on. We have those programs in place.</span>

You should not see one program in isolation from the comprehensive range of programs. The Prime Minister talked about the bringing forward of tax cuts. Of course we have got $14 billion of infrastructure spending and the loss carry-back measure that is supporting business, as well as the immediate expensing initiative that will support business investment and the productive capacity of our economy. All these measures work in tandem. The Australian economy is a complex ecosystem and our initiatives are working together to do one thing, and that is to create jobs. </span>

                  </span>And we were able to spend as was necessary through this crisis because we approached it from a position of economic strength, because we delivered the first balanced budget in 11 years, because we saw welfare dependency at a 30-year low and because, when we came to government, unemployment was at 5.7 per cent, but in February, ahead of the crisis, it was at 5.1 per cent. So the measures that we have taken over the last six and a bit years have strengthened the balance sheet of the country so that we could respond to this crisis, and that has allowed us to help save 700,000 jobs. I repeat, for the member for Rankin, that the budget last night makes it very clear that, but for the measures we have taken and announced, the unemployment rate would've reached 12 per cent and been sustained at that level this year and next year. So last night's budget was all about jobsâ€”helping those who are out of a job get into a job and helping those who are in work today stay in work. This is an economic crisis like Australia has never seen before, and our measures are designed to help those Australians in need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:16</span>):  To the Treasurer: we have no national integrity commission and the only department shining a light on outrageous misuse of public funds like the Leppington land sale is the Australian National Audit Office. With their number of performance audits already down last financial year due to insufficient funding, and now, in last night's budget, a further 12 per cent cut to funding for performance audits, how can the Australian people have confidence that your record-breaking spending doesn't lead to record-breaking pork-barrelling and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars?</span>

Our response was laid out in the budget last night, and it was all about jobsâ€”helping those Australians who are out of work get into work, and those who are in a job stay in a job.

And last night we announced the bringing forward of stage 2 of our tax cuts to ensure that more than 11Â½ million Australians will get further tax relief. So, if you're on $60,000, you will pay $2,160 less tax than you would have paid before our plan was rolled out. That means more money in your pocket. This will help create some 50,000 jobs across the economy. It was so important to bring forward stage 2, to add an additional year of the lower- and middle-income tax offset and to support more than 11Â½ million Australians. But I'm asked whether there are any alternative approaches. We know it is still on their books to have a retirees tax, to have a housing tax, to have a superannuation tax and to have a higher income tax. Only under the coalition will you see lower taxes.</span>

They're good people, in Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie. They have worked very hard through COVID. Their small businesses were looked after last night. Those in work and those not in work on the Mid North Coast will be looked after in the future. This budget is one for infrastructure. It is one for the regions. The government is making a record investment of $110 billion of infrastructure, $36 billion of which is in the regionsâ€”$110 billion extending to every single corner of this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the benefits of infrastructure investment flow beyond the project itselfâ€”into accommodation services, into cafes, into restaurants, into every small business. And we're looking after them. We're looking after workers with tax cuts. It's why we invest in transformational projects. Investment in infrastructure is an investment in small business. It's an investment in our communities. It's an investment in people. It's an investment in the here and now. It's an investment in the future. In total, the Coffs Harbour Bypass is being delivered through a $1.46 billion investment by this government, being allocated more than $490.6 million in additional funding under the budget announced last night. The project is expected to support 12,000 direct and indirect jobs in addition to the 100,000 jobs right across the nation being delivered through the $110 billion record amount of investment that we're putting into infrastructure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects are job creators. They're backed by this budget. They will deliver benefits to not just the Mid North Coast, not just the electorate of Cowper but indeed right across this nation, making sure people get to where they need to be sooner and more safely. Our regions are responsible for 40 per cent of economic output and two-thirds of our exports. And I tell you what, in the electorate of the member for Cowper they lead the way, too. They lead the way in small business. They lead the way in production, and they love doing it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we place economic recovery in the heart of our regions. Our regions have been hit hard. They've been hit by bushfires. They've been hit by drought. They've been hit by COVID. But they're coming through. They're leading the way, as you would expect. We've got $200 million for an additional roundâ€”round 5â€”of the Building Better Regions Fund. It's made such a difference, right throughout our regionsâ€”such a difference for small business, such a difference for those local councilsâ€”and $100 million is dedicated to tourism related infrastructure; I know how hard our tourism industry has been hit. We're going to get through it. The regions are going to lead the way. The Mid North Coast area that the member for Cowper represents will also lead the way.</span>

First of all, the recession that has been caused in this country has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a fact that seems lost on the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. And every time he ignores the impact of COVID-19 on the Australian economy he demonstrates his lack of understanding of the Australian economy. If you want to do this job, there are two things you particularly have to know about. You need to know about economic management, and you need to know about national securityâ€”two issues that this Leader of the Opposition has shown no interest in, in his more than 20 years in this place.</span>

It may come as some surprise to the Leader of the Opposition, but women run small businesses. Women pay tax. Women hire other Australians in their businesses. Women want to drive on safe roads. Women want to go to university, and they want to study science and technology and engineering and maths, like the minister for industry did, becoming an accomplished engineer before she came into this place. They want to get apprenticeships. They want to get traineeships. They want to get jobs. And 60 per cent of the jobs that have come back in measured employment since the pit of the COVID-19 recession have gone to women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on the road to trying to restore the record participation of women that we were able to put in place before the COVID-19 recession hit and the gender pay gap was reduced to its lowest level. And those jobs are coming back for women. But, not content with that, we had in this year's budget the Women's Economic Security Statement. That statement is $240 million of specific initiatives to support women in their businesses, their entrepreneurship, their training and their mentoring support and to increase their participation in the labour force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just that. In this budget we have listed Lynparza, the ovarian cancer drug. And I can tell you why we have been able to list so many drugs that support women in this country. It is because we've provisioned for it, we've budgeted for it and we've run an economy that can pay for it. When those opposite were in government, they cut funding to the PPS and they didn't list drugs. The Australian people saw that at the last election, and that's one of the many reasons they decided not to put those opposite on the Treasury benches. We back women, because we're getting women in jobs.</span>

I know that she, like many of the members on this side of the House, has owned and operated a business herself and that she, like we do, understands how challenging it can be to run a small business. It's very clear that the last six months have been particularly challenging for our small businesses, and that's why we as a government acted very quickly to support our small businesses, because they are the engine room of our economy and they are the job creators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now are focusing on recovery and the future, and last night's budget was designed to turbocharge our small businesses, with their investment and also with their growth. When our businesses thrive, they create jobs. They create opportunities for all Australians. Once again, we're backing business investment in this budget, with $31.6 billion in business tax relief. This includes a massive extension of the very successful instant asset tax write-off, with 99 per cent of businesses being able to write-off an asset of any value. This means that small businessesâ€”and that includes our cafe owners, our tradies, our builders and our manufacturersâ€”are going to be able to boost their productivity by looking at new equipment and new technology as part of this, for example, new vehicles. Members on all sides of the House know how important the instant asset tax write-off has been to support the businesses in their electorates, so it does promote opportunities for businesses to grow, for businesses to expand, and that's how they create jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are many other things in this budget that support our small businesses. We're providing incentives, with the JobMaker Hiring Credit, for businesses to take on new employees and to give our young people a start. We're helping our small businesses access the benefits of digital technology, to expand opportunities and to keep them safe online. We're investing in skills training so our small businesses have the pipeline of skilled works that they need so that they can create the jobs that are needed now but also the jobs of the future. We're strategically investing in our manufacturing sector because, as we scale up our medium and our large enterprises, they will bring with them the small businesses behind them.</span>

That's what this budget does. It is a plan for small business. It's a plan for investment. It's a plan for jobs.

I refer her to the answer that I just gave, because, under this government, we have seen 60 per cent of the jobs that have come back since the pit of the COVID-19 recession go to women. What we've seen is this government's investment in women getting jobs, because we're investing in an economy that can create jobs. Women will be seeking jobs in manufacturing industries. They'll be seeking jobs in the agricultural industry. They'll be seeking jobs right across the economy. But this budget, above all, is a budget for all Australians, who are dealing with the challenge of the biggest global recession that we have seen since the Second World War.</span>

All Australian families sitting around the table at home will have woken up this morning with an even greater sense of confidence, knowing that this government has their backâ€”including women, because women are an increasing part of our labour force, and they will continue to grow in our labour force because of the skills and the attainment that they're able to achieve. Under this government the gender pay gap got to its lowest level and under this government the labour force participation of women got to its highest level, and that is what we will continue to pursue through the many policies that are outlined in this budget. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  I thank the member for Higgins for her question and her outstanding leadership in so many women's groups, causes and initiatives, not just in Melbourne but across the nation and the world. I was talking to the member for Higgins this morning about her involvement with Global Sisters and with Tradeswomen Australia, and about how she reaches out to working women in her electorate and asks them what they would like to see, and responds. She is so connected. Indeed, every woman member on the government side is absolutely across the need, coming out of COVID, for a plan out of the budget that provides jobs for women. Our plan for jobs in yesterday's budget is, indeed, a plan for womenâ€”for their participation in the workforce, for their ongoing opportunity and for their financial security. Women's success is intrinsic to our economic success and the success of the nation, and we completely understand that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, central to all of the measures that we're undertaking to support women and their families and their communities and whatever stage of life they are at is the Women's Economic Security Statement, first introduced by the member for Higgins's predecessor, Kelly O'Dwyer, in 2018 and updated by Minister Payne, senator in the other placeâ€”and a huge recognition for her contribution. The updated statement and its associated measures build on what we've already done. Priority areas include repairing and rebuilding women's workforce participation, greater choice and flexibility for families to manage work and care, supporting women as leaders and positive role models, and supporting women to be safe at home. That's the Women's Economic Security Statement. There's $50 million over four years through Women@Work, expanding our leadership and development program. We can continue to partner with industry, such as Master Builders and their Women Building Australia programâ€”that's going to be so importantâ€”that recruits, retains and supports women entering the construction industry, which is so important right now. It supports women like Melanie and Emma Fasham in Victoria, sisters who run their family construction budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Higgins mentioned an extraordinary young woman called Grace Halifax, who she helped on a Zoom call to teach her fellow students Zoom. Grace is eight years old. She'll be an ideal candidate for our Boosting Female Founders Initiative, which will support up to 4,300 women entrepreneurs, and $24 million to support women in study and to complete STEM qualifications. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is record spending in this budget on health, on NDIS, on aged care, on listing new drugs for ovarian cancer and of course on our continuation of JobKeeper, which helps so many women in small business, whether they're employees or employers. JobKeeper will help us tackle the tough times ahead. As we come out of COVID, we're helping grow small business. We're helping women gain better jobs. We're helping women stayâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is a record $9.2 billion worth of funding for the childcare sector. And, importantlyâ€”and this seems to have been completely overlookedâ€”there was $900 million of additional funding for the childcare sector to support them through the pandemic. Do you know what that led to? It led to 99 per cent of all childcare providers remaining viable throughout the pandemic, providing services to those on the front line during the pandemicâ€”those nurses, those doctors. In particularâ€”and I say this on behalf of all members here in the House because I'm sure this is one thing we will all agree onâ€”I thank those members who were on the front line when it came to providing those important services of keeping those childcare service providers open. A majority of women were servicing those childcare providers and educators.</span>

                  </a>  We backed them with $900 million of additional funding. What has that meant? Those opposite often say, 'Okay, what did this lead to?' What have our reforms led to? CPI data shows that, on average, our changes across the country have delivered real savings to families by reducing out-of-pocket costs by 3.2 per cent from July 2018 to March 2020. We've seen out-of-pocket costs go down under our childcare reforms, and we will continue to provide the support that the sector needs. There will be $900 million of additional funding to help them through the pandemic, and there will be a record $9.2 billion in this budget to support the childcare sector throughout this year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  I want to thank the member for Berowra. Along with all members in this House, he has a deep interest in mental health and suicide prevention, but he is one of the leaders in this place, with his focus on such a profoundly important topic. In any one year we know that four million Australians will face some form of mental health challenge. But this year, above all years, the challenges have been even greater: flood, fire, drought and, of course, the catastrophic human toll of the pandemic. There has been the health toll, the lockdown impacts and the anxiety related to economic circumstances and employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, throughout the course of the pandemic, we've worked together with the states and territories, the opposition and all others to invest in this space to provide support and to provide confidence. Already over $500 million has been provided throughout the course of this year with regard to mental health, with telehealth being a fundamental component of that. It is now at over 33 million services, and mental health remains a huge part of that. This budget lays down the systemic reform pathway to make telehealth a permanent and abiding legacy for the better of the pandemic. That's positive for mental health; it's positive for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as that, though, the budget very specifically lays down a framework for mental health for the coming four years. In this year alone, there will be $5.7 billion of investment in mental health and suicide prevention support for Australians, and that includes an additional $485 million of mental health funding right now, this year. Very specifically, as part of that, there is the addition to and the doubling of the Better Access psychological support servicesâ€”from 10 to 20 services. That will provide relief and support for many Australians. It's an important step forward that will give them hope, give them confidence and give them mental health support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, $64 million is being provided for the vital work of suicide prevention. That suicide prevention funding comes on top of the $740 million which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer very passionately allocated last year. That includes $26 million for headspace, $13 million to extend the National Suicide Prevention Trial program and $7 million for Beyond Blue's vitally important The Way Back Support Service. The Way Back program is about giving people hope after they have attempted suicide, have recovered and have been discharged from hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the budget as a whole is about hope and recovery, but the budget for mental health in particular is about hope, recovery and support.</span>

Over the past three years, 30,000 Australians have died while waiting for approved home-care packages to be delivered. There are 102,000 Australians on the home care waiting list. How on earth can the government rack up $1 trillion of Liberal debt but only announce an average of 6,000 home-care places a year over the next four years?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank the member for Cooper for her question because it gives me an opportunity, as the Treasurer said last night, to remind the House that when we came to government there were 60,000 in-home aged-care places. As a result of the single largest increase in in-home aged-care places last night, that figure is now over 180,000. Over the course of our government we have tripled the number of in-home aged-care places in this country, and 97 per cent of those who are seeking aged-care places in their home are already either receiving an in-home aged-care place or some other form of in-home support. As the Treasurer made very clear last night, we're awaiting the recommendations of the royal commission into the aged-care sector, where we have been very clear that we will be making a comprehensive response to those recommendations and that will be done most likely in the course of next year's budget, if not sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we can say, though, is that we have delivered $1.5 billion of additional support into the aged-care sector through the course of this pandemic. On top of that, in response to the interim report of the royal commission, which called for more aged-care places and for a number of other actions, we responded to all of those last year. Here in this budget we said we would respond again, and we have. We have tripled the number of in-home aged-care places in this country, with an additional 23,000 last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite don't seem to understand that, in aged care, you could fund but you have to be able to ensure that those places can be delivered by the sector itself. We understand that and we need to ensure that proper care is paid to those who are receiving those in-home aged-care places. We're not going to go down the reckless path that those opposite pursued when they were in government, throwing money around with no thought to the consequences of how they implement it. That was the record of those opposite, who speak today about putting a roof over people's heads. Well, the last time the Labor Party put money into people's roofs they set them alight!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were talking about child care earlier. I wanted to share with the House a couple of quotes from the childcare sector themselves about our record funding of $9.2 billion and our $900 million of additional funding that we provided the sector to get them through the pandemic. This is from Elizabeth Death, the Early Learning and Care Council of Australia CEO:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We applaud the Government's commitment to ensuring that early learning and care services could survive the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government's financial support for sector viability was absolutely critical and valued.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We commend the government for recognising the unique circumstances facing Victorian early learning services and for continuing the extensive support offered to our vital sector since the beginning of the pandemic. This Recovery Payment, coupled with the extension of the Activity Test exemption, ensures financial viability for Victorian service providers during a period of economic uncertainty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's $9.2 billion of record funding for the childcare sector, including $900 million of new money.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to schools our budget commits us to $314.7 billion of record funding between 2018 and 2029. That includes $146.3 million to deliver a range of projects to help support students, families and school communities impacted by COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also record funding for universities, funding that's growing from $18 billion to $20 billion. Under our plan for higher education there will be 100,000 new places by 2030. Importantly, in the budget, there's record investment for research in this country. We want research to drive the innovation and the new industries to come out of this pandemic. We want the university sector, through its research, to be one of the drivers of our economic recovery, and that's why we're providing $1 billion of new money for research in this country in this budget. I thank the higher education sector for the cooperative way they've worked with the government to ensure that we can make this investment and ensure that they are a key part of driving us through our economic recovery. There is record funding for child care, for schools, for higher education and for research in this budget.</span>

Yes, there was a fund created, and part of that fund was to provide funding in two tranches: one through $150 million to be able to be spent on rebuilding infrastructure. That hasn't been used because we have created a $2 billion fund in which to rebuild the infrastructure that was devastated by these fires, and that was predicated on advice of the Director-General of Emergency Management Australia. They didn't believe that it was worth doing that because we had created this other mechanism in which to do that. To give a perfect example, the electorate of Gilmore itself received nearly $139 million in direct relief. With respect to the $50 million that is there for resilience building, the Director-General of Emergency Management Australia is taking submissions and, in fact, is about to provide me with some of those programs. In fact, I had a conversation with the member for Eden-Monaro only last week about putting forward projects that her community may benefit from.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is above politics. This is about people, and the people's lives that are impacted. We need to make sure that we understand the trauma that these people went through and that they are at different stages of recovery. We need to allow them and their communities to decide what that recovery looks like, what resilience looks like, into the future. To rush that isn't about making sure that it's a locally led recovery.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>This means that it will be a Canberra led recovery. We'll continue to engage with communities, with members from both sides of the aisle, in a constructive way in rebuilding the lives and livelihoods of Australians that were destroyed through this bushfire season. We'll do that in a calm, methodical way using Australian taxpayers' money in the most effective way.</span>

He does a fantastic job on that committee and provides an opportunity for usâ€”particularly the agencies in my portfolio, such as ASIO and othersâ€”to work very closely with the committee, and for that I'm very grateful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the dividends of managing the budget well and making sure that we've taken decisions in recent years to put our country in a strong position financially is that we can deliver strong essential services. That's a big dividend out of this budget. We've been able to respond to the health pandemic. We've been able to provide support to our hospitals and to many other aspects of the response to COVID-19, but, importantly, this budget is all about providing the essential services that Australians require. In particular one of the highest priorities of this government is to make sure that we can keep Australians safe. The threat of terrorism hasn't gone away. We know the scourge of people smugglers hasn't diminished. We know that we have to make sure that our armed services are provided with all the support that is possible. So last night we provided additional funding of about $1.7 billion to implement the Cyber Security Strategy which will help keep Australians safe online. In particular, we are providing support to mums and dads who are worried about their kids online and older Australians who might be worried about identity theft. I'm also very proud that in the budget last night we were able to provide certainty to the Australian Federal Police and increase their funding. It means that they can provide more frontline services not just in the cyberspace but in many other areas, including child protection where they do amazing work each day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the dividends of managing the economy wellâ€”and that has been the focus of the government over a long period of time, as I've pointed outâ€”is to make sure that we can invest in the Australian Defence Force. All of us are incredibly proud of the work that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force have done domestically during the recent natural disasters and in the response to the pandemic, but they are working around the world today to keep Australians safe and to serve our interests abroad. That's why we are investing more than $270 billion in Australia's defence capability over the next decade. It is the biggest investment in defence in decades, and it brings this government's investment in defence up to two per cent of GDP. If we look at Labor's atrocious approach, they dropped defence budgets down to levels that hadn't been seen since before the Second World War. We have invested in essential services, and we will continue to keep Australians safe.</span>

                  </a>  When we came to government in 2013 and inherited a train wreck of a project, we chose the multitechnology mix because it would allow the NBN to be rolled out more quickly. I want to make three very important points about the strategy we followed. First, the multitechnology mix was quicker. It let us get to the point where, by 2020, 11.8 million premises are able to connectâ€”99 per cent of premises are able to connect. And just imagine the mess Australia would have been in when millions of Australians overnight moved to studying and working from home, if we had still been going on the slow broadband plan we inherited from the other side. The second point is that the multitechnology mix was considerably cheaper. It saved $30 billion. The third pointâ€”and this is really importantâ€”is that, when we decided on the multitechnology mix, we said that, when demand reached the appropriate point, we would then upgrade the network when the demand conditions justified it. </span>

But that's what we've done. That's what we've done, and that's why we now have 11.8 million premises able to connect and why we are now able to take the next stage in the development of the NBN, where eight million premises are going to be in a position to order a speed of up to one gigabit per second; and, indeed, 240 business fibre zones around the country, including 85 in regional Australia, where some 700,000 businesses will be able to order a business-grade optical fibre one-gigabit symmetrical service, and they'll be able to do it at the same priceâ€”NBN will charge the same priceâ€”as in our CBD areas. </span>

We've got 99 per cent of premises able to connect and we can now move to the logical next step, and that is what exactly what we are doing, consistent with the plan we've followed for seven years. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Nicholls for his question because he, better than anyone, knows the importance of exports in the agricultural sector, particularly in his seat of Nicholls. It has a very rich and proud history of it. Overall, exports through Australian agriculture are so imperative. We are simply a nation of 25 million people; we produce enough food for 75 million people. So, if we don't engage with the world, if we don't trade with the world, then we don't need the number of farmers we've got now and we don't need the communities that are there to support them, like the Sheppartons of the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 270,000 Australians who are employed in the farming sector. Three in five of those jobs are tied to international exports. That's why this government has been proud to secure free trade agreements with China, Japan, Korea, the TPP-11, Hong Kong and, only in the last couple of months, Indonesia. And now we're working with the EU and the UK to secure more trade agreements. Before that, we made significant investments in agricultural counsellors. We've taken them from 16 to 22 positions. These counsellors sit in embassies and high commissions around the world, and they work at a government-to-government level in breaking down non-tariff barriers and getting rid of red tape, and making market access even greater and simpler for our farmers, saving our farmers money and putting more money back into their pockets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not just looking at those international governments and how we can remove barriers; we're looking at ourselves. Last night we made a significant investment, over $230 million, in streamlining our export platform to make it fit for the future and make it single touch. If you are a citrus grower wanting to export at the moment, you'll fill out 20 application forms to export your product around the world. This investment will bring it down to one. This is an investment in those communities, in making sure that we get out of their lives as quickly as we can and get them into international markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've gone further. We're working with complementary measures with all the industries, whether they be meat, fish, horticulture or even grains, in looking at how quality assurance is done. I'm proud to say the red meat sector has led the way on this. We're looking to invest in technologies even for them. They're now transitioning to smart glasses, manufactured in Brisbane, that allow audits to take place externally. This is saving man hours and money. When we are able to undertake these types of initiatives in a constructive way with industries, starting at red meat and working through, consulting with those industries, we're going to save that industry alone $40 million a year. That'll go back into the process and the farm gate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we implement all of these changes, in the next 10 years, it will potentially be over $1 billion that will go back through the processing sector to the farm gate. If we make these investments and the money goes back into those businesses' pockets, they are the ones that will be out there employing and creating the new jobs, particularly in regional Australia. This is a smart investment in regional Australia and in agriculture, helping reach its $100 billion goal by 2030.</span>

The question is asking about our ability to deliver on our commitments in response to the COVID crisis. I would like to inform the honourable member that total government support and payments already being made in response to the COVID crisis is $112.4 billion. In terms of JobKeeper there's $60.4 billion; in terms of the cash-flow boost there's $28.6 billion; in terms of the two economic support paymentsâ€”the $750 paymentsâ€”the first was $5.5 billion and the second was $3.8 billion; in terms of the coronavirus supplement there's $14.1 billion; and in terms of the pandemic leave disaster payment there's $14.7 million. That was even before we gave people access to their own money with early access to superannuation. In the first early release $20.1 billion of payments were made, and in the second so far it's $15.6 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are measures that have been designed to strengthen and boost the Australian economy. Those on this side of the House, and indeed the Australian community, know that the Morrison government stands with small business, understanding that they are the backbone of the economy. We have cut taxes for small business. Last night we announced a number of measures, including the immediate expensing, the loss carry-back measure, which is designed to boost small business. As the minister for infrastructure is well aware, when you have a major project it supports small businesses right across the country. Only this side of the House stands every day with small business.</span>

                  </a>  I notice the member for McMahon mocking it. Yes, he did mock it when we announced the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. He mocked it originally. Since then, we've delivered on the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which allows Australians to get into their first home with a deposit of as little as five per cent. Everybody in this House should know that the biggest challenge for first home buyers is getting that deposit togetherâ€”a deposit where banks are requiring increasingly at least a 20 per cent deposit. For the average home in Sydney, it's taking up to 10 years to save that deposit; and, in Melbourne, up to eight years. The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme is halving that time, and last night we announced an additional 10,000 places for this financial year, with one additional caveatâ€”that is, that it is for the purchase of a new home because, in addition to supporting first home buyers, we want to continue to support the residential construction industry. An additional 10,000 homes will, therefore, be purchased this year, supporting those workers and also helping those people into a new home. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes on top of another very successful Morrison government initiative, the HomeBuilder scheme. The HomeBuilder scheme has seen builders around the country very publicly saying they've got a good problem that they're dealing with, and that is that they're struggling with the amount of work that is now coming in the doorâ€”struggling. I think that's a very good problem to have in this environment. In fact, AKD Softwoods, a timber mill in Colac that stood down 51 workers in May because it was concerned about the residential construction industry, last week reopened, put all those 51 workers back on and increased its workforce by 25 people. AKD said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  The budget that was handed down last night from that dispatch box was somehow, miraculously, less than the sum of its parts. This was the biggest missed opportunity in a Commonwealth budget since Federation. This was the budget where Australian politics' butter-fingers was thrown the ball and he dropped it. The whole nation was ready for a vision for the future, a vision for jobs, a plan to get us through this recession and into recovery, and a plan to kickstart that recovery and kickstart the economy so that we can start growing again, the right way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But never before has a budget spent so much to achieve so little. When you comb through what was announced last night, when you get beyond all of the spin, all of the self-congratulation, all of the awkwardly posed photographs and all of the headlines, what are Australians actually left with at the end, from this budget that was announced less than 24 hours ago? They are left with two things. They are left with $1.7 trillion of debt and they are left with unemployment which is unacceptably high for, unacceptably, too long. They have nothing to show for $100 billion of new spending and $1.7 trillion of debt, nothing except unemployment, which has been too high for too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing, which we on this side of the House understand but those opposite don't seem to understand, is that you don't judge a budget by the headlines it generates; you judge a budget by the jobs and opportunities that it generates and how it shares those opportunities fairly into every single corner of our country. If you sit down and think about what they announced last night and what was proposedâ€”in the near term it might have passed the headlines test, but it hasn't passed the budget test. You judge a budget by jobs and opportunities and what it says about the future, and you judge a government by its ability to understand what's happening to real people in the real communities that we represent, right around Australiaâ€”to have enough understanding, empathy and appreciation of the difficulty that people are going through and to actually stand up and say that you will do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite a remarkable feat that those opposite have managed to rack up more than $1 trillion in debt and yet we expect another 160,000 of our fellow Australians to lose their jobs between now and the end of the year. Remarkably, after all of that spending and all of that spraying money around, they still forecast the unemployment rate to be higher at the end of the four-year forward estimates than it was before any of us had even heard of the coronavirus. It's remarkable that they've sprayed around all that money and racked up more than $1 trillion in debt and they've still managed to leave so many Australians behind. I'll give you one example: 928,000 Australian workers currently on unemployment benefits aren't even eligible for the main policy in the budget, which was the hiring subsidy. They've left 928,000 Australians in the lurch when it comes to that hiring subsidy. They've racked up $1 trillion in debt and they've still found a way, miraculously, to do nothing about social housing, child care, residential aged care, cleaner and cheaper energy and local jobs programsâ€”nothing. It takes a fair bit of effort to rack up more than $1 trillion in debt and still leave all of those crucial policy areas out in the cold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've wracked up $1 trillion in debt and still haven't managed to undo the damage done by seven years of incompetence and mismanagement and cuts to vital areas like training but also right across the board. All of that damage, and they want to pretend that those seven years of mismanagement can somehow, miraculously, be explained by the last seven months or so of COVID-19. They've wracked up $1 trillion in debt and still have no plan or vision for the future. There's not even a skerrick of vision in this budget. It's all short-term stuff about getting them through an election and getting them the front page of the paper, but there's nothing which resembles a vision for the future of this country. Most importantly, there's nothing about where real people fit in that vision and what people can expect when it comes to how we spread opportunity in this country, how we give people access to the opportunities that come from a recovering economy. There's nothing at all about that, and it's because they don't understand the impacts of this Morrison recession, the first recession in three decades, the deepest and most damaging recession in almost a century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have absolutely no idea what it means for people. They don't know what people are going through. Almost a million are already unemployed, with another 160,000 to come. Unemployment has been too high for too long. People have been left out and left behind. People are worried. Over-35s are worried about not being able to access this hiring subsidy. Maybe they've just copped the JobKeeper cut, with $300 less a fortnight. If they lose their job then they're back to $40 a day, if we take what we saw in the budget last night as the government's plan. That's a pretty bleak future that those opposite have painted for millions of Australians who want nothing more than the chance and the ability to put food on their family's table, to put school shoes on their kids' feet and to pay the rent or the mortgageâ€”not just to get by but to get ahead. These are not unreasonable things that the people that we represent want for themselves and for the people that they love.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget fails the future test. It leaves people behind, leaves key policies out and leaves unemployment too high for too long. It forgets to paint a vision for the future. It also did something else really important. It torpedoed for all time, forever, the stupendous dishonesty and the stupendous hypocrisy of almost everything that those opposite have said about debt and deficit over the last dozen or so years. Look at those opposite and think about what they've been saying now for the last 10 or 12 years about debt and deficit. All of that has been completely blown up by the fact that they have now racked up $1.7 trillion in debt, which is more than six times what they inherited when the government changed hands in 2013.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard enough from those oppositeâ€”all this rubbish, hypocrisy and dishonesty about what happened during the GFC, what happened in the interim and what's happening now. I don't know how the Treasurer looks at himself in the mirror in the morning, having said all of these things for a decade or more. Forever he will be associated with $1.7 trillion in debt and the deepest and most damaging recession in almost a century.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These same characters have been going around the country for more than a decade now trying to diminish what Australians achieved together in the period under Prime Minister Rudd, Treasurer Swan and the cabinet that contained the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Sydney and others. We say to those opposite: 'Enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the dishonesty and enough of the rubbish about debt and deficit. It's time for you to recognise that much of what you've said over the last decade or so has been completely and utterly wrong.'</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last night's budget there are all the missed opportunitiesâ€”and the Australian people were expecting more, frankly, during this recession from the governmentâ€”all of the disappointments, all of the things left out, all the people left behind and all of the unemployment, which has been too high for too long. I think it's really important to remember that before we came into this crisisâ€”and those opposite talk about coming into it from a position of strengthâ€”this Prime Minister, the chicken whisperer, and the Treasurer had never in their entire time in their current roles presided over anything near trend growth in the economy. Neverâ€”not onceâ€”has the Prime Minister or the Treasurer in their current roles gone anywhere near it or a surplus. They doubled the debt. We entered this period from a position of weakness, not strength. That left us vulnerable. It did so in the health area as well. That's why we need a centre for disease control. In the economy in particular all of the mismanagement for seven years has left us exposed and that's why the recession we're in right now is deeper and more damaging than it needs to be and that is why the unemployment queues are longer than they need to be.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't recover from this recession the right way unless those opposite recognise that the whole point of a budget is not to attract headlines but to chase jobs. It's about painting a vision for the future and telling people where they fit in that. Australians were prepared to give the government a chance last night. They tuned in to hear what was in it for them. Unfortunately, it was a massive missed opportunity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  There are few people less qualified to critique a budget than the member for Rankin. Every single speech the member for Rankin makes at the dispatch box comes back to one thingâ€”how good the Rudd and Gillard governments were. Every single speech has that conclusion at the bottom. We were so harshly treated. Australians made a big mistake with the glory days of the Rudd and Gillard governments. This shadow Treasurer has absolutely zero credibility when it comes to speaking about budgets, much less critiquing last night's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not just last night but throughout the extraordinary year of 2020 Australians have seen a government that has cushioned the blow. It's a huge blow. We've levelled with the Australian people and said: 'We can't eliminate the blow, wish it away or in some way imagine it's not there, but we can cushion the blow,' and that's what we have done. Last night the Treasurer, in an outstanding fashion, outlined to Australia the plan to get Australians back to work, the plan to get confidence back into the most important part of the economy that employs eight out of 10 Australiansâ€”the private sector. The private sector is the part of the economy that has been completely and utterly devastated by the consequences of the pandemic. Last night, what we saw was a plan to ensure that confidence could return, that Australian businesses could again have the confidence that they need to, in some cases, restart their businesses, to grow their businesses, to invest in their businesses and, most importantly, to employ their fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the party of jobs. When we came to government, unemployment was at 5.7 per cent. Just before the pandemic hit in earnest, in February, it was 5.1 per cent. We had the lowest welfare dependency in 30 years. What we outlined to Australians last night was a way to get back. Indeed, in the future, we hope to exceed those expectations that Australians have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are today somehow trying to mock the budget and mock the spending initiatives and, indeed, mock the budget bottom line, which has been massively hit by the fact that our economy will be significantly smaller, over the medium term certainly, as a result of the pandemic. Implied in that is that somehow the spending initiatives that the government have put in place, again to ensure that we cushion the blow for Australians, are somehow illegitimate. On the one hand the Labor Party say JobKeeper is too generous to some employees; on the other hand they say it's not generous enough to other employees. Again, they're having a bet each way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, we outlined for Australians a plan to encourage investment in the first instance. Now, the announcement of instant expensing for depreciable assets for businesses with a turnover up to $5 billionâ€”essentially every Australian business bar the largest 40 or 50 Australian businessesâ€”is going to fill the order books of this country. As the Treasurer said in his speech last night, whether it's the trucking company investing in a new fleet, the food production business investing in new plant and equipment or the small cafe investing in a new coffee machine, this will drive investment throughout the economy. Indeed, the feedback we have had, the feedback I had directly from industry overnight, is that it will do exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly for our economy, giving businesses the incentives, through the tax system, to make those investments improves your productivity, which sees a huge dividend for the economy in the medium to long term. So, yes, this is about jobs today. This is about ensuring that we get as many Australians as possible back into work, get as many Australians as possible doing the hours that they want to do in the short term, but it's also about the productivity benefits into the medium and longer term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also announced loss carryback last night, a very generous scheme that will allow for losses for two income years to be offset against taxes paid in the 2018-19 years or later. Now, anybody who understands the tax system will know that, yes, tax losses, in some instances, can be of benefit to a business in the futureâ€”(a) the business has got to survive that period that it's making a loss; (b) it has then got to make a gain into the future that it can offset its loss againstâ€”but the decision that the government has taken very deliberately is the benefits of those losses are needed in those businesses today. That's why we have provided a very generous loss carryback provision, which I introduced into the parliament this morning. That will mean money in the hands of businesses now. That will also mean, coupled with the instant expensing of depreciable assets uncapped, that more and more businesses will be able to use that cash flow again in a virtuous circle to reinvest into their business, to grow their business, to improve the productivity in their business and, of course, to employ their fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that I must say is quite remarkable is the criticisms from the opposition on the hiring credit and the very deliberate strategy we have taken to skew that hiring credit to younger Australians. We all know that in difficult economic times it's younger Australiansâ€”those people who have less experience in the workforceâ€”who disproportionately feel the impact. We don't need to argue about that. Surely we all agree on that. So the idea that providing a hiring credit, as this government is doing, for those who have been on JobSeeker of $200 a week for those under 30 and $100 a week for those over 30 to encourage employers to take a punt on somebody and to encourage employers to bring them into the business is somehow illegitimate is a shock to me. I'm hopeful that it's just the Labor Party all at sea today, not knowing what to say about the budget when and they have to say something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely hope they don't continue down that path, because we don't want 16- to 29-year-olds, particularly the people at the younger end of that cohort, to be the lost generation, as so many people were during Labor's 'recession that we had to have'. I still know many people, including family members, who were scarred by that, particularly those who left school at the time. We are determined to make sure that does not happen here. So we are very proud of the fact that our hiring credit is directed towards younger Australians, and we do not resile from that in any way, shape or form. Another area where we certainly differâ€”and massively differâ€”from the member for Rankin, whom nobody takes seriously when talking about budget matters, is bringing forward our personal income tax cuts for 11 million Australians. Within a matter of weeks many millions of Australians will start seeing increases in their pay packets as a result of those tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians saw very clearly at the last election the DNA of the parties. Our DNA is for lower taxes so that Australians can spend their money better and more effectively and have a better result in the economy than under the Labor Party, who wanted to whack on $387 billion of higher taxes. The Leader of the Opposition is running away from any questions about whether he stands by those taxes. Well, last night was a demonstration that we have faith that the Australian people can spend their money better than any government, and in fact now is the time when they need it. And there will be benefits to the broader economy because of it. Increasing demand in the economy and increasing consumption is going to support and work in concert with the other measures we put in place to support small, medium and large businesses in this economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in question time, we have made another investment in supporting Australians into their first home through expanding the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. If there's one thing that I want the Morrison government to be remembered for it is that we have facilitated more Australians into new homes than any government in recent history, and last night was another step along that path. So nobody listens to the member for Rankin, trying to review history in this way. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  What an extraordinary week in Australian politics. The party that has campaigned for 13 years against debt and deficit has delivered the biggest deficit and the most astronomical debt in our nation's historyâ€”not by a little bit, but by a lot. You'd expect that if you were going to rack up a trillion dollars in debt you'd be able to deliver a little bit of vision for the nation. What we saw yesterday was a trillion dollars worth of debt but not 10c worth of vision for the country. Unemployment is going up. Between now and Christmas, an additional 160,000 Australians are going to find themselves in the unemployment queue. You'd expect, if that were going to happen, the government would be doing something to help support them, but at the very time that unemployment is going to reach its highest point in over a decade, they're cutting support for the unemployed, and snapping back to $40 a day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chronic neglect in our aged-care system laid bare by the royal commission remains. The cost of child care, which is perhaps the biggest barrier to improving the participation rate and getting women back into the workforce, remains. And older workers are left more vulnerable because of a poorly designed wage incentive scheme. I heard the Assistant Treasurer say a moment ago that somehow our criticism of this point means that we're against younger workers. They have missed the point completely. What they have done is pit one group of workers against another. The job of a government with a vision for the country is to unite the people and bring the country together. What they have done is pit one group of workers against another, and they can't even see it. There's been lots of money spent and lots of debt racked up, but there is no vision for the future and no path forward. You'd think a government that racked up a trillion dollars worth of debt could do something about our roads and our infrastructure in this country. There is a trillion dollars worth of debt but, if you look at the state of New South Wales alone, not one cent has been spent on roads south of the Engadine McDonald's. It's a travesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the manufacturing industry. I come from a region with a proud history in manufacturing. We were led to believe before the budget that there was going to be some big announcement and a great step forward for Australian manufacturing. Little did we know that this was just going to be another one of the Prime Minister's marketing opportunities. Sure, he knows where the Port Kembla Steelworks are. He went down there for a photo-op and made an announcement that had nothing to do with the Port Kembla Steelworks and had everything to do with a town 200 kilometres to the north. This guy is a marketing genius but has absolutely nothing to deliver when it comes to substance.</span>

And here's another figure for you: 950,000. That's how many jobs will be created over the next four years thanks to this budget. This government will deliver 950,000 new jobs, thanks to the measures in last night's budget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pretty appalled by the member for Rankin's contribution earlier on. It a very passionless and pedestrian display. I don't think he believed it himself. It was almost laughable when he tried to take us on that trip down memory lane to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, the glory days, the salad days of Labor. Really? You don't have to go very far down that lane to realise what it was. It was the boulevard of broken dreamsâ€”pink batts; overpriced school halls; all of that mismanagement and chaos. Before that we had the recession that we had to have, and there are some of us in this place who still remember it. We still remember how bad it was when families were sitting around their dining room tables and their kitchen tables talking about how they were going to pay their 17 per cent mortgage rates. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to go down memory lane, let's go there, and we'll let Australians know how bad it was. The reality is that Australians have always trusted this side of politics to get them through the economic difficulties, the economic tough times. That's the way it's always been in this country, and last night's budget makes it certain. Australians, again, can put their faith in the Liberal-National government to deliver them through the economic storm, to get them through to the other side, with great new policies, including the JobMaker hiring credit. I think that's something that's really going to resonate right around country Australia, in particular, because at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we saw the queues that were starting to form around Centrelink. So many of them were the young people. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that often it's the younger generations that come out of a recession the slowest. Youth unemployment rates are generally higher, particularly in certain areas around our great country. So they need our support, and we're giving it to them. We're not only giving the folks on JobSeeker, our young people on JobSeeker, support but it's those apprentices as well through our Apprentice Wage Subsidy scheme. That's going to be a real boon for country Australia, getting tradies into workâ€”not only getting people into work but training the future workforce of tomorrow, which is so vital for country Australia and so vital for building strong and vibrant regions. That's what this budget delivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the JobMaker hiring credit alone you're talking around 450,000 jobs for young people, and the policies that bring us those jobs just keep on coming. Look at the tax relief for workers: 50,000 new jobs it is estimated that policy will deliver. Hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next few years will be delivered by this budget. Yes, it has been a very difficult time for regional Australiaâ€”you would know that better than anyone, Deputy Speaker O'Brienâ€”but, through this suite of policies, our regions are uniquely placed to lead our nation out of COVID-19. Have a look at the instant asset write-off. Over 99 per centâ€”</span>

                  </a>  They're probably talking about how bad it was during those Keating and Hawke years with the 17 per cent mortgage rates. They know how bad it was. Back to the instant asset write-off. The member for Fisher remembers! The instant asset write-off is really going to turbocharge investment right across Australia, particularly in country Australia where it's been very warmly received. My office has already had some very encouraging messages. I've had people texting me saying, 'That is a game changer for country Australia!' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The manufacturing policy, targeting areas such as food processing, is so important in central western New South Wales and great cities like Bathurst and the Cabonne area. It is the food basket of this nation. There'll be a huge turbocharging of infrastructure. There'll be a further $14 billion in new and accelerated infrastructure projects, which will support a further 40,000 jobs, including the famed crossing at Dixons Long Pointâ€”$9.8 million. They've been trying to get that up for 160 years. Australians know who to trust with the economy, and they can place their trust in us and be assured that we'll get them through. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  The budget that was delivered last night has left so many people behind. When you have a look at the Aboriginal affairs part of the budgetâ€”or the lack of itâ€”there is nothing for additional remote Indigenous housing. There is nothing for services to close the gap and no additional money for closing the gap, except some money to go for administration and some money to go towards a dashboard going to the Productivity Commission. That will not help Aboriginal people at the grassroots, community level. There is very little in there for women and nothing for DV, domestic violence, in a real sense. Not one additional bed has been delivered in this budget. And, of course, the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most egregious thing is what has been done in the JobSeeker area. Nine hundred thousand people on JobSeeker have been left behind. If you're over the age of 35, which the bulk of people on JobSeeker are, you simply do not get a look in. This is an incredibly short-sighted way that the government has handled this. People on JobSeeker have received no security, no comfort at all, from this budget. They still don't know what's going to happen to them after the end of December. There was no announcement in relation to a permanent increase to JobSeeker. So we are assuming it will snap back, as the member for Whitlam said, to $40 a day once the JobSeeker coronavirus supplement finishes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do welcome, of course, younger people being a focus of the budget, but it can't be just that and the ignoring of 900,000 people, understanding that the unemployment queues are going to grow on the government's watch and by the government's own admission by about 160,000 by the end of the year. The fact that there is nothing there, particularly in terms of people over the age of 35, is just astounding, and I know this because we've done the research. What's really galling about that is that the bulk of people on JobSeeker over the age of 35 are women. That is the biggest cohort of people on JobSeeker. Women on JobSeeker who are in rental situations are in absolutely dire circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no plan in this budget to support Australians who have lost their jobs. And, as I have said, over 900,000 people on JobSeeker will be excluded from help. In fact, it's 928,000 people on JobSeeker that will be excluded from help. That just seems to me to be incredibly short-sighted. How is that going to give people confidence to go forward? How is that going to give people, who have often been stuck on JobSeeker for a very long time because of things like age discrimination, confidence? If you are on JobSeeker and you're over the age of 60, you have very little chance, because of those pressures, of getting another job. There was nothing in the budget last night to give those people any hope or any feeling that they are being thought about by this particular government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: the people on JobSeeker are probably the most vulnerable people within our society. They have a precarious future. They have to make choices between feeding themselves and their childrenâ€”if they have themâ€”and medication and rent. It's not an academic exercise for those people. They know where every single cent of their money is or is not. And we had a budget last night that made them the least priority of all. There was no priority in the government's thinking about that particular group of people. When you think about the fact that 900,000 Australians, nearly a million Australians, have been ignored by this government, it's a travesty and it's absolutely unfair.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  The MPI today is indeed a matter of public importance because it has shown the stark difference between the Labor Party opposite and this coalition government. By talking down our economic recovery plan, delivered last night, Labor have shown Australians today that they are against building the economy so that we all get ahead; they are against providing incentives to businesses so they can recover, grow and employ more people; they are against job-creating incentives for our young people; and they are against Australians having lower taxes so they can keep more of what they earn. Labor are once again, both in the chamber today and in the Australian community, abandoning the workers of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the Treasurer released the 2020 federal budget and the Morrison government's economic recovery plan for Australia. The economic recovery plan is all about creating jobs, keeping Australians in jobs and supporting our local families. Only the Labor Party could be so blinded by ideological hatred that they don't see Australians are doing it tough because of the COVID recession. It is the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression. Across the world an equivalent of 600 million people have lost their jobs, and Australia is not immune from this. But Australia's health and economic response have been the envy of the world, and there are many aspects of this recovery plan, announced last night, from which our families can draw confidence for the future. JobKeeper, the cashflow boost and the JobSeeker safety net have all worked together to save 700,000 jobs. We could do this because, as a government, we entered this crisis in a position of economic strength with a budget that we brought back into balance for the first time in 11 years. Of course, the Australian people already knew this. They knew that, when they elected this government at the last election, under the leadership of Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, we would be able to manage our economy to cover the case of shocks like this. And thank goodness they made that decision and that the Australian economy was not lumbered with Labor's $387 billion in extra taxes when we took on this crisis and the rebuilding projects that we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the Treasurer spoke about how this budget is a budget that reflects our values, and it does just thatâ€”the values of personal responsibility, reward for effort, the power of aspiration. We are guided by these values, and the Labor members opposite are guided only by their desire for new taxes. We will do as we have done beforeâ€”grow our economy, create new jobs and get our economy back on track. We will do it by backing the private sector. We will provide them with the much-needed kickstart they need to do what they do bestâ€”create jobs. It's business that creates jobs and it's this budget and this government that are helping to create the opportunity for businesses to rebuild and to succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $4 billion JobMaker hiring credit will be payable for up to 12 months for each new job to employers who hire eligible employees aged 16 to 35. Treasury estimates that this will support around 450,000 jobs for young people. Our JobMaker Plan includes the establishment of the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund to create 340,000 jobs or low-cost training places for school leavers and jobseekers. Under this budget, 950,000 new jobs will be created by the government in the next four yearsâ€”950,000! A job isn't just a pay cheque. It's security for your family, it's opportunity and it's independence. It's the ability to give your kids opportunities and make decisions for your family that will see them reach their full potential. Creating these jobs, creating these opportunities for our families, is the core purpose of this government, and nothing Labor says will sway us from this endeavour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is remarkable that the Labor opposition, who love their high-taxing, anti-business agenda so much, could stand in this place and not back a plan that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs for the Australian people and the Australian community. But, of course, they have form. They are doing just that in my state of Queensland, once the powerhouse state of our nation. Even before COVID, I saw Premier Palaszczuk and dodgy Jackie rack up the worst unemployment rate in the entire nation. Luckily, Queenslanders have a choice, in just 24 days time, to vote in the LNP and Deb Frecklington to do exactly what this government is doing, and that is to create jobsâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Sadly, what we're seeing from this Morrison recession, the worst since the Great Depression, is over one million Australians currently unemployed, and, even with over a trillion dollars of debt, 160,000 more Australians are likely to lose their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we see? We saw a whole bunch of grab bag announcements. We saw a whole heap of short-term thingsâ€”a whole heap of reannouncements. But, really, what we didn't see was telling. How do you spend billions and billions more, have a trillion dollars of debt and have no new funding for frontline domestic and family violence services? How do you spend that and do nothing to address the gender pay gap? How do you have a trillion dollars in debt and have nothing on superannuation or about retirement incomes for women? How do you spend billions of dollars and do nothing new on child care? How do you spend billions of dollars and do nothing on social housing? How do you spend billions of dollars and not have any new money for residential aged care, when we have seen what the COVID outbreak has done in residential aged care in Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is shameful that this government has managed to find over $100 billion in new spending and has left all these critical areas out. It has, of course, as I said in my question in question time today, left far too many women behind. What we needed to see from the government was a plan for the futureâ€”a vision, an integrated plan that actually talks about what the role is for all Australians as we recover from what has occurred with the COVID outbreak and as we come out of this Morrison recession. That is not what we saw last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly concerned about the older Australians who were left out of last night's budget. When we look at the royal commission's recommendations, the first recommendation was to fix the home care package waiting list. The government has had the interim report for more than a year. We had 100,000 older Australians waiting then. Here we are, 12 months on, and we still have over 100,000 older Australians waiting for aged care. What did we see in the budget? There are to be 23,000 home care packages delivered over four years. What we have also seen, and what has been revealed recently by the government, is that more than 10,000 older Australians are dying every year without the home care packages that they have been approved for. By the time these new home care packages are delivered, more older Australians will have died waiting for the packages they never get. It is shameful. Once the government called this royal commissionâ€”they go on about it all timeâ€”it was the very first recommendation of the royal commissioners. It was the very first thing they told the government to do a year ago. Sadly, the government are saying they're going to wait for the final report in February next year. That will be too late for far too many older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to pass on my sympathies and condolences to the families of the more than 670 older Australians who have died in residential aged care during the COVID outbreak. I'm sure that everybody in this place joins me when I say they have our deepest, deepest sympathy. We are very concerned that the royal commission report into the outbreak of COVID-19 that was handed down last week was done in the early stages of what happened in Victoria, yet we saw again last night no significant investment from the government in the first recommendation from the royal commission about COVID, which was about more staff. The government haven't even done that; instead, they're saying they're waiting until February. How many more older Australians are going to die in residential aged care because this government did not do its job?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply not good enough, when far too many women are being left behind, when far too many older Australians are being left behind and when far too many Australians generally have been left behind by this budget. The government has managed to spend hundreds of billions more and we are over a trillion dollars in debt. The real question is going to be: what are we going to have to show for it when all this is over and we have generations who will have to repay this government's debt? We need to ensure the money is well spent, and it is not going to be, we can rest assured of that, given their past history. We need to make sure that we have as few people unemployed as possible for as short a time as possible. Sadly, the government is going to fail in that regard, and I am very concerned for all those Australians who have lost their jobs during this recession and the 160,000 Australians who, according to the budget papers, are going to lose their jobs between now and the next budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  The Labor Party has the temerity to come in here today and lecture us about job creation. This from a party that gave us the recession we had to haveâ€”unlike this recession, created by a global pandemic, a recession created by policy decisions of the then Keating government, a recession that gave us 11 per cent unemployment and 34 per cent youth unemployment, a recession for which the response from the Keating government at the time wasn't the sort of positive plans that we saw last night from the Treasurer, wasn't the sort of 'let's get people into jobs' approach of the Morrison government. It was instead a 'wash our hands of the situation, it's all too hard' approach. The employment minister during the Keating recessionâ€”and the minister at the table is right to remind us of this historyâ€”to quote from a journalist at the time, 'Didn't seem to be putting his heart and soul into the portfolio.' Another journalist, who later went to work for him, said 'The greatest ambition harboured by the highly relieved minister was a change in portfolio from employmentâ€”read unemployment.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They didn't have their eye on the job. The Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, didn't have his eye on the job in terms of fixing the unemployment problem. He was padding around the Lodge in his pyjamas, listening to Mahler and coming up with insults for question time rather than focusing on unemployment. We have heard from him recently. The Labor Party in those days used to call him 'captain wacky'. Well, wacky is back and he has a new taxâ€”and his tax is a death tax. I can tell you that most of those opposite have him on speed dial, so you can add the death tax to the $387 billion of new taxes they took to the last election. The truth is that the Labor Party has an abysmal record on employment. Keating himself, in the middle of that recession, famously told a group of students, 'Go get a job.' That's the Labor Party, in the depths of a recession, that's the Labor Party when they are dealing with issues to do with job creation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There could not be a greater contrast than that between the Labor Party and the Keating government and the Morrison government and what we've done in relation to employment. Everything we have done since the start of our government, but particularly since the start of the pandemic, has been focused on job creation. JobSeeker and JobKeeper have created over 700,000 jobsâ€”760,000 jobs have been created since the pandemic started. Sixty per cent of those jobs were for women. Many of the measures in last night's budget were focused on job creation. The JobMaker hiring credit is at the centre of this. It's very important that we get young people who find themselves unemployed into work as soon as possible, because history demonstrates that the longer a person is unemployed at the start of their career the harder it is for them to get into employment and to stay in employment longer term. That's why the hiring credit is so important. It's a program that will create 450,000 jobs. The increase in JobTrainer, which will create 100,000 new apprenticeships, with a 50 per cent wage subsidy, provides new jobs and a pathway to jobs for people. The tax relief for 11 million taxpayers will create 50,000 jobs, as a result of the new economic activity. The instant asset write-off and the loss carry-back provisions will create an additional 50,000 jobs. The infrastructure investmentsâ€”the increase on the 100,000 jobs in infrastructure investments we have already createdâ€”will create an additional 40,000 jobs. The increased home ownership from the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and the HomeBuilder program that we have previously announced, will create more jobs in the housing construction sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These programs are all focused on job creation. So, to hear from the Labor Party that we are not focused on job creation, that we are not putting all of our efforts into giving businesses the opportunity to focus on job creation, to give businesses the tools they need to employ people, is just laughable. It's laughable particularly at a time when it shouldn't be laughable, when we are dealing with the greatest economic crisis Australia has faced since the Great Depression. Our response has been focused on how we get Australians back into jobs. The totality of last night's budget measures will create 950,000 new jobs. These are jobs that are important for Australians, important for our recovery and important for our future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  In 2009, the coalition launched their so-called debt truck. It had on the side of it the figure at which debt was then projected to peakâ€”$315 billion. That's a third of projected peak debt under the Liberals today. If they were being honest then with this budget they would have launched their very own debt road train. What does Australia get for $1 trillionâ€”a one with 12 zeros after it? We don't get the solutions to the economic problems that predated coronavirus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year productivity was going backwards. Wage growth was among the worst on record. We had problems in retail spending and in construction. New car sales were down. Business investment was in the doldrums. So from this budget we need some big aspirations. When Curtin and Chifley sat down towards the end of World War II and thought about what the postwar era needed, they didn't say, 'Let's put the place back together the way it was in 1939.' And similarly today our aspiration should be higher than the economy of 2019.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we were in the Morrison stagnation. This year we're in the Morrison recession. We need to do better than both. We need to recognise that COVID-19 has been a huge hit to human capital. Of course, it's got the physical health impact, but it's got the mental health impact as well. It's hurt education, particularly among disadvantaged students who have gone from being three years behind to, perhaps, four years behind. In workplaces we've seen what economists call 'automation forcing', as firms have invested in machines, displacing workers and potentially making it harder to get unemployment back down again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right response to these challenges would've been to invest in education. Labor's always recognised that technology and education have to go together. Two of my favourite economists, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, say you can think about inequality as being like a race between education and technology. When you have them both running ahead you get growth with equity. When technology advances ahead of education then the gap widens. Low-skilled workers get left behind. That's a real risk for Australia, not just because of the automation forcing that I talked about before but because we've had our test scores going backwards under PISA. We've had a halving in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships. We've had a recapping of university places. It's harder than it used to be for a talented young person to win a spot at university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen out of this budget is huge incentive for capital investment, an instant asset write-off which is going to cost the budget some $27 billion. The fact is that if you do that without investing in skills then you risk leaving workers behind. The workers who are going to be most at risk of being left behind are the over 35s. They're seeing their JobKeeper cut. They're seeing JobSeeker going back to $40 a day at the end of this year. They're seeing young workers who come with a wage subsidy for their employer. Fifty-four per cent of jobs are vulnerable to automation. There's a real risk that under this budget that older workers will be left behind. Between now and the end of the year 160,000 people are forecast to lose their jobs, yet JobKeeper is being cut. One trillion dollars and there's no plan for tackling insecure work, very little for child care, nothing substantial for climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women's economic package is pretty much what you'd expect from a prime minister who names his chooks after former Prime Ministers' wives. This is a government that has delivered sports rorts, reef rorts, Helloworld, Paladin, robodebt, 'DividendKeeper', 'BonusKeeper' and 'watergate', so it's not surprising that Australians don't trust it to not engage in further pork-barrelling. Hope is not a plan. Despite over $1 trillion of debt, the 2020 budget doesn't set up Australia for a productive and egalitarian future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  It's absolutely fantastic that those opposite have given us the opportunity to talk about what we do best: creating jobs and keeping people in jobs. Thank you. Last week, I stood with members of my community on Dunheved Road and announced an extra $63Â½ million, which is in this federal budget, bringing the total amount the Morrison government is contributing to Dunheved Road to $127 million. This is such an important project for our community, because it gets people to work and home again more safely and more quickly and, very importantly, it creates local jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic recovery depends on infrastructure and policies that create jobs. At a local level, I've been working hard to connect our students to the jobs of the future, in industries like manufacturing, in my Lindsay Jobs of the Future Forum. It gives us an opportunity to connect schools with universities and business and to ensure that our children are educated and trained for the jobs that are coming to Western Sydney. In Lindsay, we know that the pathways to those jobs of the future are in emerging industries and also through apprenticeships. I've visited many local manufacturers in Western Sydneyâ€”like Grant Engineered in Emu Plains, who have four young apprentices learning from the best and gaining valuable skills and experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is providing 100,000 new apprenticeships to support the next generation of skilled workers and to help jobseekers reskill and get back into work. This $1.2 billion boosting apprenticeship commencements wage subsidy will help more companies like Grant Engineered to take on apprentices. This comes on the back of our $2.8 billion supporting apprentices and trainees package, now expected to support 90,000 employers to keep 180,000 apprentices and trainees in employment and training. This is all about jobs. Many of these apprentices will go on to contribute to the new era in Australian manufacturing, which will play such an important role in our economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I established the Advancing Manufacturing Taskforce to unlock opportunities that will put Western Sydney at the forefront of the new era and to address any barriers to that. The measures announced in the budget are a win for manufacturers in my electorate of Lindsay, with a range of support to make them more competitive and to create those local jobs. We're investing $1.5 billion over four years for the Modern Manufacturing Strategy and $1.3 billion to support projects within our six national manufacturing priorities. These are critical minerals processing and resources technology; medical productsâ€”and I know that many manufacturers across Lindsay put up their hands during the coronavirus pandemic to manufacture critical supplies and medical products; defence industry; space industryâ€”again, there's a growing space industry in Western Sydney, with the building of the Western Sydney International Airport, and I look forward to our children having the opportunities of the jobs in this emerging space industry; clean energy and recycling; and food and beverage products. We're also expanding the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund, and I know that many businesses across Western Sydney, as well as Western Sydney University, took advantage of this fund. There's $100 million for the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative to address and identify our supply chain vulnerabilities. The coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated that we need to harness our own strengths, particularly in supply chains, when it comes to manufacturing. This will support businesses in Lindsay like SpanSet, Solution Design Group, Pandrol and J Sinclair Engineering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $5.3 billion investment in the Western Sydney airport and aerotropolis precinct will create a hub for emerging industries in advanced manufacturing, defence industry, research, medicine and more. It couldn't be more about jobs, what's going on in Western Sydney, and I'm so proud of the work that we are doing there. These skills reforms will contribute to supporting the creation of local jobs for local people so that people don't have to commute long hours out of our community every single day. Three hundred thousand people currently commute from Western Sydney to their job.</span>

This is an interim report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry into homelessness in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2016 census data, more than 116,000 people are homeless or living in insecure or substandard housing in Australia. That's a rate of 49.8 homeless persons for every 10,000 of our population. Homelessness is not distributed evenly either. Certain geographic, demographic and social groups are particularly vulnerable to homelessness and are overrepresented among the homeless. At the outset, it is important to recognise that housing and homelessness is the principal responsibility of the state and territory governments. That said, the federal government provides some $6.2 billion in assistance to the sector in the form of $4.6 billion a year in a Commonwealth rent assistance, and $1.6 billion to the states under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. It provides concessional loans for community housing providers and housing development infrastructure, to name just a few. I note the Treasurer announced last night in the budget that an additional $1 billion of low-cost finance will support the construction of affordable housing, taking the concessional finance available to CHPs to $3 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even as the committee's inquiry commenced in February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was arriving in Australia. As the virus spread, the committee quickly realised it would have major implications for people at risk of or experiencing homelessness and the governments and organisations who work with them. After suspending the inquiry briefly in response to the virus in May 2020, the committee reopened submissions and called for evidence, particularly on the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness. We encouraged community groups and others to share their experiences in responding to the pandemic. By the beginning of October, the committee had received close to 200 submissions, most of which discussed the COVID-19 situation, some in great detail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between June and August, we spoke to 40 government and non-government organisations at five public hearings, many which were held by teleconference. I'd like to express the committee's great appreciation to the many people and organisations who have taken the time and made the effort to engage with us and contribute to this inquiry at a time when they had much more to deal with on their plates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence received by the committee shows the COVID-19 pandemic has affected those at risk of or experiencing homelessness in a range of ways, most of them negative. COVID-19 has increased and complicated demands for services and responses from all levels of government. It has imposed new challenges and additional pressures on the numerous hardworking community organisations that support and assist people facing homelessness and housing insecurity across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report summarises the issues and perspectives raised in the evidence received by the committee in relation to COVID-19 and homelessness in Australia. The committee considered it was important to present this interim report now so that the evidence could be considered by the executive in a timely way, even though the pandemic and its effects are yet to be fully realised. The interim report does not make recommendations, as both the COVID-19 situation and government's response to it continue to evolve. Rather, the committee encourages the Australian government to consider the evidence offered in this report and take it into account as it continues to formulate its immediate and long-term responses to the pandemic, including in cooperation with the states and territories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope this report can contribute to the efforts of governments at all levels to respond appropriately, compassionately and wisely to the problem of homelessness in the time of COVID-19. Homelessness existed before the pandemic and will sadly, surely, endure beyond it. However, the current circumstances create a particularly urgent challenge and opportunity to ensure that as many Australians as possible are safely and securely housedâ€”that they can find shelter in a storm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's inquiry is not complete and we will continue our work of examining the problem of homelessness in Australia, in accordance with the full terms of reference. We will present a final report, including recommendations, at the conclusion of the inquiry. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank my deputy chair and all members of the committee for their hard work. It has been a challenge doing most of this inquiry over videoconference and teleconference, but, hopefully, we'll get some good outcomes as a result of it. Until then, I commend this report to the House.</span>

We certainly note and appreciate that you were asked to make a contribution to a really critical issue in Australian social policy at a time you were probably most stretched and most pushed as providers of housing in Australiaâ€”during the COVID-19 pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly had a housing crisis before COVID-19, but the pandemic has left so many more Australians vulnerable and exposed. Veterans; young Australians; First Nations people; older single women; and women and children fleeing violent relationships are all groups of people who have experienced shamefully high levels of homelessness. And we now have a shortage of almost half a million social housing dwellings in Australia. Add to this the perilous state of the economy and the fact that the moratoriums on rental evictions are now drawing to a close at the same time that income support is being reduced, and you have a recipe for the rapid deterioration of what was already a crisis situation. The problem is urgent and it demands an urgent response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this, I will put on record Labor's disappointment that the interim report on homelessness has been released today without any recommendations. I note that the chair made the comment that there will be a final report with recommendations later in the year, but this is budget week. This is the week when governments very clearly set out for the nation the priorities of government. This report is silent on recommendations to address homelessness in this very important week, and I think that is a missed opportunity. But make no mistake: submitters and witnesses to our inquiry have had a very clear and consistent message for the committee and for the federal government, which is: 'Invest in building new social housing and repair existing stock. And do it now.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular proposal identified as the Social Housing Acceleration and Renovation Program, or SHARP, had the support of many submitters. We know that investment in social housing works because we've already done it. Indeed, the former Labor government invested more than $5 billion in the construction of nearly 20,000 new social housing dwellings and repaired a further 80,000 existing public housing properties as part of its response to the global financial crisis. As Ms Wendy Hayhurst from the Community Housing Industry Association said, SHARP, the Social Housing Acceleration and Renovation Program, offers 'an immediate opportunity to kickstart both our country's post-COVID recovery and reductions in the social housing shortfall'. But, despite this clear message, yesterday's federal budget offered nothing to address this diabolical social problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the chair's mention of the budget measure around NHFIC and being able to extend the cap toâ€”from memoryâ€”$3 billion, but I note that the next dot point immediately after that in Budget Paper No. 2 said that the government was now going to spend some money doing an independent review of NHFIC in order to see if it was in fact meeting the aims of Australian housing and obligations in that regard. That worries me. It worries me greatly if the government doesn't have confidence right now that that fund is doing what it is meant to be doing. I think that is a matter that this committee may need to explore further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there wasn't a single dollar in the federal budget last night for social housing, despite the fact that we know it would deliver some of the biggest impacts that we could get for our budget dollars right now. Rather than increasing the common wealth and building homes for vulnerable Australians, the Morrison government instead focused on giving money to existing property owners to undertake very expensive renovations in their homesâ€”renovations that were probably already going to take place, if truth were told. That does raise a question for me around the priorities that were mapped out. If a budget sets out the government's priorities, I have concerns now about what those priorities are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's one thing we've learned from COVID-19, it's that, when there is political will, we can move mountains, so I remain forever optimistic that, notwithstanding what appear to be some insurmountable policy problems, we can put ideological objections to one side and do what is good for Australian citizens. There can be no more important job for a government than to ensure safe, secure, and affordable housing for its citizens. It is a very base need for every person in this country, and it is the responsibility of governments from all jurisdictions. Indeed, that is an issue that the committee will need to tackle. Housing and homelessness is everybody's problem. We've heard that repeated by witnesses again and again. The Commonwealth has a leading role to play in that. Perhaps there is an opportunity to make better use of the national cabinet to devise a framework that might find sustainable solutions to housing and homelessness in Australia. We need the government to really take that leadership role and see if it can make some serious inroads into what has been a truly wicked and complex problem across multiple jurisdictions in Australia. As such, the Commonwealth needs to step up, do the heavy lifting and take a leadership role in bringing the states and territories along with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody needs a home. It's time really for the government to ensure that that is a lived reality for the Australian people.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâ€”I rise today to present a statement of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for the review of regulations listing the Islamic State West Africa Province and relisting Boko Haram, Islamic State and Islamic State East Asia as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995. Regulations that specify an organisation as a terrorist organisation cease to have an effect on the third anniversary of the day on which they take effect. Organisations can be relisted provided the minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation continues to directly or indirectly engage in terrorism or advocate the doing of a terrorist act. Boko Haram and Islamic State were last listed in 2017. The regulations to relist them and to list Islamic State West Africa Province were tabled in the parliament on 24 August 2020. A regulation to relist Islamic State East Asia was tabled in parliament on 6 October 2020.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's review examined the minister's decision to list and relist these organisations. Section 102.1A of the Criminal Code provides that the committee may review a regulation that lists or relists an organisation as a terrorist organisation and report its comments and recommendations to each house of the parliament before the end of the applicable 15 sitting day disallowance period. This statement serves this purpose and is being presented within the required period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In determining whether the regulations listing or relisting these four organisations should be supported, the committee reviewed the merits of each in accordance with the Minister for Home Affairs's explanatory statement, ASIO's statement of reasons for each organisation and other publicly available information. In its deliberations, the committee determined that Boko Haram still follows an extreme interpretation of Islam which is anti-Western, promotes sectarian violence, and targets those who do not agree with its interpretation. Although no Australian citizens have been killed by Boko Haram, the group has repeatedly issued statements threatening Western interests, which includes Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Islamic State continues to be a Sunni extremist group that adheres to an extreme interpretation of Islam and promotes a global jihadist ideology. Following a loss of territory in Syria and Iraq, Islamic State has reverted to a clandestine insurgency and remains one of the world's deadliest and most active terrorist organisations. Islamic State West Africa Province was previously known as an alias for Boko Haram. In March 2015 Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau's pledged allegiance to Islamic State was accepted and the group commenced operations under the name ISWAP. A dispute over the leadership of ISWAP in 2016 resulted in the emergence of two factions of the group. Although Boko Haram has not officially split from ISWAP, the groups are assessed to operate independently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ISWAP follows an extreme interpretation of Islam and continues to achieve their means through violence. Islamic State in East Africa continues to be affiliated with Islamic State and is comprised of members who were previously aligned with other Islamist extremist groups, including the Abu Sayyaf Group. It is probable that Australians could be harmed, in the future activities of the group, due to the considerable Australian business interests and the number of Australians in the Philippines. These organisations remain a real threat to Australia. There is strong evidence that each has, and continues to engage in, terrorist activities that are targeted at countries with Western values. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In examining the evidence that has been provided, the committee is satisfied with the relisting and listing processes and considers that they have been followed appropriately for these four organisations. The committee therefore supports the listing of the organisations, under division 102 of the Criminal Code, in order to protect Australians and Australia's interests, and finds no reason to disallow the regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now speak to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual report of committee activities 2019-2020</span>. I present the committee's annual report of its activities for 2019 and 2020. This report details the activities that the committee has undertaken during the last financial year. Transparency is important to the Australian people and so we aim to conduct our oversight of the national intelligence community in public as much as we can. This year the committee has adapted to the challenges brought by COVID-19. We welcome the patience shown by the intelligence agencies as we have incorporated a new level of technology into our work. This has enabled us to continue our oversight despite the separation imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From June 2019 the committee undertook 15 inquiries and tabled seven reports. We have conducted inquiries into a variety of proposed legislation, including identity-matching services as well as amendments to passport and counterterrorism legislation. Inquiries into citizenship cessation, the expansion of ASIO powers and international production orders continues to progress into the next financial year. The committee also undertook statutory reviews into existing legislation covering telecommunications, mandatory data retention, citizenship loss and declared area provisions. In addition, the committee reviewed and supported the listing of one terrorist organisation and the relisting of 10 terrorist organisations pursuant to section 102 of the Criminal Code. The impact of COVID-19 was unavoidable, so the committee has postponed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of administration and expenditure: No. 18</span>. We will include this in the next administration and expenditure review towards the end of the year, where we can gather, hopefully, and have classified hearings to that end. Despite the challenges of 2020 I am pleased with the work completed by the committee, which is summarised in this report. As the security environment continues to change, the scope and the role of the committee has expanded, as has the workload. A case in point was the unique inquiry into press freedoms, which was a first for the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the changes of the past decade I think it's time to review the Intelligence Services Act and consider the role, powers and resources invested in this committee. I also look forward to the publication of the Richardson review, which will shape the framework of both the Australian intelligence community and its oversight bodies, including this committee. The responsibility and functions of the PJCIS are important. They bring legislative accountability and oversight of our intelligence agencies and we as a committee take this role very seriously. It's a privilege to serve the Australian people in this way. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SHARMA:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâ€”Today I am pleased to make some very brief remarks in relation to the two reports presented today. Report 190 considers matters relating to actions being taken by the Australian government, which will effectively suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong and the mutual legal assistance treaty with Hong Kong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was recently made aware of the actions proposed by the Australian government, and agreed to a request from the Attorney-General to consider these matters urgently. The evidence gathered by the committee established that a strong public foundation existed for the actions of the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard that the imposition by China of its national security law in Hong Kong had fundamentally altered Hong Kong's status and raised serious concerns about the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong, the continued application of the rule of law in Hong Kong and other fundamental principles of justice. The committee heard that this constituted a fundamental change of circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, the committee unanimously endorsed the actions of the Australian government to protect the integrity of our international law enforcement arrangements and uphold the rights of our citizens by suspending these two treaties. The committee will continue to take a close interest in political developments in Hong Kong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding report 191, this considers three separate arrangements relating to Australia's commitments and involvement with the International Monetary Fund. The committee has recommended that Australia agree to the IMF reform proposals to better combat the global economic impact of COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Report 191, released today, supports three treaties that will give the IMF access to the funds it needs to support countries dealing with the severe economic downturn that has accompanied the pandemic. Two of the treaties involve the direct transfer of a portion of Australia's commitments from the third line of defence supporting IMF lending, called bilateral loan agreements, to the IMF's second line of defence, called new arrangements to borrow. The third treaty is a commitment by Australia to the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The trust is already involved in supporting the COVID-19 response in lower income countries by providing the funds needed to purchase essential medical equipment. None of the three treaties involves additional financial commitments by Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has had a massive global economic impact, and this is being felt in Australia. For Australia's sake, we need to be doing all we can to support global economic recovery, and these reforms to the IMF will help do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the work of the deputy chair and other members of the committee in allowing prompt consideration of these important and urgent treaty actions, and their cooperation in producing these reports in a timely manner. I commend the reports to the House.</span>

As the member for Wentworth noted, there was agreement on the report. The opposition, and myself as deputy chair, supported the government's decision to suspend the two treaties with Hong Kong, namely the Agreement for the Surrender of Accused and Convicted Persons between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong, the extradition treaty, and also the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong concerning Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Mattersâ€”the MLA treaty.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that, when situations change that cause us to re-examine our treaty arrangements and their integrity, the JSCOT, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, is able to seek views widely and to consider the impacts before any suspensions come into effect, and I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General and the government for affording the committee the opportunity to make this examination and this inquiry possible. And thank you to all of those who made submissions and those who attended the public hearings at very short notice as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance of this is very important because, following the passage of the national security laws that eroded Hong Kong's independent legal status, there were calls for the urgent review of Australia's extradition treaty with Hong Kong. I believe the inquiry was necessary, given the need to ensure the funding and integrity of Australia's international law enforcement cooperation and our extradition frameworks for this inquiry to proceed, and for us to table this report. I thank the JSCOT chair, the member for Wentworth, and all the members of the JSCOT secretariat for their hard work and assistance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  [by video link] by leaveâ€”The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System was established in September 2019 and initially had a final reporting date of today, 7 October 2020. Submissions were due on 18 December 2019 and extensive rounds of public and in camera hearings were planned over the first half of this year. Like many in the community, the work of the committee has been delayed by travel and other restrictions imposed through the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence the committee was unable to travel after the first five hearings in February and March of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee continued to receive a large number of requests, particularly from individuals, to provide late submissions and appear before the committee, to provide evidence of their experience of Australia's family law system. To ensure that the committee heard from a wide cross-section of the community on these issues the committee has continued to accept submissions and has held an additional six public and 10 in camera hearings by video and teleconference since May this year. In all, the committee has received over 1,600 submissions and heard from 67 organisations and individuals in a total of 11 public hearings and 85 individuals during 13 in camera hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 August this year both houses of parliament agreed to extend the reporting date for this inquiry to the last sitting day of February 2021. This extension has provided the committee with additional time to comprehensively consider the significant body of evidence that has been received. The first stage of that consideration has been the development of this interim report. The report summarises the wide range of issues and viewpoints raised during the inquiry. Importantly, the committee has included quotes from de-identified individual submitters and witnesses whose evidence was received in camera. The committee thanks all those individuals for agreeing to the publication of this material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has not arrived at any conclusions or made any recommendations in this interim report about the information provided, however, believed it was important to make public the wide range of issues that have been raised with it during the course of the inquiry. The committee's final report will contain detailed consideration of matters relevant to the terms of reference and the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report is comprehensive, running to 12 chapters and over 300 pages. This is reflective of the breadth of the issues that have been raised with the committee. The interim report has been arranged thematically into chapters and covers the following areas. First is systemic issues such as perceptions of bias within the system, the role of family consultants and expert witnesses, whether the adversarial nature of the family courts could be improved, misuse of systems and processes and professional misconduct. Second is legal fees and other costs of the family law system. Third is delays in the Family Court. Fourth is issues in relation to family violence and the family law system. Later chapters examine issues arising in parenting and property disputes, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and support services available in the family law system, as well as interaction between the child support and the family law systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the members of the committee for their commitment and engagement in this very broad ranging, complex and at times emotional inquiry. The committee has heard some very personal and heart-wrenching accounts of people's experience of family separation and their navigation of the family law system. The committee expresses its thanks to all those individuals and organisations that have made written submissions. The opportunity to hear directly from so many people about their experiences with the family law system has significantly enhanced the committee's work, and the committee thanks all submitters for sharing their personal stories. The committee wishes to acknowledge those individuals who shared their private circumstances and experiences with the family law system at the committee's in camera hearings. The opportunity to speak with so many people, to hear a diverse range of experiences, to ask questions about the failings in the system from the viewpoint of those most affected and to receive proposals for improving the system will greatly assist the further deliberations of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee appreciates that the recounting of those experiences can be difficult and traumatic, and the committee thanks those individuals for bringing such a candid and personal perspective to the inquiry. Similarly, the committee extends its thanks to the organisations, academics and professionals who provided submissions and appeared at public hearings. This evidence has greatly enhanced the committee's understanding of the various elements of the family law system and identified a number of areas of further interest for consideration in the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee proposes to hold at least one further private hearing prior to the completion of the final report. To date, the committee has not heard from a significant stakeholderâ€”namely, the family courtsâ€”having resolved to first hear from individuals and organisations of their experience of the system. The committee will then have a significant body of evidence to consider in developing its final recommendations, and I look forward to presenting on behalf of the committee the final report by the end of February next year. I take this opportunity to thank not only all the members of the committee but indeed the members of the secretariat for their significant efforts during the course of this inquiry. I commend the interim report to the House.</span>

I particularly thank the chair for the great workâ€”the way he has handled people who come to this inquiry with a lot of issues, sometimes. The committee's interim report documents the extensive work undertaken thus far, as detailed by the chair. The committee has received more than 1,500 individual submissions and 163 submissions by organisations. Although hearings have continued by teleconference and videoconference, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the work of the inquiry. In these circumstances it was perfectly reasonable to extend the reporting date to the last sitting day in February 2021.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I admit that I commenced this inquiry with some genuine concerns about yet another inquiry into family law being instigated while many recommendations from recent previous inquiries had not been acted upon and in some cases not even responded to by the Morrison government. The two most recent reportsâ€”the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry into a better family law system to support and protect those affected by family violence, chaired by Senator Henderson, which was tabled in December 2017, and the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into the family law system, <span style="font-style:italic;">Family law for the future: an inquiry into the family law system</span>, tabled in March 2019â€”have a combined 93 recommendations to the government to improve the family law system. The vast majority of these recommendations have not been acted on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these concerns, I've taken my role in this committee seriously. I've engaged with the inquiry process in good faith and have diligently participated in the conduct of this inquiry so far. The committee has heard from many submitters. We've heard personal stories of pain and anguish when navigating a family law system that is at breaking point. We have heard from frontline workers who do incredible work with very little government support. And we have heard some interesting ideas for reform that should be given due consideration by this committee. Labor members of this committee have included some additional comments in the interim report, including some interim recommendations. While this inquiry continues to its conclusion early next year, the family law system continues to buckle right now through neglect. Families are suffering because of the inaction of the government to implement changes that have already been recommended in report after report after report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are recommendations for reform, common to many previous inquiries and reports, that have established and continued support, including from witnesses and submitters to this inquiry. These reforms should not need to wait for this inquiry to be finalised before being implemented. Labor members have made seven recommendations for urgent reforms that the government could implement right now. The eighth recommendation by Labor members is for the government's bills that would merge the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to be abandoned. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ironic that there are plenty of reform ideas that have been recommended time and time again by various inquiries, even with majority Liberal numbers on those inquiries, and reports that the government ignores but that the one reform it is doggedly pursuing has not been recommended by any parliamentary inquiry and has not been recommended by any academic paper. It has only been recommended by a six-week desktop accounting review, which qualified its recommendations to say that if the Australian Law Reform Commission review did not make the same recommendation then any decision for reform should only be made on the advice of court stakeholders, who should consider what would bring about the greatest positive outcomes. Of course, the ALRC review actually did not recommend merging the courts. This inquiry has heard witness after witness tell the committee that the government's plan to merge the courts is a terrible idea; it will hurt families. The merger bills should be abandoned and should be abandoned right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore members on the government benches to consider the additional comments by Labor members and the eight recommendations for reform. The safety and wellbeing of families and children should be a priority of the Morrison government. I hope that the Attorney-General hears this plea. At the conclusion of my submission, I move: </span>

Carers Week runs from 11 to 17 October, and it's a time to recognise the more than 2.65 million Australians who provide care and support to a family member or friend with a disability, a mental health condition, a chronic condition, a terminal illness, an alcohol or drug issue, or those who are frail and elderly. Think about that. If you're not an unpaid carer some of the time, your neighbours probably are. Anyone at any time could become a carer. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report by Mental Health Australia illustrates just how COVID has hit carers very hard. It shows that support for carers and participants in the NDIS fell away. It also shows that families stepped into the breach when carers weren't able to be there and when providers dropped off. Carers were an at-risk cohort, so they carried a really huge load throughout COVID and continue to today. This parliament says thank you to all the carers, who have given up hours of their time and who save taxpayers so much money, but they do it because they love and care for the person that they want to spend time with. So thank you to everyone in the electorate of Macquarie who is a carer.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I would like to join my colleagues in making a contribution to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill. I should say from the outset that Labor is supporting the passage of the bill. We certainly welcome the measures in this bill to the extent that they aim to strengthen the powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. By the way, what is in this bill is not the panacea for issues that confront the NDIS. It doesn't resolve all the problems associated with the administration of the NDIS, but it's certainly another step to rectify some of the ongoing issues and, in this case, problems that have led to drastic and devastating outcomes in the delivery of care itself. We welcome the measures in the bill and, as I say, Labor will be supporting them. Nevertheless, we're not going to let the government simply say, 'This is it.' This is, as I say, just one more step in a long process of rectification. The bill does not even come close to fixing the mess that this government has made in respect of the NDIS, and, to that extent, the NDIS safeguard framework in its ability to prevent abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted, as my colleagues have, the words that the Treasurer used last night when he spoke about the NDIS. He said: 'Funding of the NDIS is guaranteed. Government is spending a further $3.9 billion, ensuring that Australians eligible for the NDIS have access to support they need now and into the future.' I would have thought that would've been universally welcome. But those on the opposite benches should recall back to the previous budget. Remember that the government took $4.6 billion out of the NDIS, and not because it wasn't needed to help people with special needs or to assist people with disabilities. It was taken out to prop up a failing budget. It helped improve the budget bottom line. It was a 'book entry', as someone wanted to refer to it. This is money that should've been retained within the system. So I'm not sure that people are going to be on all fours thanking the Treasurer for simply putting some of that money back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about the most vulnerable in our community. And it beggars belief that we have a situation where we get step-by-step adjustments when it comes to the administration of the NDIS itself. We have seen 1,200 Australians with a disability tragically die while waiting to be funded under the NDISâ€”and under this government's watch. This is simply not good enough for the standards of a country such as ours, a developed country and a country, I would have thought, that is made up of members on both sides of the House who have some element of care for such a vulnerable group as those with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, this bill makes two fundamental changes to the NDIS commissioner's ability to make banning orders against a worker. Firstly, it gives the commissioner the power to issue a banning order against a person who is no longer employed or engaged by the NDIS, and, secondly, it gives the commissioner the power to make a pre-emptive banning order against a person, whether individual or otherwise, who has been identified as unsuitable to work with people with a disability as a result of their actions in another field, such as in aged care or in child care. On the face of it, that's a good thing: to be proactive and to ensure that people who have such extraordinary responsibilities as carers are people of good character and are competent and committed to the task.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment will also empower the commissioner to include details of the order, including enough information to identify the person, in the publicly available NDIS provider register. I note that highly sensitive information or details about the nature of the incident that has prompted the response will not be included in the register, because of various privacy issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill is a direct response to an actual issue. It's a direct response to the death of Ann-Marie Smith. Mr Deputy Speaker, you'll know this intimately, because it occurred in your state. Ann-Marie Smith was a 54-year-old Adelaide NDIS participant who died on the 6 April from severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and other issues connected with her cerebral palsy, after being confined to a cane chair for 24-hours a day for more than a year. I think I probably speak for everyone in this House when I say that, when we read those accounts, none of us could believe this occurred under our collective watch. Why would it? We have an organisation. We have the NDIS. We have a regulatory framework. How did this pass muster? And yet, it did, with deadly consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie Smith's NDIS package included six hours of support per day. Reports said that she only received two hours a day and had not been seen outside her house for years. That should have rung a few alarm bells, I would have thought, particularly for those responsible for overseeing the conduct within the system. Ann-Marie's tragic death is nothing short of unbelievable neglect. If there's one positive out of this dreadful situation, it's that the case has prompted this government to come to terms with the failures of the system and identify the gaps which this bill now seeks to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, even with the changes outlined in the bill, the death of Ann-Marie Smith would not have been prevented. This is because the carer was an employee at the time of the abuse. This means there was something else still at play and is yet to be addressed. It goes to the heart of the issueâ€”that is, the failure of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to ensure it is monitoring and exercising the punitive powers where appropriate. In other words, it's got to do its job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We expect those on the Treasury benches to ensure the commission is sufficiently charged with its legal responsibility to do its job. On the measures in this bill, El Gibbs from People with Disability Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recent death of Ann Marie Smith, and other abuse of people with disability, have exposed the many gaps that exist in the current system â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next steps need to ensure the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has the power and resources to proactively investigate the conduct with random spot checks on disability support providers. Essentially, that's the same sort of thing we have demanded and now have in aged care. To that extent, we have random spot checks taking place now. It's absolutely cold comfort to think we were relying on the South Australian Police force to actually do an investigation and eventually lay charges, in relation to manslaughter, against a carer due to criminal neglect that occurred. This is not simply a matter of law enforcement; this is a matter that should not have occurred. We need a system that works and works for people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of times that the commission has used its monitoring powers is not recorded. However, consultation with unions and advocacy groups confirmed that most of the work undertaken by the commission is reactive and focuses on incidents that have already happened. We need to do better than that. Likewise, the minister has stated there's only been 13 banning orders issued to providers in the last 18 months, despite 1,422 complaints that have been made over the same period. I ask those opposite: if the commission has real regulatory powers and functions, why isn't it overseeing the care of people, and why is it that nothing occurred in looking after the needs of Ann-Marie? This is an indictment not on our system but on the exercise of these regulatory powers. The government must provide answers to these and ensure that there are proper plans in place of what it intends to do to ensure the commission's powers are being used properly and administered appropriately. Everything should be directed to preventing abuse and neglect in the first place. A slap on the wrist is not sufficient. Ann-Marie's service provider received a fine of $12,600 after allowing her carer to neglect her so severely and for so long. That is not satisfactory. It is highly offensive and it is disrespectful to the families who have endured a similar fate. And it is not appropriate to think: 'We have the men and women in blue. They can go out and conduct the investigations and, if they think there is neglect, lay criminal charges.' This is something that we must get on top of, and not just in terms of the bill that's before us. We must do this very, very thoroughly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a vital service. After seven years of Liberal neglect, it has been slashed and mismanaged to such an extent that people are dying of neglect in their own homes. While we are supportive of the amendments in this bill, we call on the minister and the government to start taking seriously the interests of all Australians, particularly the most vulnerable Australiansâ€”those with a disability. Our approach must be focused on ensuring that we never again see a case like what happened to Ann-Marie Smith. All of us in this place have a responsibility to ensure that the kind of system failure that resulted in death by neglected needs doesn't happen again. Government must work beyond the measures of this bill. It owes it to all Australians living with a disability, and their families, to ensure that it is overseeing to the utmost the best system of care that can be provided to vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that next week is Carers Week, and I would like to note for the record not only our support but our thanks for carers. The truth of the matter is that carers make an extraordinary difference for the better in our community, and we owe it to them to support them and, above all, to thank them for their service. As a community, we are indebted to them for their efforts.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I would also like to start today by acknowledging that it is Carers Week next week and, along with many other members of this House, express my thanks to the carers for the really diligent work they do for those more vulnerable in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is now a foundational pillar of Australian society and a symbol of our fair go for all. The NDIS provides over 360,000 Australians with the support they need to maximise their opportunities, their happiness and their prosperity. It's therefore essential that we are constantly striving to improve and reach these ideals and ensure that the system is working to the best of its ability. This bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020, will make technical amendments to ensure that the scheme's participants are safe and looked after. In many cases, we've dropped the ball on this. While the system helps many, there are still many who become victims of callous indifference. This bill amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 to broaden the circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner may make a banning order against a National Disability Insurance Scheme provider or other persons, and it clarifies the commissioner's related powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important amendment. Firstly, of course, it is about thanking the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission for working under the exceptional circumstances we've had over the last few months. It hasn't been easy to adapt and provide the same level of care, with the added anxiety, safety conditions and regulations, so I commend the commission for that. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner may already make banning orders. A banning order can be made against providers or persons employed by providers, and it restricts specific activities. It is usually a remedy that's a serious response to very serious and dangerous conduct. According to the commission, it is intended to apply to an NDIS provider or person employed or otherwise engaged by an NDIS provider in circumstances where it's the most appropriate regulatory option available to prevent people with disability from experiencing harm arising from poor quality or unsafe services provided under the NDIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A banning order may only be made in accordance with natural justice principles, of course, where the person has been given an opportunity to make submissions to the commissioner on the matter, except in the following circumstances: where there is immediate danger to the health, safety or wellbeing of a person with disability and where the commissioner has revoked the registration of the NDIS provider. The evidence brought before the disability royal commission and the various media investigations indicate that this kind of power is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard in this place of horrendous eventsâ€”the death of Ann-Marie Smith, who suffered from severe pressure sores and malnutrition after being left in a cane chair every day for more than a year. It's hard to imagine or contemplate that as a society we failed so badly. This is such a serious example of the kind of misconduct that must be addressed and now will be addressed with this amendment. Two weeks ago the commissioner used these powers and banned disability care agency Integrity Care for the appalling circumstances leading to her death. We must do all we can to stop negligent behaviour that can leave lasting, and potentially fatal, impacts on individuals and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the current provisions is that, once an individual leaves their place of employment, the commissioner is not able to issue a banning order preventing their return to the scheme. Leaving or being terminated from a place of employment is common in individuals who are prone to these kinds of behaviours, and it's a loophole that must be closed. The bill amends provisions to ensure that the commissioner can make a banning order and stop an individual from re-entering the disability workforce. Importantly, the bill allows data from outside the NDIS to form the evidence for banning orders, so preventing unsuitable persons from entering the NDIS in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NDIS providers in Warringah have been doing a phenomenal job in the circumstances. I am sensitive to any arrangements adding further complications to their day-to-day operations. After reaching out to them, they wish to raise some operational considerations for this bill's provisions: the need for a confidential process to be in place to enable providers to confirm the identity of a person named on a register due to insufficient data on the summary provided by the NDIS register; the need for flexibility in arrangements for banning orders to apply to individuals who have changed name or gender; and consideration of the interaction with employee record exemptions under the Privacy Act 1988 and how providers will have to update their privacy policies, which could take some time. I urge the government to be generous in their extension of time to providers to update their system and work with them to ensure the best care possible is available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past two years certain providers have also noticed a significant push from NDIS planners for NDIS recipients to utilise their packages under self-managed funding, with planners identifying this option as having more choice and control. Participants utilising self-managed funding are more vulnerable to providers or persons who don't meet NDIS standards or have been banned under the requirements of the proposed bill. The commission has been talking about implementing its national approach to worker screening arrangements, including the development of a worker screening database, which is currently in transition. This means all the various state based arrangements remain in place. I urge the commission to accelerate the implementation of the database so that individuals who opt for self-managed funding will still have the quality of care they are entitled to and are safe from negligent and predatory individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a hard period for the disabled and their families. The lockdown has stretched their capacity to cope. Some have come close to breaking point. In May and June this year, Every Australian Counts surveyed over 740 people with disabilities, about their experiences of the first wave of the pandemic, and their experiences are significant and need to be heard. In the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Left out and locked down</span> some said they felt forgotten and ignored by the government and community during the pandemic. Thirty-two per cent said their costs had increased and many were under water, financially. They cited a complicated NDIS process and lengthy delays that were exhausting and threatening to their health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The survey participants have six clear requests for the government. The first is recognition of the additional costs incurred as a result of their disability and the provision of additional financial support. This includes additional PPE, additional technology and data to attend telehealth and phone planning services, and the added expenses of online shopping. The second is clear, simple communication, which was a strong request. They want to know what is happening, when it is happening and what any change means for them. This includes information in all accessible formats, like Auslan and Easy Read, and translation into other languages. The third is that participants want extra support from the NDIS. This includes additional funding but also assistance to help reorganise supports or find additional services and being able to use the funding in the way that works best for them, to not have to ask for reviews every time they want to move funds from one item to the next. The fifth is simpler, easier and quicker processes. Participants found that in the middle of a pandemic they could not maintain the number of phone calls, emails or follow-ups to get an outcome. They found it frustrating and, in some cases, life-threatening. The sixth is that they need simpler resources for actions and better training for LACS and NDIS staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Good intentions are no substitute for the experience and knowledge necessary to work effectively and respectfully with people with disability and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to similar feedback I've heard from disability advocacy groups in Warringah. They've found that in general there has been a steady improvement to the quality of plans and there is a greater consistency and quality. But some families and participants are often desperate to get a planner who has expertise and understanding. They are calling for a system where there can be confidence in all planners to deliver consistent high-quality plans. I agree. No participant should be negatively impacted by a plan that is produced by a planner who does not have the skills to provide this essential service at an appropriate level. This means having relevant qualifications, communication skills and continued comprehensive training and support across the country. I hope that the extra $800 million over four years, provided for the last night's budget for the NDIS, will go some way to addressing some of these concerns. It would assist stakeholders and decision-makers if there were a more detailed breakdown of what this extra funding will go towards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the measures announced in last night's budget. The $125 million, over three years, for the new disability support for older Australians will allow disabled elderly Australians to access the same services as covered under the NDIS, if they're not eligible for that scheme. The $27.9 million, over two years, for extra community support for these individuals will assist with this. This is a compassionate response. I have certainly received a lot of feedback from constituents in these situations. This will give them confidence that they can still enjoy a quality of life in their later years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, industry associations, like People with Disability, have provided feedback on some of the more substantial measures in the bill, including the wage subsidy. They stated that they would like to see more incentives for young people with disabilities. These young people already face large barriers to enter the workforce. They also have concerns that the two $250 payments for people on allowances like the disability pension are insufficient to compensate for the increasing costs they face during COVID-19. These people have already missed out on both the JobKeeper and JobSeeker supplements. This bill is an important amendment that will protect families and participants from negligent behaviour, and I certainly welcome it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  Earlier this year, I made a speech in this place where I outlined a number of failings with respect to the operation of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission in South Australia. The ongoing revelations in the matter of Ann-Marie Smith and the actions of her registered provider, Integrity Care, have done little to alleviate my concerns. Two subsequent independent reports on the matter prepared by the South Australian government task force and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission respectively have only confirmed the views of the whistleblowers who have approached my officeâ€”namely, that structural impediments are placing those who are living with a disability at serious risk of harm and neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While both reports made a number of recommendations, of particular note is the need for the commission to act earlier to identify those people with disability who are vulnerable to harm or neglect, the importance of ensuring that no one person is responsible for the care needs of a participant and the need to appoint a specific person with overall responsibility for that participant's safety and wellbeing. I understand these recommendations have received the support of National Disability Services, the Australian peak industry body for non-government disability service providers, and I look forward to working with the NDS and others to ensure that these recommendations do not fade into the ether. In the meantime, I welcome the government's attempt to improve the safeguard arrangements for NDIS participants through the measures contained in this bill, and I note the strengthening of banning order provisions were also the subject of a recommendation by the independent review conducted on behalf of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020 will expand the powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to ban unsuitable providers and workers from working with NDIS participants, regardless of whether they are active in this sector or not. The NDIS commissioner, who is responsible for regulating NDIS providers and enforcing the NDIS code of conduct, will be granted additional banning orders to prevent people entering or re-entering the NDIS who may pose a risk of harm to participants. Therefore, the NDIS commissioner will be able to apply banning orders to people even if they are not currently working in the NDIS. The amendments also mean the NDIS commissioner can use information from sources outside of the NDIS such as a person's conduct in aged-care or childcare work to ban an unsuitable person from entering the NDIS in the first place. This means workers who have left the NDIS, including those who have been fired for unsuitable behaviour, can be banned from re-entering the field, and this is a very good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission will also make details to providers and workers who have been banned publicly available in the NDIS provider register. Importantly, people with disability, their families and their providers can use the register to check that people they are engaging to deliver NDIS services have not had a banning order against them. This measure will provide some comfort to those who are dependent upon the care of others for their day-to-day needs; however, I again stress, and I believe, that much more needs to be done to ensure that vulnerable NDIS recipients are protected, and that unscrupulous providers are called to account in a very timely manner. I thank the House.</span>

                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  In my contribution to this debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020 I want to highlight some of the matters that were raised by the independent review of this matter by Alan Robertson SC. But, before I do, I preface my remarks by noting that the NDIS was a Labor government initiative. In fact, it was back in 2011 that the concept evolved in this parliament. By the time the legislation passed this parliament in 2013, it was the year of an election, and, ultimately, the actual implementation of the NDIS rested with the coalition government that was elected at the time and that continues in office to this day. I understand the NDIS today supports about 400,000 Australians, 35,000 of whom are in our state of South Australia, Deputy Speaker Georganas. It is a concept that, at the time, was reluctantly supported by the coalition opposition. That reluctance seems to have permeated the implementation of the scheme once they came to office. Therefore, I'm not entirely surprised that the scheme has been very poorly rolled out under this coalition government. Indeed, some have referred to it as being a sham in terms of the way it has been implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are comments that I cannot disagree with, because in my own electorate I have seen time and time againâ€”and I might come back to thatâ€”the problems experienced on a regular basis by the people out there in the community who want to be part of the scheme and get supported by it. We see long delays; confusion; inconsistencies in the services being provided; a very complicated process which people often simply do not have the ability to deal with; and rorting of the scheme, which I suspect is much more prevalent than we might understand right here and now. Also, there is questionable delivery of services, where quite often too much of the money that is allocated goes to the service deliverer rather than the recipient of the service. Indeed, many recipients appear to get very poor value for the dollars that the government is expending on their behalf. That is one of the concerns that I have detected time and time again when I speak to people who are beneficiaries of the NDIS here in Australia. We saw all of that manifest itself in the $4.6 billion underspend in the scheme by this governmentâ€”$4.6 billion that I suspect was underspent in order to allow the Treasurer to claim that he had gotten the budget back into balance. But the reality is that the balancing of the budget came at the expense of a lot of vulnerable people in this country who needed the services they had applied for and either didn't get them or had to wait a long time for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office frequently deals with issues on behalf of families, and on many occasions it has been my office that has had to sit down with all of the different parties and pull them together in order to work through all the difficulties that were being experienced and come to a plan that was agreed to by all the parties. That isn't a role that my officeâ€”or the offices of other MPs in this placeâ€”should be doing. Nevertheless, that's how difficult it had become. That in itself highlights the failings in the very implementation of the scheme by the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing more clearly highlights the failings of this government than the tragic death on 6 April this year of Ann-Marie Smith, a death that both shocked and angered the Australian people. As a South Australian, I can tell you that, from listening to talkback radio and reading the local daily newspaper, the anger in respect of the death of Ann-Marie Smith was incredibly widespread. People saw the circumstances surrounding her death as inexcusable. We've heard about the septic shock, the multiple organ failure, the severe pressure sores and the malnutrition of a person already afflicted by cerebral palsy, who, it appears from all the evidence I've been able to read, was left in a cane chair with no visitors for months on end, other than the carer who was entrusted with her care. I found nothing to suggest that any other person had visited her during the almost two years that she was under NDIS care. Where was the comprehensive care plan? Where was the oversight of her care? Where was the medical care that she needed? How could a society and a government funded program fail her so badly?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the questions that the public and the community I represent continuously ask. Those questions resulted in three or maybe four inquiriesâ€”I believe the South Australian coroner might be conducting an inquiry into the matter as well. They resulted, through the federal government inquiry, in the Robertson report. The South Australian government had a task force review of the matter, and there's a South Australian police investigation underway. All of those investigations were in response to trying to answer those very questions that were raised when the death occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The death of Ann-Marie Smith was avoidable. It was the result of no oversight of a poorly administered scheme, which this coalition government now, belatedly, attempts to rectify through this inadequate legislation. The neglect of Ann-Marie Smith is symptomatic of the neglect of older Australians in aged care, exposed time and again, most pointedly by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. We have seen neglect of vulnerable people in publicly funded careâ€”people who are out of sight and out of mindâ€”time and time again through numerous inquiries, both in the aged-care sector and in the disability sector, and there is a royal commission into disability right now as well. I expect the findings of that commission to be equally as abhorrent as those we have already seen with the interim reports and recommendations of the royal commission into aged care. I note that both Alan Robertson and the royal commission into aged care have used the word 'neglect' in their reports, a word that I believe is starting to sink in to the minds of people who have responsibility for looking after these very people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Older people are not part of the NDIS, simply because of their age, but the reality is that many of them are just as vulnerable as Ann-Marie Smith was. In the aged-care sector, almost half of the people suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's disease, and that effectively means that they are incapable of caring for themselves. They, too, would be on the NDIS were it not for their age. So it is people like that that we should also be incredibly concerned about. Only last week I was contacted by a constituent in my electorate. In the midst of the royal commission into aged care, when there is sufficient publicity about the poor care being received by so many older Australians, I was still receiving concerns from residents about the care that their loved ones were getting in facilities in my part of Adelaide. It's almost unfathomable that, even with all the publicity, people are still being neglected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Robertson, in his report, made 10 recommendations. His report was non-statutoryâ€”that is, he had no power to compel anyone to produce documents or to answer questionsâ€”but nevertheless he came up with 10 recommendations. I won't read them in full, but I want to outline the 10 recommendations for the benefit of anyone who is following this debate, which are:</span>

                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(6) The statutory definition of "reportable incident" in s 73Z of the NDIS Act should be amended to make it clear that it includes a real or immediate threat of one of the listed types of harm â€¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to recommendation 4, I note that the community visitor scheme was not in operation in South Australia at the time because the scheme applied only to government institutions or people in private institutions. It didn't apply to people living in their own homes, as Ann-Marie Smith did. That is a matter that I believe needs to be immediately rectified because, had that scheme been in place, there would have been someone other than the carer calling in and checking on Ann-Marie on a more regular basis, and I suspect the end result would have been very, very different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, my question to the government and to the minister is simple. There are 10 recommendations and there are many other comments in Mr Robertson's report. Why is the government not implementing all of those 10 recommendations? I note that, in the minister's response to that report, there was no commitment to do so. Those recommendations all need to be followed up and should all be part of this legislation or, at least, future legislation, and we should get a commitment from the government that that will be the case. You don't have an inquiry into a matter if you're not prepared to accept the recommendations. In my view, they are all quite reasonable and proper recommendations that would prevent a similar occurrence in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude with these comments. The NDIS was a new scheme and there was always an expectation that there would be some initial implementation problems. I don't believe anybody would ever have expected that it would sail through absolutely smoothly. But, after seven years in office, the coalition government have clearly mismanaged the scheme. They have had seven years to rectify the problems, to roll it out, to implement the changes that were needed and to listen to the feedback that I have been getting for years now about the problems that exist that still have not been rectified, which I'm sure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, have been getting, along with all the other members of this House. They've had plenty of time to do so. Sadly, what's happened is that we've seen the issue come to a head only because of the death of Ann-Marie Smith. As I said earlier on, there is no excuse for Ann-Marie's death or for the failures and problems that continue under this government's oversight of the NDIS.</span>

This bill aims to protect people with disability and to prevent people with disability from experiencing harm from service provision and the people who work closely with them. As an independent national regulator with integrated functions, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, the NDIS commission, plays a key role in building confidence in the NDIS through its regulatory and compliance functions. It is, therefore, important that the NDIS commission has robust investigation and regulatory powers, and can take strong action where serious matters arise that affect the safety of NDIS participants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 June 2020, 17,253 NDIS providers were registered with the NDIS commission. Of those registered, 45 per cent were individuals or sole traders. Although the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, the NDIS Act, already empowers the NDIS commissioner to make banning orders, it has become apparent that the provisions under which these banning orders can be issued are too narrow. In short, this bill will strengthen the banning provisions of the NDIS Act and allow the NDIS commissioner to ban a worker or provider they believe is unfit to deliver NDIS services, even if they are no longer delivering NDIS services. It will also enable a banning order to be issued pre-emptively to prevent a worker or provider who is not yet working in the NDIS sector from doing so in the future based on information from another sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also make it clear the NDIS commissioner must use the existing NDIS provider register to include details of any current banning orders. This information will generally be publicly available, and people with disability and their representatives may search the NDIS provider register to ensure that providers or workers they are using are not subject to a banning order. The strengthened banning order provisions support the aim of ensuring unsuitable people who should not be delivering services under the NDIS cannot do so. This is an important part of developing trust in the NDIS market. Our paramount consideration is the right of people with disability to live lives free from abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation. We need to close these gaps in the banning order provisions, and the bill before us will do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their consideration. As requested by the committee, an addendum to the explanatory memorandum has been tabled to provide further clarification on the exercise of the banning order power. Once again, I thank all members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our ports and our airports provide the lifeblood of our country. Australia could not have got through or be getting through this global crisis without them. Throughout this crisis port workers have been hard at it: keeping our trade moving; importing the goods that we all rely on, including medical devices; exporting to the world; and ensuring that our shelves remain stocked with imported medicines and other essentials. And our airports have been at the front line in getting Australians home from overseas, getting key medical staff to where they are needed and reuniting Australians who've been separated from loved ones. Of course, with ports and airports playing such an important role in our nation, it is absolutely essential that they are secure. Like everyone in this House, Labor is committed to ensuring that our ports and airports are secure from criminal organisations and those who seek to do our nation harm. Our record in government attests to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aviation Security Identification Card, or the ASIC, and the Maritime Security Identification Card, or the MSIC, are an important part of securing the aviation, maritime and offshore oil and gas sectors from acts of terrorism and unlawful interference. The vast majority of Australian port workers do a great job. But, just as in every workforce, there will always be a small minority who will put their own interests ahead of the greater good and ahead of the law. Those who use our aviation and maritime transport systems as means to distribute drugs and other contraband into, out of and within Australian commit crimes. We know it happens, and Labor will of course support sensible measures to minimise this trade, to detect the perpetrators and to bring them to justice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But unfortunately this bill is not fit for purpose, and in some parts it's frankly not even sensible or workable. A quarter of a million Australian workers currently hold an ASIC or an MSIC. These Australians deserve a system that treats them with respect and allows them to do their jobs while also protecting our national security. And to protect our national security it must apply to everyone working in our ports, including foreign workers. However, we already know that the ASIC and MSIC system is plagued with bureaucratic bungling and, frankly, delays as people try to get or renew their passes. Too often workers can't attend work because their cards have not been completed on time by the Department of Home Affairs contractors. This is not because of any poor paperwork or missed deadlines by these hardworking Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the case of Brendan, a seafarer, whose only conviction is that he got into a fight in a pub 31 years ago, yet every time he needs to renew his MSIC he faces up to a 90-day wait, never sure whether his card will arrive on time for his next shift. This is his livelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government now seeks to expand this failing system without first fixing the problems that exist within it at the moment. When we take a look at the legislation itself, we see that this bill, which is about serious crime, lacks an important detail. Incredibly, this bill contains no definition of 'serious crime'. How can this bill be about serious crime when it doesn't even define, for the purposes of this bill, what serious crime actually is? There are at least 12 different definitions of 'serious crime' in different Commonwealth acts and regulations. This bill provides no detail about which definition will apply in this case. The bill is about people's livelihoodsâ€”their careers, their ability to go to workâ€”so it absolutely deserves clarity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next we find that the bill imposes stricter conditions on Australian workers in Australian ports than it does on foreign crews working on our shores. With more and more foreign ships with foreign crews plying our coastline under licences issued by this government, how is the government screening these foreign crew members? Under this government's watch, we are now in a situation where less than half of one per cent of our seaborne trade is carried by Australian ships. That percentage is rapidly heading towards zero. Under this government's watch, the number of Australian flagged vessels has fallen to barely being in the double digits. For six years the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has stood by, when they should have been supporting and building our shipping industry. The government's own bureaucrats have pointed out the risks in relation to foreign crew working in Australia. But, rather than addressing these concerns in this bill, the government has chosen to target only Australian workers with ill-defined laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Department of Immigration and Border Protection could not have been clearer in 2017 when it said that foreign vessels and their crews, which use flag-of-convenience registration to operate in Australia, are likely targets for organised crime syndicates and terrorists. The department said that the reduced transparency and secrecy surrounding the complex financial and ownership arrangements of these vessels make them and their crews attractive for use in illegal activity, including by organised crime or terrorist groups. The department went on to say that these ships may be used in a range of illegal activities, including illegal exploitation of natural resources, illegal activity in protected areas, people smuggling and facilitating prohibited imports or exports. You'd think that this would be something that the government would follow up, but, no, they've done nothing to ensure that these workers are subject to any robust background checking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have, in effect, one set of tough rules for Australians, which are about to get tougher through this legislation, and next to no background checks for foreign workers. How is that fair? How does that protect our borders and protect our national security? Labor does support measures to stop serious crime, but serious crime deserves serious responses, and this legislation needs improvement before Labor can support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To improve this bill, I will be moving amendments to define 'serious crime' to ensure the scope of crimes covered under this legislation is targeted and is not so unfairly broad that a range of workers are unnecessarily disqualified from the maritime and aviation industry, when they do not present a specific security threat. I will also move amendments to ensure that there is a legislative avenue of appeal for those who've been determined to have an adverse security status. People deserve to know why they cannot get to do their job. I will also move amendments to mandate processing times for ASIC and MSIC cards. This is a system that, as I said, has been plagued by delay, and it absolutely needs to be improved. I will also move amendments to take steps to ensure that foreign crew members are subject to similar background checking to Australian workers. The opposition will also ensure that workers cannot be denied access to an ASIC or MSIC on the basis of intelligence only. The legislation must not be a backdoor way for the government to remove aviation or waterside workers' rights to work, and they must make commitments to that effect. They've told us that that's the case, but we want to make absolutely sure that that is very clear and very explicit within this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that has been much more interested in getting a headline than actually delivering and helping people. And, of course, this bill comes from a government which has repeatedly failed when it comes to our borders. On 15 March, the Prime Minister said, 'The Australian government will also ban cruise ships from foreign ports arriving in Australian ports.' Four days later, at 6.30 am on 19 March, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> was allowed to disembark in Sydney, with 2,700 passengers, including sick passengers, allowed to spread COVID-19 across Australia and across the globe. When it comes to the borders, the buck stops with the Commonwealth, and, on that matter, they resoundingly failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, while the government let passengers with COVID spread across the country, they still have no plan to assist stranded Australians across the world. The Prime Minister made the announcement about further travel restrictions and caps on international arrivals but didn't have a plan for what would happen next, and he doesn't care, frankly, for those many Australians who are left overseas. Members of parliament are being inundated with pleas for help from Australians stranded overseas, and the Prime Minister needs to come up with a realistic, sustainable plan to help them now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are hearing stories, of course, of Australians separated from their families, forced to live in caravans, drawing down on their superannuation or missing the funerals of loved ones because the government doesn't have a plan. This is a government that has failed on its borders. There are 27,000 Australians who want to return home but can't because the Morrison government won't assist. We know that the Commonwealth does have capacity here and there is plenty they could be doing. Australians are sick of a government which sees protecting our borders as nothing more than cheap headlines but doesn't care for Australians overseas and doesn't care for our maritime and aviation workers.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  I rise in support of the Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2019. I was looking forward to speaking in the chamber today and listening to the honourable member's contribution about how Labor would support this bill. But, unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case, at least in its current form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2019 amends the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to address criminal activity at Australia's borders. The bill does this by changing the eligibility criteria under the aviation and maritime security identification card schemes, the ASIC and MSIC schemes, to exclude persons with a serious criminal history or with known links to organised crime. At present, the background check for ASIC and MSIC cardholders establishes whether an applicant poses a security threat but does not consider if the individual may pose a criminal threat. This bill will address that shortcoming. The bill has been reviewed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which recommended that the bill be passed with an amendment to allow applications to be refused on the basis of an adverse criminal intelligence assessment. An amendment to the bill has been developed to implement this recommendation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ballarat talked about there not being a sufficient definition in the bill of what a serious crime is. Providing a definition of a serious crime in the bill, in my respectful submission, could inadvertently lead to serious offences not being captured in the regulations. Regulations made under the new powers being inserted by the bill will indicate categories of offences that are considered to be serious crimes. By specifically outlining categories of offences that are considered serious in relation to Australia's transport system, it ensures that we accurately capture offences most related to aviation, maritime and offshore facility security. Under this definition, serious criminal activity includes the sexual exploitation and abuse of children with lifelong impact on victims and families. It includes illicit drugs on our streets destroying lives and communities. It includes the money-laundering operations destroying our financial markets, the black market firearm shipments fuelling violence, and cybertheft of personal information and online investment scams, which constantly prey on Australian citizens day after day. These activities cause enormous human suffering in Australia, and the measures introduced in this bill will strengthen Australia's ability to combat serious crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Serious crime is a major threat to the Australian way of life and, as I suggested a moment ago, it causes enormous human suffering. Serious and organised criminals control illicit markets that can serve to fund a broad range of criminal activities, including terrorism. Organised criminals are gaining a major source of revenue from this illicit drug market. We need to ensure that our airports and our seaports are not safe havens for serious criminal activity. The Australian Institute of Criminology has estimated the cost of serious and organised crime in 2016-17 to be between $23.8 billion and $47.4 billionâ€”huge sums of money at a huge cost to the Australian community. As sure as night follows day, this cost will continue to rise and it is imperative that the government puts in place measures to prevent serious crime, for the safety and security of all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIC and MSIC schemes have been very effective in protecting Australian airports and seaports from terrorism. However, they are vulnerable to exploitation by serious crime groups. Securing our airports and seaports against infiltration from organised crime is vital in protecting legitimate industries and the Australian community. Airports and seaports are commonly used as entrance points to Australia for illicit goods and for transporting such goods around Australia. Criminals engage in illicit activities to maximise their profits, much to the detriment of all Australians, in areas such as illicit drugs, violence, money laundering, cybercrime, and, importantly, child exploitation. Protecting Australians and our nation's interests from these threats is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The holders of these ASIC and MSIC are trusted individuals, and with that trust comes obligations. Trusted insiders may be any person who can use their knowledge and access to exploit vulnerabilities within an aviation or a maritime facility. The intelligence community has confirmed that trusted insiders remain a significant risk to the aviation and maritime transport sectors. Let me say that again: the intelligence community has confirmed that trusted insiders remain a significant risk to the aviation and maritime transport sectors. Based on intelligence from December 2019, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission has identified approximately 227 ASIC or MSIC holders currently recorded on the crime commission's National Criminal Target List. That's 227 existing ASIC or MSIC holders. The individuals recorded in the crime commission's criminal intelligence holdings have been identified as posing a significant threat to the security of Australia's borders. This demonstrates the importance in addressing the vulnerabilities in these schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expanded purpose of this bill will provide for greater safeguards to ensure that ASIC and MSICs are not inappropriately used to facilitate and perpetrate serious crime in security-controlled airports and seaports. The purpose of schedule 1 to this bill is very clear. Schedule 1 to the bill will introduce a new purpose for both the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to prevent the use of security-controlled airports, seaports and offshore facilities in connection with serious crime. This additional purpose will complement the aviation and maritime security identification card schemes' current purpose of preventing unlawful interference. Schedule 1 will provide for regulations to be made to introduce new ASIC and MSIC eligibility criteria, targeting serious criminal offences and prescribing penalties for offences against the regulations for up to 200 penalty units. This means that penalties relating to the serious crime purpose will align with those relating to the unlawful interference purpose. Schedule 1 will also take care of a number of administrative issues and make some technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new purpose for the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, to be inserted by schedule 1 to the bill, will provide greater safeguards to ensure that ASICs and MSICs are not inappropriately used to facilitate and perpetrate serious crimes at our airports and seaports. But one has to ask the question as to why people who are involved in or have serious criminal convictions or have links to organised crime have access to the most secure areas of our airports and seaports. Surely, in these most critical pieces of infrastructure, we have to maintain a high level of security. That is a priority for the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The limited scope of the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act has enabled people who have serious criminal convictions or links to organised crime and are not considered to pose a security threat to be classified as eligible holders of ASICs and MSICs. This bill will provide greater security outcomes for Australians by ensuring that people with serious criminal convictions or links to organised crime are not able to access secure areas of our airports and seaports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my closing four minutes, I want to give the House some case examples of what has gone on in the past. In a matter in 1997, the applicant was convicted of offences of cultivating and trafficking cannabis. For these offences, the applicant was ordered to pay compensation and to perform unpaid community work and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, which was wholly suspended. Some nine years later, the applicant was convicted of two offences: firstly, aid, abet, counsel or procure the importation of a prohibited import, which was cocaine; and, secondly, attempt to possess prohibited imports, which was also cocaine. On the first count, the applicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment, and, on the second count, the applicant was sentenced to five years imprisonment. The applicant was released from prison in 2010. Just three years later the applicant applied to CASA for the issue of an aviation security identification card, the ASIC. CASA rightly refused to issue an ASIC due to the applicant's adverse criminal record. The applicant then applied to the department for a discretionary review. The department knocked him back, due to the nature of the applicant's offences. The matter went to the AAT, and the AAT gave this individual an ASIC, subject to certain conditions. In setting aside the decision to refuse the ASIC, the AAT stated that it must take into account the purpose of the Aviation Transport Security Act, as well as the discretion allowable by the Aviation Transport Security Regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current framework restricts determinations made with regard to ASICs to purely security risks and not criminal risks. Here's a person who was convicted of three serious offences, served considerable time and, three years later, applied for an ASIC, got knocked back by CASA and knocked back by the department, and the AAT approved it, subject to certain conditions. This bill will ensure that people who have been convicted of those sorts of serious criminal offences will not be entitled to hold important security vetting into our airports and our seaports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the second case. In 1991, the applicant was placed on a good behaviour bond after being convicted of cultivating a cannabis plant. In 2007, some years later, the applicant was convicted of trafficking a commercial quantityâ€”40.3 kilogramsâ€”of cannabis. The applicant was ordered to pay a fine and was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. The applicant was also convicted of possessing an unregistered firearm. In 2011, four years later, the applicant applied to ClientView for a maritime security card and he was refused. He applied for a discretionary review and that was refused. He went to the AAT and, lo and behold, he was given an MSIC, subject to certain conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly the legislation in its current form is not fit for purpose. The amendments in this bill will ensure that the wrong people are not in the right places, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

I'd like to pick up on the amendment moved by the member for Ballarat where she asks how we define what is a 'serious crime'â€”and of course, by implication, what is not a 'serious crime'. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record for this House that it is not a serious crime in this country for a pregnant woman to post something on Facebook protesting a government policy. That is not a serious crime. It is also not a serious crime for a mother to take her children to the beach on a hot afternoon. That is not a serious crime. It is not a serious crime in this country for a grandmother to sit on a park bench in the sun. It is not a serious crime for people to go to Queen Victoria Markets on the weekend to purchase a few fruit and vegetables. It is not a serious crime in this country to hold a protest sign that says 'Casualties of corona: common sense, freedom of speech, human rights and democracy'. And it is not a serious crime in this country for an elderly lady to hold up a sign that merely says 'Open the churches'. These are not serious crimes and they should never be considered serious crimes in any country, let alone our great Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is a serious crime? We know that one of the serious crimes that are proliferating during lockdowns is child sexual abuse. We've heard from the Australian Federal Police that the lockdowns provide 'a rich environment' for paedophiles to operate, and they said there had been almost a 100 per cent increase in that online activity during COVID-19. I wonder, if those numbers were run through a great supercomputer, if it could see what damage is being done. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also put it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that a 'serious crime' could also be a breach of article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, through the denial of medicine and medical treatment. It says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also say it is a serious crime to be in breach of article 12 of the 1966 International Covenant On Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This specifically applies, and I'll read the relevant sections. It says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the bill, the minister has clearly set out what a 'serious crime' is. Serious crimes are costing the Australian economy $47 billion per annum. Our airports and our seaports are the transportation points where organised criminals import weapons, illicit drugs and other harmful goods into Australia. Trafficking in illicit drugs puts Australia's security, our prosperity, our welfare and our communities at great risk. </span>

The House should not wait another moment. I commend the bill to this House and I hope it is quickly passed by this House.</span>

The bill, as we know, is evidence of the government's commitment to ensuring that Australia's aviation and maritime systems are safe and secure. A number of inquiries and reports have noted that individuals and organised crime groups are exploiting weaknesses in the aviation and maritime security identification card schemesâ€”the ASIC and MSIC schemesâ€”enabling them to conduct serious criminal activity at our airports and seaports, such as the importation of illegal weapons and drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Serious and organised crime causes enormous human suffering in the Australian community. For example, in 2018 alone there were 438 drug induced deaths that involved heroin and a further 407 drug induced deaths that involved amphetamines. The suffering inflicted on the families of these 845 Australians and visitors to Australia from just two of the many illicit drugs imported into Australia by criminal cartels is immeasurable. Serious and organised crime also imposes significant costs on our economy. The Australian Institute of Criminology has estimated that organised crime costs the Australian economy more than $47 billion per annum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced this bill in order to address serious criminal influence at airports and seaports. The airports and seaports are gateways for the entry of illicit goods into Australia and it is essential that persons granted access to sensitive and secure areas in Australia's international ports of entry are of sound character. The bill establishes a regulatory framework to achieve this outcome. The reforms in this bill will impact persons involved in serious and organised crime, by allowing applicants for an ASIC or MSIC to have their application refused if they have a serious and relevant criminal history. A less serious or irrelevant offending history will not preclude a person from obtaining an ASIC or MSIC.</span>

The committee's report on the bill made two recommendations. Specifically, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to incorporate a criminal intelligence assessment in the application process of the ASIC and MSIC schemes. The committee recommended that, subject to this recommendation being implemented, the bill be passed. The committee was of the view that our:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ aviation and maritime environments remain vulnerable to infiltration and exploitation by persons with links to serious and organised crime.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of a criminal intelligence assessment in the background check process for the ASIC and MSIC schemes would strengthen the schemes by enabling decisions to exclude persons who have links to serious crime, where that person might facilitate or commit crime, from accessing airports and seaports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports the committee's recommendation, and I'll be moving amendments to this bill in order to implement the committee's recommendation to include criminal intelligence assessments as part of the background check process for ASICs and MSICs. The amendments will establish the regulatory framework to ensure that people with known links to serious and organised crime groups will be ineligible to hold ASICs or MSICs. The amendments will provide the ACIC with the ability to conduct these assessments, as well as providing for merits review of adverse criminal intelligence assessments. The purpose of the bill and the amendments is to ensure that ASICs and MSICs are not issued to individuals who pose a security or serious criminal risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill gives effect to the government's election commitment to strengthen background-checking regimes in order to ensure that individuals with links to serious crime cannot gain access to our airports or seaports. It will reduce the ability of serious and organised crime groups to engage in illegal activities and, in turn, keep illegal drugs and guns off our streets and our communities safe.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting our ports and airports is a very serious issue. We do take that matter very seriously. I think that was demonstrated by our actions in government as well. These Labor amendments will make the Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2019 better, protecting our nation's security at the same time as facilitating Australia's essential workers. It's important that our ports and our workers are still able to operate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Labor senators identified in their report to the Senate, this bill fails to define 'serious crime' and instead relies on delegated legislation with minimal parliamentary oversight. Labor welcomes the government's indication that they plan to include in the regulations a tiered scheme of crimes in an attempt to get the balance right between protecting our national security and not wrongly excluding a worker from their work. Without having seen those regulations, it is very difficult to determine whether they do in fact do what we think they should do. Labor has repeatedly asked the government to define 'serious crime' and to introduce a definition into the legislation, but the government has consistently said that it won't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While not seeking to prevent the government from introducing their proposed tiered scheme, Labor seeks to amend this legislation to ensure that minor crimes are not included in the regulations by the government. The amendments will define 'serious crime' as a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least three years, which is consistent with the definition of 'serious crime' in the citizenship cessation bill currently before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will also amend the legislation to include processing time frames for ASICs and MSICs and a legislated avenue of appeal for the hardworking men and women of our ports and airports who have kept this country going. Every time they apply for an ASIC or MSIC or seek to renew their cards they are constantly worried that they will be rejected or that they will be left waiting for their card to be issued. A quarter of a million Australian workers currently hold an ASIC or MSIC. These Australians deserve a system that treats them with respect and allows them to do their job while also protecting our national security. Too often Australian workers at our ports can't go to work because of long processing delays with their cards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposed expansion of ASICs and MSICs is symptomatic of a government that has not fully understood or taken responsibility for those long processing delays and the impact that that has on the hardworking men and women at our Australian ports and airports who have done nothing wrong. This is why Labor will amend the legislation to ensure that the obligatory processing time frame of 60 days is strictly adhered to by the government when issuing an ASIC or MSIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, Labor will ensure that there is a legislative avenue of appeal for those who have been determined to have an adverse security status. People deserve to know why they cannot get that job. Workers' rights have been consistently undercut by this government, and moving the right to appeal from regulations to legislation is recommended by the respected Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and of course is the right thing to do for those hardworking Australian men and women. As I said, these amendments I've moved will improve the bill and, we think, get the balance right between ensuring that we treat the issue of serious crime seriously in this bill and ensure that our ports and airports are secure, and making sure that we are not putting unnecessary impediments in the way of those hardworking men and women at our Australian ports and airports who have kept this country moving. They have done nothing wrong and are subject to delays or, in fact, because there's not a definition of 'serious crime' contained in this bill, are punished in a way that, frankly, is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut on some occasions.</span>

Under the government's amendments, workers will lose their right to work on the basis of intelligence rather than of conviction. This is exactly the issue that we've raisedâ€”why there's no definition of 'serious crime' in this bill. But now the government's in fact expanding that. So, rather than a conviction, it will be based on intelligence, which will see applicants denied natural justice, with their employment put at stake by what could be baseless accusations and with limited grounds of appeal. Let's be clear that this could mean that a worker could be denied entry into their workplace based on a rumour alone. A worker could lose their job based on some gossip. A worker could lose their livelihood based on a colleague lying about them to get even at their workplace. Is this really what the Prime Minister means when he says that they're for workers, when their jobs could be snatched away by rumour, gossip and innuendo? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  The Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020 sets out the proposed framework or structure for the newly established executive agency, Services Australia, to replace the now abolished Department of Human Services. It proposes a number of changes that aim to both update terminology and streamline the reporting lines associated with transitioning DHS to Services Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports modifications to governance structures across the public sector that lead to improved outcomes for employees and the Australians that rely on them. But there is a problem while there is a cap. Leaving aside for the moment the renegade scheme of robodebt, the bill fails to address the biggest issue at the centre of Services Australiaâ€”the arbitrary staffing cap imposed across the public sector which has led to an overreliance on labour hire agencies to keep up with demand, as well as exorbitant overspend on outsourcing and consultants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Staff at Services Australia have been faced with a remarkable workload in recent times, from dealing with the bushfire response in January to managing the surge in new applications for JobSeeker allowance that arose throughout March and April. The staffing cap was placed across the public sector in 2013 without weighing up the capabilities or requirements of each agency or department, either at the time that it was introduced or looking into the future. Doing away with the arbitrary quota would allow the newly established executive agency to recruit the appropriate number of staff to provide the COVID-19 pandemic response without needing to rely so heavily on labour hire and external consultants. The reality is the average staffing level is a staffing cap. It is not only a reduction in the real staffing numbers as the population grows but also a privatisation policy by stealth. It has the inevitable result that agencies trying to do their work and trying discharge their public duties are forced to outsource and rely on contracting out. Lacking in-house resources, they instead spend exorbitant amounts on consultants and engage labour hire contractors to staff to departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does a rigid staff cap save money? No, of course it doesn't. All it does is hollow out the expertise and experience of the public sector by getting rid of salaried employees and replacing them with labour hire casuals through third-party corporations. A staffing cap is by nature inflexible. It relies on nothing changing. What happens when in an emergency like a viral pandemic, for example, you need to hire more people? Does the government save money then? No. They just hire more people as labour hire casuals instead of retaining existing employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this with the government's announcement on 22 March to engage 6,500 additional workers to help with the surge in demand on Services Australia. It did not escape our attention that this is a similar numberâ€”a very similar numberâ€”to what the government had cut from the front line over the past seven years. This is not responsible planning. This is not a responsible government. Are these 6,500 personnel who've been brought on given a career path? Are they given job security? No. Like all the others snuck in through the back door of labour hire or through 'service delivery partners'â€”that dreaded Tory euphemismâ€”these workers are brought in and, just when they start to get a good handle on the job, to develop a bit of expertise and to be able to help the Australians they're there to support, they're booted out. What have the extra 6,500 workers done during this pandemic response? Well, approximately 1.3 million new claims were processed for JobSeeker in 55 days. That's the same number of applications that would normally be processed across a 2Â½ year period. At the peak, more than 53,000 claims were completed in a single dayâ€”in one day. Just think about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if the government, in a time of dangerously low employment, gave these 6,500 people secure employment. Imagine what might happen to the level of customer service that people experience when they contact Services Australia. There'd be no more phones ringing out, no more frustrating automation and no more robotic programs, just real problem-solving human beings helping out the public. I will return to the issue of the staff cap, but, for the moment, let me say that we need to revive the Public Service. The Public Service needs to be properly funded, and we need to provide some security so it can work in the interests of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Australian public needs is a substantial changeâ€”that is, material change, not rebrands or marketing pictures. Will this bill be able to change the dominant culture of Services Australiaâ€”that is, the culture that allowed robodebt to happen? Without Labor's work, without the work of the member for Maribyrnong in particular, the government would still be issuing innocent Australians with robodebt notices, with the tragic consequences we've all seen in our communities. Since taking on the shadow government services portfolio, the member for Maribyrnong has spoken much in the last 14 months, inside and outside the House, about robodebt. He has spoken of his concerns about its cruelty, inaccuracy and unreliability and his belief that it was an illegal scheme. Given the growing number of victims the government was ignoring, the member for Maribyrnong believed the only way they could get justice and have their voices properly heard was through a class action. This government and the department and agencies involved had to be dragged to any admission that there was anything wrong with robodebt or that the victims of robodebt, those countless people across Australia, required anything like fair treatment or a sympathetic ear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Robodebt has been nothing less than a fraud perpetrated by this government on some of the most vulnerable people of this country. And we should never forget that the worst scandal in the history of social welfare in this country went all the way to the top of the government's political hierarchy. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, started robodebt when he was social services minister. He expanded it when he was the Treasurer and has done nothing but whitewash it as the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, now that they've been caught out red-handed, will only say that he has deep regrets. It is better than nothing, but true remorse would be followed by action to remedy and the ruling out of a robodebt reboot. Minister Stuart Robert has claimed he can't be responsible because he's only been the minister for the last 15 months. Others will remember that he was human services minister in 2015-16, overseeing a key stage of the robodebt rollouts before he resigned from the Turnbull ministry. The bright new sign out the front may say 'Services Australia', but has the dominant culture changed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like now to share two of the many examples of people in my local community who haven't got the support they deserve from Services Australia. The first is Jennifer from Berkeley Vale. Jennifer is 66 years old. After being injured at work, she was forced to retire earlier than she wanted to. Jennifer had to wait five months to find out whether she would receive the age pension. What was Jennifer expected to live on, as her savings disappeared? The department revealed at Senate estimates that in 2017-18 nearly half of the applications for age pensions were not processed within the target of 49 days. We can argue about whether or not that is a reasonable target, and I don't think it is, but more than half were not processed within that target. And, alarmingly, waiting times were longer for both disability support pensions and carer payments. In the middle of this pandemicâ€”noting that it's National Carers Week next weekâ€”we know the number of unpaid carers who have experienced increased demands during COVID, when formal support or paid support has fallen away. They've had to school their children from home, and they've had to pick up the gap in the mismanagement of the NDIS. We know how hard it is for carers at the moment. That they would have to wait more than 49 days for a carer payment to be processed is just not good enough. The department advises people to apply for pensions 13 weeks ahead. But, like Jennifer's, people's circumstances can change quickly, particularly in a global pandemic, leaving them in desperate need of support, especially in a crisis like the one we're living through at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't genuinely aim to improve Services Australia while the pain and injustice of robodebt persists. Robodebt is a shameful episode in the history of this government. Billions of dollars were unlawfully taken from innocent Australians, while the government used the money to prop up a so-called budget surplus. This has hurt people in my community, people like Veronica. Veronica is a single parent from Killarney Vale in my electorate. In 2015, she was hit with a $5,000 robodebt from Centrelink. Veronica and her children faced eviction from their home. When the government issues you with a legal demand, when the government says, 'You owe us money,' some people are afraid. They're terrified, and they just pay up. Others just can't afford to foot the bill. These are the real human consequences of the government's unlawful actions that are affecting people across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, it took the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Australians getting their day in court to force this government reluctantly to announce a plan to repay victims of robodebt. With over 60,000 direct applicants and up to 734,000 group members, the robodebt class action is the biggest in Australian legal history. This government has been forced to do the right thing by the Australians they have ripped off, by the Australians they have traumatised. For months the robodebt minister, Stuart Robert, denied the scheme was unfair, inaccurate or illegal. And when he put the emergency brakes on the scheme, he said it was only a refinementâ€”a refinement!â€”affecting a small cohort. This dodgy scheme is more than what the government now calls legally insufficient. It has cost countless Australians their livelihoods and, tragically, in some cases their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will return now to the staffing cap. As I mentioned earlier, the staffing cap was placed across the public sector in 2013 without weighing up the capabilities or the requirements of each agency or department at the time it was introduced or looking towards the future. It is turning the Australian Public Service into consultancy land. A recently analysis by the Australian National Audit Office found the four big firmsâ€”Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PwCâ€”collectively reap $800 million a year in government contracts. Imagine if that sort of money, nearly $1 billion, was instead invested in keeping know-how, in keeping skills, in keeping that corporate memory within the Public Service instead of gutting it from within and then seeking to patch it up from the outside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has even conceded this point. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has let the cat out of the bag that the APS staff cap effectively forced agencies to use more expensive consultants and contractors. Not surprisingly, this is hurting the quality and capability of the Australian Public Service. A review of the Australian Public Service by a former Telstra chief executive found the use of external contractors and consultants to deliver work previously done in-house was cited as a key in the decline in the capability of the Australian Public Service. It's not good enough. We need to properly invest in the Public Service, we need to provide proper security to the Public Service so that those people working within it can provide the support that Australians need, particularly in a pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd now like to turn to big data or, more accurately, the government's over-reliance on technology, or the misuse of technology. The effect of this over-reliance on technology in what was the Department of Human Services is really to justify cutting permanent staff and contributes to greater economic inequality. This is something that US professor Virginia Eubanks has written about. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Massive investments in data-driven administration of public programs are rationalized by a call for efficiency, doing more with less, and getting help to those who really need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She concludes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Technologies of poverty management are not neutral.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She said that they're in fact shaped by an underlying contempt for the less well-off, for the disadvantaged, for the poor in our communities. Our bold new world of big data does have many exciting possibilities. But to avoid repeats of robodebt, we need a government that treats data with respect. Letting automation loose on data, which has no concern for human beingsâ€”it is people who are needed to make the important decisions about how data is collected, how data is monitored, how data is analysed and how data is used. This responsibility needs to be a publicly accountable responsibility. This is a weighty responsibility; it needs to be transparent and it needs to be publicly accountable. It can't just be handed over to the private sector. It's a public responsibility to look at the consequences of big data, mass automation and artificial intelligence, and the decision framework needs to go beyond profit and loss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Human services should not just become a series of contractual decisions in a free market. If outsourced, privatised and robbed of internal resources, organisations can become imbalanced and may become harmful to the common good. Power over vulnerable people is a fragile contract. It must be respected and it must be properly resourced. This is why the government must abolish its counterproductive ASL offset rule which arbitrarily caps numbers of public servants. Directly employing workers within Services Australia instead would create a stable and experienced workforce with less turnover and greater capacity to serve the needs of all Australians, so that calls to Services Australia don't go unanswered every day and so that Australians don't waste too much time on hold trying to access Centrelink services, causing avoidable distress and anxiety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2019 to 27 April 2020 there were almost 25 million busy signals and 4.3 million congested signals. If you exclude the quick income management calls, the average speed of answering a call was approximately 21 minutes. That is 21 minutes from someone dialling to be able to speak to somebody within Services Australia. Unanswered calls from the public in times of crisis are what happens when humans are taken out of human services. For all of these reasons, we urge the government to lift the cap and put actual service back at the forefront of Services Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude, I'd like to mention the Tuggerah call centre in my electorate. These past few months have been difficult for workers in the Services Australia call centre at Tuggerah. In April, one worker tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, all 208 people working at the centre were required to self-isolate for two weeks while working from home, which, as everyone would recognise, placed an enormous strain on them and their families and households. The anxiety of quarantine was heightened by lack of public information. It took three urgent letters to the Minister for Government Services to get a response. I thank the local health district for sharing relevant and timely information for those directly impacted, for their households and for those in the wider community. But, if appropriate arrangements had been in place to work from home, some 208 employees and their households, their family members, may have avoided quarantine, and the isolation and associated anxiety. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I'm pleased to rise in support of the Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020. The bill makes technical and administrative changes to legislation as a result of Services Australia having been established as an executive agency under the Public Service Act 1999 on 1 February this year. In particular, it makes direct textual amendments to legislation so that acts correctly refer to Services Australia or the Department of Social Services. It amends various secrecy provisions so that information that was held by the Services Australia or the department of human services as a department of state can continue to be protected by those secrecy provisions. It amends the Human Services (Centrelink) Act 1997 to protect the name Services Australia from unauthorised use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation is necessary to ensure clear and correct references to Services Australia or the Department of Social Services and to support decision-making by those agencies under legislation. It also seeks to ensure that the name Services Australia cannot be used inappropriatelyâ€”for example, by a business seeking to imply a connection with the Australian government. It will operate retrospectively from 1 February 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the bill is technical and administrative in nature and not one that will set the world on fireâ€”nor should it cause any concernâ€”it does relate to one of the Public Service agencies that has an impact on the lives of many Australians, sometimes whether they are aware of it or not. Services Australia is responsible for the delivery of advice and high-quality, accessible social, health and child support services and payments. It does this through Medicare, through programs such as the PBS, the Australian Immunisation Register and the Australian Organ Donor Register. It does this through Centrelink. It delivers payments and services and provides services at times of major change for all the following groups of people: seniors, jobseekers, students and trainees, families, carers, parents, people with disabilities, Indigenous Australians, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. It also oversees child support and gives separated parents the financial and emotional support needed for their children's wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The significant work and reach undertaken by Services Australia in normal times can be demonstrated through the following figures from 2018-19. In that period Social Services oversaw payments totalling $184 billion, more than $3.5 million social security and welfare claims, more than 429 million Medicare services, more than 63,500 aged-care claims and around 980 million interactions with individual Australians. While these are significant in and of themselves, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the pressure and work of Services Australia has increased dramatically. Services Australia has been at the forefront of the Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing support to millions of Australians. And in a rapidly evolving environment the like of which we have not seen in our lifetimes, Services Australia has worked closely with policy agencies to streamline processes to ensure that people who have been impacted by the pandemic receive vital support as quickly and as easily as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia centres have remained open throughout the pandemic but, to assist with the health response, Services Australia has been asking only the most vulnerable in the community to visit and has been encouraging everybody else to use the online and call service options. In order to meet the surge in demand for online and call services, Services Australia had to quickly upgrade these services and employ and train additional people to work in the call centres and payment processing. It's important to note the outcome of this work that they did. The majority of social security and welfare claims have been processed in eight daysâ€”nearly 20 days faster than last year. And calls have been answered during the COVID pandemic about 15 minutes faster than last yearâ€”and the myGov website now has the largest capacity of any authenticated online platform in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This system remains stable despite averaging up to 837,000 sign-ins daily during the peak month of June, compared with an average of 575,000 in June 2019. Since March of this year Services Australia has delivered more than $21.2 billion in additional payments and processed more than 1.7 million JobSeeker claims, providing income support to people in need. In fact, in the space of 55 days Services Australia processed 1.3 million JobSeeker claims. That's the number they would normally process in 2Â½ years. At the peak, they completed more than 53,000 claims in a single day. More than $12.4 billion in the coronavirus supplement has now been paid through Services Australia to new and existing eligible income support recipients in addition to their usual payment. More than $9 billion has been paid to seven million Australians on lower incomes, including pensioners, other social security and veteran income support recipients, and eligible concession card holders. Some $14.9 million in pandemic leave disaster payments has gone to almost 10,000 people who work in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. They have been directed to self-isolate but don't have sick leave payments through JobSeeker or JobKeeper. </span>

I would like to commend the CEO and all those who work at Services Australia for what they have managed to achieve over the last six months. They have delivered in an environment that has been and continues to be incredibly challenging for everyone. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  For the short time I have, I also rise to speak on the Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020. Labor has said that it will support this bill. I do support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, particularly in relation to those staffing caps, which have made it very difficult at Services Australia for the many functions they carry out. Those staffing caps are a false economy. They undermine the quality of government services, especially those services that are delivered by Services Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sets out the proposed framework or structure for a newly established agency. The bill seeks to retrospectively abolish the Department of Human Services and establish, in its place, Services Australia. Labor supports modifications to governance structures across the public sector that lead to improved outcomes and services, particularly those services that Australians rely on. However, what we don't agree with is this cruel Liberal-National government's attempt to impose the arbitrary staffing cap on the Public Service. We also condemn the government for their massive underfunding of Centrelink services. So many peopleâ€”our pensioners, seniors, veterans, people with disability, families, carers, people seeking work, and studentsâ€”rely on the essential frontline services that our local Centrelink provides, including Medicare services. More recently, so many more have come to rely on Centrelink services due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the Morrison recession. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes several changes that aim to both modernise the terminology associated with our social services and streamline the process associated with transitioning to Services Australia. Regrettably, this bill fails to address the fundamental, core issue at the centre of Services Australia: this arbitrary staffing cap imposed across the public sector that's led to an over-reliance on labour hire, external contractors and outsourcing to consultants. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Services Australia was already under severe strain from trying to keep up with demand. Indeed, the staff at Services Australia have managed a massive workload in recent times, from dealing with the bushfire response in January to managing the surge in new applicants for the JobSeeker allowance that has arisen from the ongoing economic crisis. Services Australia staff are there for Australians in their moments of greatest need and sometimes their greatest despair, whether it's providing financial relief to those unable to work or those needing to access counselling and social work services, or helping jobseekers find work. They do an incredibly remarkable job and I'd like to commend them for the work they have been doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months we've seen some very heartbreaking images of many people waiting in long lines outside Centrelink. These images of desperate Australians, unfortunately, may only grow. It is a devastating economic situation. The COVID-19 crisis is both a health crisis and an economic crisis, and the impact has been devastating in my regionâ€”devastating for local workers losing their jobs, especially because so many are ineligible for JobKeeper. This is one of the many issues I've raised here before. Many in my region who have been hit very hard by this crisis have been ineligible for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those on JobKeeper, we know that the Morrison government's September cuts mean that 33,000 local workers across the Richmond electorate are worse off, and more than $30 million will be ripped out of the North Coast economy every fortnight. That's 33,000 local workers on JobKeeper, and that will be cut. That's devastating for our region. Here we are in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, neck deep in the Morrison recession, with mass unemployment at historic highs, and all we're seeing is Liberal-National party cuts when it comes to those Centrelink services, and that really is devastating, particularly for regional areas. In terms of the cuts and changes to JobKeeper, they come in from Monday 28 Septemberâ€”</span>

Not only are the 2020s the critical decade to rapidly drive down pollution in a last chance to secure a safe climate; they are now shaping up to be the critical decade to prevent spiralling economic inequality too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a Green New Deal, for a debt of about $25 billion a year, we could get to 100 per cent renewable energy; have free child care, university and TAFE; lift JobSeeker above the poverty line; guarantee every young person a job; and build half a million new public-housing homes. Instead, this budget gives $99 billion a year in subsidies to corporations and up to $50 billion a year to the 'tax cuts for millionaires' package, yet it leaves us with high unemployment, high university fees and high rents. Rather than creating jobs directly through public investment, this government is shovelling cash at big corporations; into expanding coal and gas; and into poorly thought through temporary wage subsidies and unfair tax offsets. One in three big corporations in Australia already pay no tax, but a key plank of the Morrison government's plan in this budget is to lift that to two in three companies. And we're just meant to sit and hope and pray for the best? Well, no. This budget is all brown and trickle-down, and I refuse to accept it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is remarkable how little we will actually have to show for all these billions spent. It's the kind of money that could build so much for our collective future. Imagine the jobs and opportunities we would have if we spent those billions on public housing, free child care, aged care, free TAFE and university, more teachers; and on restoring our natural environment and building renewables and high-speed rail. Instead, in the worst recession in generations, we're going deeper into debt to put more money into the bank accounts of those that earn more than a million dollars a year. Millionaires will get $2Â½ thousand, the working poor get $250 and the people who have lost their job get a kick in the teeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disgusting that the Treasurer has tried to confuse people about how much they will get in this budget. The tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners only last a year, and, when they run out next year, the bottom 70 per cent will get only four per cent of the benefit of the tax cuts. In other words, the top 30 per cent get 96 per cent of the money from these multibillion dollar tax cuts. Frankly, a tax cut means nothing if you haven't got a job or enough work, and, for millions of Australians who had their JobSeeker and JobKeeper payments slashed last week, that is the reality right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that this parliament will need to step up and stop this corporate welfare and oppose these trickle-down tax cuts. And, let me remind you, none of this is a done deal. The Greens will move amendments in the Senate, and we hope the others come on board and stop these tax cuts for millionaires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only by aiming for full employment; investing in our renewable energy, our universities and public housing; and lifting people out of poverty can we call it a fairer, smarter, more productive society. That is what a Green recovery would do, and that's why I'm calling for a Green New Deal and why I'm calling for the government to create jobs, to help us get to full employment, instead of being satisfied with six per cent unemployment, as the Treasurer is proposing. We can literally build any future we want if we use the money wisely. I come into this parliament to make tomorrow better, to fight for the future for our children, not make it worse. I simply will not accept that the most important budget of a generation should screw over the next generation instead of giving them hope for a greener, cleaner, fairer future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made its choices, but that isn't the end of the fight. This parliament now has some very important choices to make. The Greens are clear in our choice. We will be standing in opposition to these unfair tax cuts that benefit the very wealthy and the corporate welfare in this budget that runs into the billions. Rather than racing out of the box to lock in unfair tax cuts, I urge Labor and the crossbench to take the time to properly scrutinise these bills and to work with us to amend them. I urge them to work with us to transform the government's trickle-down con job into something that actually gives hope to all of those who are depending on us right now.</span>

I would like to update the House on what we've been doing regarding carbon capture and storage, which, to most people, seems like some far-off acronym put out by the former coalition government, the Howard government, who funded carbon capture and storage flagships. But, on a deeper analysis of what's been happening around the world, it's actually quite a mature technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to see that carbon capture has been part of gas extraction for many years. The technology of capturing carbon is well established and has actually been used to deliver both more condensate and more gas from gas fields. The paradigm is that, by capturing the CO2 and other noxious gases that are made when industrial processes or electricity generation by burning black coal happens, one can decrease the environmental footprint of the electricity generation or the industrial process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the north of Australia, there is a huge carbon capture and storage project that is actually quite mature. Over in the US, there are second- and third-generation projects which are capturing CO2 and burying it in deep, sound, stable geological formations. The carbon is not kept in a big balloon under the surface. It actually gets dissolved into porous and permeable rock and is quite stable. But then the geological formation has to have a cap over it. They have identified another huge reservoir, apart from the one that's currently being used at Barrow Island. In mid-central and southern Queensland, there's a huge reservoir that could pipe CO2 from the coal-fired power stations in that area in a hub-and-spoke model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all about reducing carbon emissions. That is the paradigm that's been set by our international commitments. Everyone assumes that, to do that, you have to use solar or wind. But the problem with solar or wind is that the modern industrial world runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in rainy weeks, in wet seasons, when it's cloudy and overcast, when it's hot and the wind isn't blowing, or when there isn't sun to run solar panels. Everyone talks about the massive increase in install capacity of renewable generation in this nation. This gets everyone excited, but, unless that generation is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week, it's not going to solve our problem. That's why there's the requirement to have an energy system that has a certain amount of base load that is there pumping out electricity around the clock, every day of the week, every month of the year, come rain, hail or shine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were to shut down all our coal-fired power stationsâ€”our whole electricity network was built on that in the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties because of our natural advantage in having coal-fired power. But a lot of those original power stations weren't that efficient. They were like an old diesel truck from the 1950sâ€”they weren't very efficient either. But new coal-fired power stations are like the new diesel trucks that you see with twin turbos, common-rail technology and all the catalytic converters. All the technology that you can apply means that modern diesel trucks are hyperefficient, and they extract every last gram of energy out of the liquid fuel that's put in them. Again, it's a question of technology solving our problems, not taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my time has run out. That is enough for this evening, Mr Speaker. It has been a fascinating sojourn for many people who hadn't realised the wonders of modern technology. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="102376" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Everyone who serves in this place knows that they are able to be here as elected representatives only because of the support provided by their family and friends. Today I want to reflect on the life of someone whose family I became a part of a little more than 20 years ago. The remarkable extended family of Walter Murdoch King farewelled this wonderful gentleman last week, on 1 October. After a short illness, Walter died at the age of 88 in the loving company of his wife, Adelphe. Walter is the father of my husband, Jamie King, whom I first met 21 years ago and married soon after. I was warmly welcomed into the King family and into their significant and joyful extended family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was said last week in the memorial service to his life, Walter was interested in people and what they did, and he was always an enthusiastic conversationalist. Never lost for words, particularly when one was trying to leave a family gathering, Walter was kind, supportive and welcoming to me as a new member of the King clan. It should be no surprise that Walter King was a stellar conversationalist, given his father, Alec King, was a lecturer in English at UWA and his mother, Catherine King, was a much loved broadcaster on the ABC in Perth, responsible for the creation of the women's sessions and the development of kindergarten and early childhood education in WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Walter was born as the depression of the 1930s was setting in and, like many who grew up in those tough times, he was modest and frugal and learnt to make and repair things, a trait that his son Jamie has inherited and taken up enthusiastically. The toolkits and tool chests and all manner of powered gadgets in our garage attest to his enthusiasm. For most of the time I have known them, Walter and Adelphe have lived in the historic town of York, the oldest inland town in WA. Their shared love of the country saw them purchase 10 acres on the outskirts of town, and they called it Jarvisfield. Together they undertook the herculean effort of transforming a redundant wheat paddock into a comfortable home with a quite remarkable garden of mostly indigenous trees and plants, restoring the land from the devastation of agricultural clearing of many years before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">York is as pretty as a picture in winter but can be unbearably hot and dry in the summer. But, if you follow the dedication and commitment of people like Walter and Adelphe and you plant literally thousands of trees and you work and work at it, a transformation of the land can be had. Tomorrow the community of York will hold a second and final memorial to the life of Walter Murdoch King. For the decades they lived there, Walter and Adelphe were committed to the service of the local community. They were enthusiastic volunteers in the Holy Trinity Church, which occupies one of the oldest Anglican church buildings in the country, as well as in many local associations. They were stalwarts and servants of a community that loved them both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have Walter to thank for making me and Jamie keen keepers of bees. Walter got us a used beehive, set up our very first queen bee and got us a nucleus hive from his very expert neighbour, Kingsley Dixon, the former head of the Kings Park and Botanic Garden. It would be fair to say that Jamie and I were terrible beekeepers to start with, but 10 years later we've got better and better and have learnt much, and I doubt we would've become beekeepers without Walter and Adelphe getting us started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Walter and Adelphe have been very supportive of our decision for me to run for parliament some five years ago and were always interested in our travels together. Walter raised fine childrenâ€”a good woman, Mary-Ellen, and three good men, Matthew, Simon and the love of my life, Jamie King. You'll be sorely missed and fondly remembered, Walter King, now resting with God. Vale, Walter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  When the MYEFO was released in December last year, few if any among us could have predicted the economic, environmental and health impacts of 2020. Bushfires, drought, COVID-19 and the recession have all contributed to the $213 billion budget deficit announced last night, a figure so large that it seems beyond comprehension. But I do not want to focus on the billions; I want to focus on the approximately 13,000 small businesses in my electorate. Hospitality, tourism, agriculture and retail all feature prominently in my electorate and all have taken a hit because of the events of this year. But I have reason to hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I spent time at Melba's chocolate factory in Woodside, an area impacted by the Adelaide Hills bushfires. In fact, the fire went right up to the back of the factory. I spoke with Tom, the owner. He explained to me how his business has taken advantage of the instant asset write-off scheme to purchase new equipment, and they were able to retain valued and skilled staff members through the JobKeeper program. My statements should not be viewed as unequivocal support for the JobKeeper program. I appreciate the scheme was and still is not without its flaws, but I acknowledge that JobKeeper has helped and is still helping many small businesses and their employees to see their way through the uncertainty of the stages of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my hope that the JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme will in turn incentivise those businesses to take on new staff. The credit scheme will give $200 a week to employers who hire JobSeeker recipients aged 16 to 30 and $100 a week for any worker aged 30 to 35, provided they can offer 20 hours of work each week. This is the kind of youth unemployment program that our country needs. Many parts of Australia have stubbornly high youth unemployment, and that's pre COVID. I would say to government, though, that a similar credit scheme for older Australians, aged over 50, who are struggling to find employment would be equally welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support the continuation of JobKeeper and the introduction of the JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme, I believe the government has missed an opportunity to harness one of my electorate's most valued resources, and that is volunteering. Volunteering Australia estimates that the annual contribution of volunteering to our national economic and social wellbeing is $290 billion, and that is a conservative estimate and a figure that was determined many years ago. I was therefore disappointed by the lack of funding. Ten million dollars is what Volunteering Australia was seeking in order to develop a national youth volunteering initiative. We need to get young people out volunteering. Across my community, at any event where there's volunteering, it's predominantly older people. At a time when paid jobs are scarce, this initiative could mitigate poor mental health outcomes for young unemployed people and support pathways to paid employment while also supporting their own communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have already left the workforce or who are unable to participate by reason of disability or impairment are not immune from the combined impacts of the pandemic and the recession, and I welcome the two cash payments of $250, coming before Christmas and then in March next year. The payments will also go to anyone who is receiving the family tax benefit. This is really welcome for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout 2020, we have seen a paired economic and health response, and I'm pleased to see a one-year extension for the public adult dental health program, but I still encourage government to consider dental vouchers for older pensioners. We have this for people who receive the family tax benefit, people who have young children. I think we need to do this for our older citizens as well. I'm pleased to see the expansion of Medicare to cover psychology visits, up from 10 sessions to 20 sessions, and the continuation of teleservices as well as the allocation of 23,000 home-care packages over four years. We all know this is welcome, but we also know that there's a waiting list of over 100,000 older Australians who are needing assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a very difficult time, I think, in every electorate. In my electorate, in the last year, we've had fires and we've had COVID, and in many parts of my electorate we are also drought-declared. The budget will hopefully be a chance for our nation to rebuild again. We have much work to do, collectively, in this place and outside in our community, and I look forward to the days ahead. Thank you.</span>

Marilyn said, 'The Morrison LNP government left the people that need the help the most behind.' Peter said, 'The real losers are the people over 35 in casual jobs who will be sacked or lose a lot of hours so bosses can get on the "employ young workers" gravy train.' Damo pointed out: 'It sounds like they're playing the old trickle-down economics cardâ€”tax cuts that benefit the rich and big business first. We all know how that ends.' On child care, Maureen was pulling no punches when she said: 'They don't want women with children to work. They're stuck in the 1950s, where a woman's place was in the home and the husband earned the money and decided how it was spent.' There was no beating around the bush from Greg, either, when he said, 'The LNP show utter contempt for the seniors, the disabled, the unemployed and low-paid workers.' And Dave, with a poetic nod to the Prime Minister's favourite phrase, said, 'How good is a tax cut if you don't have a job?' </span>

It will rack up a trillion dollars of debt, and still that won't do enough to create enough jobs. It fails to build for the future and leaves too many Australians behind. The government tries to claim that its budget is a plan for jobs. Well, under its plan for jobs, it's going to produce an additional 160,000 new unemployed people before Christmas. How on earth is that a plan for jobs? That is indeed a plan for more no-jobs. So, whilst a million unemployed people over the age of 35 have been deliberately excluded from the hiring subsidies that are contained in the government's budget and while the average worker will receive a $50 per fortnight tax cut, millions on JobKeeper have seen their payment cut by at least $300 a fortnight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Burt alone, around 4,000 businesses and the 15,000 people that they employ rely on JobKeeper. But the government's recent JobKeeper changes could see many thousands of those workers thrust into the unemployment queues. Every local business in Burt that I speak to is worried not only about how the changes to JobKeeper might affect them and their employees but how decreases in JobSeeker and JobKeeper will affect their communities and their customers. You don't have to be a finance minister who's put together seven federal budgets to work out that less money trickling into people's pockets means less money flowing into the local economy. You would think that this is the issue that the government should have been addressing with this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the country, we're in a deep and very damaging recession. While we're lucky in WA to be seeing positive results on the coronavirus front, many are still struggling to keep food on the table and look after their families. This budget does little to repair that damage. Our south-eastern suburbs have missed out on any announced federal funding for infrastructure projects, meaning that we will get nothing to support local job opportunities and our local economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problems don't stop there. There is little support for the caring economyâ€”child care, aged careâ€”or indeed to support the unemployed aged over 35 in getting into the workforce, many of whom have children in child care and have no choice but to stay at home to care for their loved ones. What a perverse way to drive down the participation rate. The price of child care in our community is already well above the national average, with fees rising about six per cent in the last year. Families who have taken a pay cut over the past few months could be forced to give up child care altogether, and that would force them out of the workforce. Women are being left out and left behind by the federal government during this economic downturn, and this budget is doing nothing to address the significant job losses in industries dominated by women. Last night in the budget we saw nothing new on fixing the gender pay gap, super balances, domestic and family violence services or social housing. One trillion dollars of debt, a track record of no delivery and no plan for the futureâ€”that is the legacy of this Treasurer's COVID-19 budget. As Greg so eloquently put it, 'A typical, no-idea, no-plan Liberal budget.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  As a parent of four children, I know that bringing new life into the world is beautiful and life changing. However, for one in three Australian mothers, this experience is tainted by birth trauma. Giving birth has caused these women to endure physical injuries as well as mental distress, which they continue to live with daily. Today I present a petition to reinstate the MBS item for abdominoplasty surgery for women with abdominal tearing caused by pregnancy, a medical condition known as diastasis recti. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This Petition of Certain citizens of Australia</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016 Medicare withdrew the item number for abdominoplasty following pregnancy, without any public or clinical consultation. However, the Medicare benefit remains for significant weight loss. Pregnancy can cause similar abdominal injuries to obesity; injuries that cause debilitating long-term back pain and/or urinary incontinence. This negatively impacts the day-to-day quality of life for many women across Australia, affecting their ability to be physically active mothers. A study published in the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery: March 2018 - Volume 141 - Issue 3 - p 637-645, titled "Abdominoplasty Improves Low Back Pain and Urinary Incontinence" showed abdominoplasty significantly improves the incidence of chronic lower back pain and urinary incontinence in postpartum women. Women who seek abdominoplasty for purely cosmetic reasons should not be covered by Medicare, however those Australian women who suffer significant functional issues associated with their pregnancy injuries should be given Medicare assistance for life-changing abdominoplasty surgery. There are many operations performed for relief of chronic pain and instability incurred by sports injuries that are reimbursed by Medicare. Abdominoplasty associated with repairing pregnancy injuries should be considered in a similar light, in that it is a procedure that addresses pain, instability and function issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to adapt the Medicare benefit for abdominoplasty surgery to include women requiring corrective surgery to improve instability, pain and functional issues associated with pregnancy injuries, thereby improving the quality of life of many women across Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr MARTIN:</span>
                  </a>  This petition has been considered by the Petitions Committee and is found to be in order. The principal petitioner is a constituent who contacted me after I spoke in this place about birth trauma. Ms Kerrie Edwards of Drummoyne, New South Wales, who personally suffered abdominal tearing after giving birth to twins, has collected over 13,000 signatures on this petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abdominal tearing refers to tearing, stretching or rupturing of the abdominal muscles caused during pregnancy. Women who have multiple births or larger than average babies are more likely to experience this type of injury. It can cause chronic lower-back pain and urinary incontinence that impacts a woman's quality of life, her mental and physical health, her ability to care for her children, the decision to have more children and her capacity to return to the workforce. For some women it even impairs their ability to lift or carry their own children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abdominal separation in pregnant and postnatal women is first treated through physiotherapy, where the condition may resolve naturally; however, evidence has shown that this treatment has limited success in severe cases. Recent studies have shown that abdominoplasty surgery has high success rates for this type of injury, but for many women this life-changing surgery is out of reach. Some women are accessing their superannuation to pay for this surgery while others are taking out loans. In some cases women have to save for decades to afford the surgery, which can cost upwards of $15,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 Medicare withdrew the item number for abdominoplasty surgery following pregnancy. The reason? There was insufficient evidence to justify the MBS item number at the time. Since then a number of quality research studies, including Cochrane reviews, have been published. One Australian study has shown a statistically significant improvement in lower-back pain and urinary incontinence at both six weeks and six months after abdominoplasty surgery with the rectus repair in 214 patients. There is now good evidence indicating that abdominoplasty surgery improves lower-back pain, urinary incontinence and quality of life for birthing mothers with diastasis recti.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An evidence-based standardised assessment would be required to make sure that only suitable candidates access surgery through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. For instance, only women who are at 12 months post delivery should be considered. This would rule out patients who respond to physiotherapy treatment. I'm advised that calipers could be used to measure the inter-recti distance, followed by an ultrasound for those who screen positive, which will limit the use of the MBS item to those candidates in true clinical need of surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, abdominoplasty surgery has received a bad reputation as tummy tuck surgery, but this surgery has value in repairing abdominal injuries for functional reasons. In this context it is not cosmetic. This is why the Medicare benefit remains available for those suffering abdominal injuries following significant weight loss. This petition calls for this existing MBS item to include postnatal women with abdominal injuries alongside those who have injuries caused by obesity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No woman should have to live with severe abdominal injuries, chronic pain and incontinence. This surgery restores the dignity and quality of life to women living with birth trauma. It's important that we continue to improve perinatal care in Australia. When we do so we improve women's health, we support Australian families and we boost women's participation in the workforce.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Last week, the Department of Defence released a detailed investigation into PFAS in the vicinity of the RAAF base at Amberley in Ipswich, and, having read 1,500 pages of the report into the ecology and into human health, there was one line that stood out. That line, used repeatedly, was, 'The "do nothing" option cannot be justified.' Doing nothing was clearly not an option on the table. The potential risks to the human health and the environment based on the use of land and water at the RAAF base at Amberley and in the vicinity means that doing nothing is not a justifiable option, though I am somewhat comforted that, allegedly, the risks to human health are low or considered acceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been trying to get clarity on the levels of PFAS in and around Amberley for years, and so have local residents. It's a rural or semirural area. It's home to farms along with local fauna, including koalas, and other native fauna and flora, which means we cannot take unnecessary risks. On top of that, the base backs onto the residential suburbs of One Mile and Leichhardt, and PFAS has been found in Golf Links Estate, a relatively new residential enclave built on the old golf course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you some context, One Mile and Leichhardt are just five kilometres south of Ipswich's CBD. There are creeks that snake their way through the region and feed into the Bremer River and, eventually, the Brisbane River. It's for these reasons that communities and local families, along with current and former serving members of the Defence Force and I, are fighting to ensure that doing nothing is never considered a viable option again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, seeking government funding for voluntary blood-testing programs to be expanded to the RAAF base at Amberley. Regrettably, he has denied that. It's conducted around Williamtown, Oakey and Katherine. You would have thought that, for the largest RAAF base in the countryâ€”which is complete with its own firefighting facilities which utilise PFAS and is located close to a medium-density residential areaâ€”it would be considered unnecessary to ask for that support, but, unfortunately, the government has rejected it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 1,500 pages of an assessmentâ€”yet another report into this particular matter. While the risks are considered to be low, I call on the Minister for Defence to outline what the measures are to be taken and when they will be undertaken to remedy the situation for local residents. It's imperative the government acts sooner rather than later and improves. In context, I am grateful for former Ipswich city councillor, David Pahlke, who's given me a letter from the then Minister for Defence, dated 9 November 2001, to my predecessor saying: 'It's alright. There's nothing to worry about. I hope that allays your concern.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  The Morrison government is providing almost $1 million to support the Tjaltjraak Indigenous ranger team in the Esperance region of Western Australia. This will inspire and empower Esperance traditional owners to protect and conserve their land and sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an unacceptably high level of disadvantage in the Esperance Aboriginal community, with unemployment rates of up to 50 per cent. With half of the Esperance Aboriginal community under the age of 19, there is an opportunity for this next generation to overcome the disadvantage experienced by their elders. To that end, I've been working hard since 2018 to support the Tjaltjraak ranger program. On a personal note, I was honoured to be invited by elder Doc Reynolds to go out on country with the Tjaltjraak ranger team to learn the cultural burning practices they have been carrying out for over 40,000 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with chairperson Gail Reynolds-Adamson and CEO Peter Bednall from Tjaltjraak, it was a privilege to host the Hon. Ken Wyatt, federal Minister for Indigenous Australians, in Esperance recently. We visited the Tjaltjraak offices, inspected their new premises and discussed the size of their land area and the diversity of the projects they'll be working on. We then joined the Tjaltjraak rangers atop Dempster Head for a welcome to country followed by morning tea overlooking the stunning Recherche archipelago. It was the perfect setting to announce secure, ongoing funding under the federal Indigenous ranger program for this group to be able to perform on-country habitat restoration, do cultural survey work and host job-training activities that could lead to employment opportunities and business ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ranger projects strengthen communities in several ways. As well as the ecological, environmental and cultural benefits, the program will provide employment and broader economic development for the community. This funding will also ensure that the Tjaltjraak rangers can continue their role in fire mitigation work, cultural burning and the rehabilitation of areas affected by bushfires, following their collaboration with fire management authorities during local bushfire emergencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">After the announcement, female rangers conducted a bush tucker and medicine display at the Esperance Wildflower Show, which was well received by locals and tourists alike. Their presentation included the use of local bush plants and flowers as medicine, food and even building materials.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Wyatt finished his visit with a stakeholder lunch. It was a fantastic event with participants like Esperance Care Services, Hope Community Services, the Esperance Girls Academy, Escare and the Esperance Nyungar Aboriginal Corporation. All were very grateful for the minister's generosity with his time and for the opportunity to showcase their hard work and discuss their needs and opportunities moving forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the key stakeholders in the Esperance community for the valuable work they do and to thank Minister Wyatt for working with me to help meet the aspirations of the Esperance Aboriginal community.</span>

                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Today, I rise to speak about the Western Victorian Transmission Network Project in my electorate. This project will see 190 kilometres of overhead powerlines built by AusNet between Ararat and Western Melbourne. It is the first time really since the 1970s that we're seeing big investment in this sort of power line infrastructure. The power lines will be very large not only in length but also in sheer physical scale. To put it in terms that all Victorians understand, each of the transmission towers will be roughly the same height as an MCG light towerâ€”thousands of MCG light towers stretching all the way from Melbourne into the heart of Western Victoria. It's my view, and the view of many locals, that, wherever possible, these transmission lines should be placed underground. They should especially be placed underground where there is high bushfire risk, which there is in many areas in my own community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across much of the farmland that these power lines will go, there's never been this sort of built physical infrastructure. We know that, in our own community, we are the source of renewable energy. We're seeing great renewable energy projects, and we do want to get that into the grid. But, of course, that means that there are going to be some changes in the way that energy makes its way into the grid. But what I do want to say is that I think it's really important that local communities are engaged, and the understanding is given by bodies such as the Australian Energy Market Operator that consultation isn't something you do after the fact just to get through a planning process; it's something you have to do in a really complex way with local communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that underground will cost a bit more, but I think it is worth the effort to actually look at how governments can invest in transmission to get renewable into the grid in a way that not only doesn't impact on power prices but also provides the best possible outcome for local regional communities and mitigates against bushfire risks. Everyone knows and accepts that we need to upgrade our energy transmission network. For most of our modern history, Victoria's energy grid has been focused on getting power generated in the coal plants of the Latrobe Valley to the rest of the state. Increasingly, power comes from the west and the thousands of wind turbines that dot our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage AusNet and AEMO to actually think about the way they are engaging on this project. It would have been good if AEMO, in particular, had engaged with local councils in a very meaningful way about the planning of where these towers were to go prior to actually putting in the cost-benefit writ statement that they needed to do to the Energy Regulator, because we would have got a much better outcome. I do, again, implore AusNet and AEMO to actually think about the way in which they've run this project and to encourage them to engage far more closely with my local community right the way from Ararat toâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  The Goldstein school community should be proud of the resilience they've shown throughout the obstacles thrown at them by COVID-19. It's been a tough year for students. This year, students have been confined to their homes, separated from friends and extracurricular activities like sport, art, and music, and forced to miss school camps like the Grade 6 trips to Canberra. Students deserve congratulations for persisting with their studies despite the challenges of remote learning. Though they may be physically separated, Goldstein's teachers have stepped up as well and showcased their resourcefulness and adapted with technology. Having spoken virtually with classes from Firbank, St Joseph's Primary School, BGS, Bentleigh West Primary, McKinnon Sec, Leibler Yavneh, Haileybury, Kilvington, Sandy College and Star of the Sea, I've seen at firsthand just how hard teachers are working to feed hungry young minds. Thank you also to the students, the teachers and the parents of Beaumaris, Beaumaris North, Black Rock, Brighton, Brighton Beach, Caulfield, Caulfield South, Cheltenham, Elsternwick, Gardenvale, Hampton, Katandra, McKinnon, Ormond, Sandy, Sandy East, Sacred Heart, St Agnes', St Finbar's, St James's, St Joan of Arc's, St Kevin's, St Mary's, St Paul's, Stella Maris and Wesley College, as well as Beaumaris Secondary, Berendale, Brighton Sec, Melbourne Montessori, old St Leonard's and Xavier.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The classroom has been replaced with the living room. Parents have had to take on new roles while balancing work and other parenting duties. I know this is the story across the whole state. So thank you to the parents that have been called on to guide remote learning throughout 2020. It's been tough and you've stepped up too, particularly to support young residents so they don't have an interruption in their schooling year. Of course, it's truly unfortunate that our year 12s have missed many of the rites of passage which we all cherish as part of our development and for the rest of our lives. So, for those year 12 students in the Goldstein communityâ€”and also the year 11 ones coming upâ€”we wish you well in your forthcoming exams. You've conquered greater odds than any cohort in living memory. You've shown resilience and strength at a difficult time and adapted, often missing the companionship and support of your friends as well as your teachers. You should be really proud of what you've achieved. Frankly, I think it's harder than anything that a lot of people in this chamber, or your parents, have had to experience, so thank you. To all the people in the Goldstein community who have been part of the education journey this year, thank you. It's a testament to the strength of our community and how much we support each other that we've been able to guide these young minds. Hopefully they will have continued success as they enter into tertiary education, apprenticeships and work. Congratulations.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  The Prime Minister recently came to South Australia and failed to guarantee the Collins class sustainment jobs would remain in South Australia and not be shifted, at great cost, to Western Australia. This is a political problem of the government's own making. It's now caught in a vice of indecision, unable to guarantee submarine sustainment jobs in South Australia or to promise them to Western Australia, as some in their ranks would have them do. There is also, according to both the ABC and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, a very real delay in the design stage of the Hunter class frigate. The government should just come clean about what is the worst-kept secret in Defenceâ€”that there is a delay of somewhere between 12 and 24 months in the Hunter frigate shipbuilding schedule. If this delay is accepted, we will probably get a better frigate. If the design stage is rushed, we will probably get a worse one. The design stage of any shipbuilding schedule is critical to productivity in the shipyard and performance at sea. Denial of this problem will only cause a second 'valley of death' in South Australia in 2022. If we combine a shift in submarine sustainment jobs with the delay of the frigates, it will be a very severe valley of death indeed. In the first valley of death, we lost 1,000 jobs. This one could be just as bad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If a delay is accepted and if the government accepts that it cannot move submarine sustainment jobs, then basically a solution can be foundâ€”a solution that will protect jobs, capacity, expertise and productivity in Australia's shipbuilding industry, both in South Australia and in Western Australia. The government does have very real options to retain shipbuilding jobs in both statesâ€”to protect shipbuilding jobs in South Australia and to expand them in WA. It can order an extra six offshore patrol boats to fill the gap in the Hunter class frigate schedule, taking it from a total of 12 to a total of 18. These offshore patrol boats could be used in a manner as outlined in this ASPI report. Armed with a Naval Strike Missile and with mine-laying capabilities and UAV capabilities, they would expand our maritime capacity at a time of great instability. So I think there's a solution here for the Morrison government. They don't have to hack into submarine sustainment jobs in South Australia. They don't have to disappoint Western Australia. They can protect and expand jobs in both states by ordering additional offshore patrol vessels. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise to speak today in support of the measures announced in last night's federal budget. I would, in particular, like to commend the lifting of the cap on the instant asset write-off. This is a game changer for small businessâ€”not just for employers but employees also. Being a small-business owner myself for almost 20 years, I have long advocated for this measure. The former practice of depreciating an asset over many years stymied cash flow and ultimately cost jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, say a business made a net profit of $100,000 for a year and wanted to purchase a piece of equipment for that business that cost $100,000, on many occasions this wouldn't happen as they knew they had a tax bill coming and needed a portion of those profits to pay the upcoming tax bill. This meant that the business that they would have purchased the piece of said equipment from missed out on the sale, meaning less work for them and meaning they needed fewer employees, and the government missed out on the $9,000-odd of GST on the item, plus any income tax that would have been generated from the lower employee wages being paid, not to mention the truck driver who missed out on the delivery of the item, the installers who missed the opportunity to install the new piece of equipment, the warehouse and logistics staff who missed out on handling itâ€”the list goes on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As most people know, I am passionate about growing the Australian manufacturing industry. When I speak to local manufacturers in my electorate of Longman they tell me one of the stumbling blocks we had in this country for local manufacturing was the cost of equipment to expand or to initially set up a manufacturing business. It would take, in some cases, up to 10 years for manufacturing businesses to realise the tax deductibility through depreciation of major equipment purchases, which is a major drain on cash flow, and this prevented many businesses expanding or even starting up in the first place. This measure fixes that problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Policy decisions like this one put Australia on the map as a country that is open for business and give us a competitive edge over other countries in the global market. It means where previously we may not have been considered as a potential destination for setting up a manufacturing business we are now in the mix. This, of course, fulfils this government's three main priorities, which are jobs, jobs and jobs. In my humble opinion, we have had too many government leadership teams that have been managers, not leaders, in this country. Much time has been wasted in the past reactively putting out fires instead of proactively putting strategies in place and investing in the future so we don't have many of these fires in the first place. Scott Morrison and his leadership team have a vision for this country, and I'm proud to be a part of this team that I believe will deliver a season of prosperity in this great country.</span>

We know that our environment is under serious threat. While the recent bushfires have been overshadowed by the health and economic crises that we're currently facing, they were an undeniable sign of the extreme pressure our environment is under. This is an issue that many of my constituents in the seat of Adelaide have contacted me on and care deeply about, and I believe that's the case not just in my seat of Adelaide but around Australia. I've received hundreds of emails pleading for the government to do more to protect the environment. Today, I wish to echo their pleas. The Morrison government must listen and it must start taking the recommendations of the Samuel interim review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act seriously.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once every 10 years the EPBC Act is reviewed. These are our federal environmental laws and they underpin Australia's entire approach to protecting the environment. The review is being undertaken by former ACCC chief Graeme Samuel, and the government has now released the interim report and recommendations. In an interview on the ABC, Professor Samuel statedâ€”what he said is very disturbingâ€”that our current laws are ineffective, complex, costly to business and provide little benefit to the environment. He also stated that over the 20 years since the act has been in operation our environment has been in a state of steady decline. This is not only because the EPBC Act fails to achieve its environmental outcomes, butâ€”in Professor Samuel's own wordsâ€”it in fact 'impedes appropriate business development' as well. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This review is the perfect opportunity for us in this place and for the government to take stock and ensure that our laws are working in the best possible way to protect the environment, our wildlife and, of course, that they are supporting businesses at the same time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the environmental challenges facing us are rooted in these laws: inability to offer protections or stop the destructive impacts. For example, since the laws were introduced in 1999 we have not been able to stop even one animal from moving closer to extinction. In fact, Australia currently has the worst rate of mammal extinction anywhere in the world. We are the first country to see a mammal become extinct due to climate change. What's more, the EPBC laws don't even mention climate change. These are shameful messages that we have, and we are ableâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  Early October is a very special and important time for Australians who have Chinese, Korean or Vietnamese heritage because, in 2020, 1 October was the time when those communities celebrated what is one of the largest festivals in many Asian societiesâ€”the Moon Festival, sometimes also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, reflecting its Northern Hemisphere origins. In fact, the Moon Festival is the second-largest celebration on the Chinese calendar, and for Koreans and Vietnamese as well, after the Lunar New Year. It's an important festival which has its origins in ancient Chinese culture, in fact some 3,000 years ago, when moon worship, particularly by the emperors, was a common feature of society. Even today, 3,000 years on, it is celebrated as an opportunity to reflect on the full moon that happens at that time of year, but also things like the harvestâ€”called the harvest moon, as it isâ€”when communities came together to mark the end of the harvest season. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a time when families come together. There are some great rituals associated with this festival, including lantern displays and, of course, the ubiquitous mooncake, which is a popular feature of the Mid-Autumn Festival, as I've experienced myself over the last couple of weeks. Of course 2020 has been different, as it has been for so many of these events. Many of the public celebrations that we'd normally find in my electorate have been impossible because of COVID restrictions. But nonetheless, I know that families have come together as they traditionally do, bonded and shared the importance of this festival for their communities. I congratulate all of those in my own local community that have been able to honour this tradition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to represent an electorate which has one of the largest Australian Chinese communities in Australia. But I also want to reflect on the fact that the last six months has been particularly difficult for them, as for all of Australia. In fact, it's fair to say that the Australian Chinese community probably experienced the impact of COVID first because of its first wave in mainland China and the impact that that had on families and friends of the Australian Chinese community. I also want to reflect on the fact that it was probably the Chinese Australian community that were the first to react in a positive and responsible way to the challenges that COVID was presenting to our community. I saw this in my own electorate, where I saw so many businesses responsibly adapting to making sure that their customers were safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has led me to form what I hope will be an enduring feature of my work, namely, the North Sydney Chinese Community Forum. This is bringing together Chinese community leaders across my electorate. We've so far met three times, via the ubiquitous Zoom tool most recently, and I'm really thrilled that Minister Tudge was able to attend the last of those meetings. I will continue to support my local Chinese community, which is such a vibrant and important part of my own local community. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  The Morrison government's massive increase in university fees for humanities courses is unfair, and will undermine our future productivity and hold our nation back. At high school I was fortunate to benefit from a very passionate and wise economics teacher, Mr Peter Singer, who ignited in me a passion for economics and encouraged me to study that at university. I was fortunate to be able to afford to go to university because the fees were subsidised by government with a deferred loans payment program. I was fortunate to pursue my passion for economics. I'm concerned that many young Australians will have their opportunity to pursue their passion robbed by this government and their massive fee increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This fee increase will rob many young Australiansâ€”those that are interested in law, in communications, in economics, in commerce, in social science and humanitiesâ€”of the opportunity of an affordable university degree. Forty per cent of students will have their fees increased from next year under this reform, and some courses will double in their cost. It will be unfair and it will take Australia back to the dark days of only the wealthy being able to afford to go to university, and that is not in our nation's best interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The immediate effect will be on this year's group of year 12 students. Haven't these students been through enough with the pandemic and the interruptions to their education? Now they get this kick in the guts from the Morrison government with the possibility of massive fee increases for them if they're studying humanities at university next year. That is unfair. That's why over 700 people in the community that I represent have signed a petition against these reforms. I thank each and every one of them for showing their support for university education in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will also hold our nation back. We're in a recession now. How do you recover from a recession? We increase productivity, and to increase productivity you need to invest in people. The best way to invest in people is to invest in education, particularly in technical and TAFE education and in university education. This reform makes it harder for young Australians to get an education. When you hold a young Australian's education back, you hold Australia back. And that is what this will do, because we will be a less-educated nation and we will be less productive into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement has come about with a dirty deal from the Morrison government, One Nation and Centre Alliance, who've sold out young Australians and made university unaffordable for the next generation of Australians. They should be ashamed of themselves for dudding young Australians and for dudding our nation's future productivity.</span>

John recently passed away and will be sadly missed by his family and, indeed, the whole community. Just before he passed, John had an oval at Casino's Queen Elizabeth Reserve officially named after him. It's great recognition for the achievements and contribution he made to local cricket over 65 years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">His first game of cricket was for Tatham in 1948, and his cricket career spanned 55 years. During this time, he scored 11 centuries. JJ was also heavily involved in the administration of Casino District Cricket Association. He spent 30 years as the treasurer and 12 years as the vice president. He has received many accoladesâ€”life membership of the Casino District Cricket Association, Far North Coast Cricket Council and Casino Bowling Club, and he was awarded an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a volunteer services award in 2008.</span>

JJ and Maxine also had 13 grandchildrenâ€”Andrew, Amanda, Sarah, Ashley, Thomas, James, Samantha, David, Matthew, Rachael, Ryan, Hailey and Gus. We have lost, in our community, a true gentleman and a man who was dedicated to our community. Rest in peace, JJ.</span>

He's one of the valley's longest-serving bus drivers. He worked at the Grafton depot for his entire career as a school and long-term charter driver. Peter met his wife Sandra when they were 17 at a dance at the pavilion. They have two daughters, Carolyn and Susanne. Sandra says it was always Peter's dream to be a bus driver. He never complained or had any problems with the kids, although he was strict and made sure they were always seated. He also worked and inherited his father's butcher shop, Perkins Butchery in South Grafton, which was famous for its toys in the windows. Thank you, Peter, and congratulations on your retirement.</span>

This is a competition for top working dogs across the country. The dogs are given a GPS collar that tracks their distance, working duration and speed over a three-week period. Glenda and Buddy set a new Cobber Challenge record on their beef cattle property, Cinnabar, at Copmanhurst. Buddy did 835 kilometres over a three-week period, worked 98 hours and recorded an average speed of 8Â½ kilometres per hour. Glenda said after the win that Buddy got two juicy bones, a comfy bed and a big cuddle. Congratulations Glenda and Buddy!</span>

Born in New Zealand to Irish migrant parents, John led a life of service in many ways. In his lifetime he was a true asset to the people, serving as Premier of New South Wales between 1992 and 1995 and then entering federal politics as the member for Macarthur between 1996 and 2001 and during that time serving as the Minister for Finance. In his role as the NSW Premier, John introduced the Disability Services Act and the New South Wales Seniors Card and appointed the first minister for the status of women.</span>

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that this comes down to John's 'hard head, soft heart' approach to governing, an approach that will hopefully inspire many of the parliamentarians who follow him. In 1996, he entered federal politics. He was elected the member for Macarthur and served as the Minister for Finance in the Howard government, a challenging portfolio to take on in the mid-1990s when Australia was still climbing out of recession. He made hard decisions, sometimes unpopular decisions but, nonetheless, necessary ones in order to limit government expenditure and get the budget back on track. His decision-making fortifies us now as we face Australia's worst recession on record, due to the coronavirus.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While John would never have known it at the time, he profoundly shaped my seat of Reid. He is best remembered for his role in the successful bid for Sydney to host the 2000 Olympics. It was his bid that planted the seed for 'the best Games ever.' Reid's Sydney Olympic Park is evidence of his legacy as Australia's most iconic national and international entertainment and sporting precinct. It is also a bustling business and residential area, as well as being home to beautiful parklands and recreational facilities. Following his career in politics, John also took on the role of Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, which has a campus in Reid. As chancellor, John encouraged the Australian Catholic University to develop into a university of stature. Under his stewardship, the Australian Catholic University underwent sustainable expansion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's faith was an important part of his life and strengthened his fighting spirit. He battled lung cancer almost 20 years ago, and he also survived the tragic loss of his daughter Tiffany in 2006. John led a life of service in many, many ways. I send my condolences to his loved ones and feel certain his impact will be long felt by the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise as the member for Macarthur to offer my condolences to the family of John Joseph Fahey. Macarthur has had some interesting members over the yearsâ€”going right back to the original member for Macarthur, Jeff Bate, who later married Harold Holt's widow. It is my view that there has been no better member for Macarthur than John Joseph Fahey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He led a life of faith, of family, of service and of humility. My friend Jim Marsden describes John as a man who changed Jim's life forever for the better. Jim was working as a solicitor in Wollongong because he didn't get on with his brother, John Marsden, who ran the Marsdens practice in Camden, and it was John Fahey who visited Jim several times and talked him into coming back and joining his brother John in the Marsdens Law Group, which has gone on to become a very influential group of lawyers in south-western Sydney and beyond. Jim credits John Fahey with, as I said, changing his life for the better and never asking any credit for that and never, in his own humble way, requesting any favours because of that. Jim knew John Fahey very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met John Fahey on several occasions since I started my medical practice in 1984, at the same time as John started at Marsdens solicitors in February 1984. He was always known as a very good lawyer, a very decent man and a man who believed in both his faith and his family. John Fahey was almost a baby boomer, born in January 1945. He took the best of both those generations, the war generation and the baby boomers, throughout his life, showing such great attributes as hard work, humility and, once again, faith and family. He played football initially at St Anthony's for the Picton Magpies. He went to school at St Anthony's primary school in Picton, which still exists, and later went to high school at Chevalier College and then on to Sydney University. He played lower grade rugby league for the Canterbury Bulldogs and they remained the love of his sporting life throughout his life. He married Colleen McGurren, a coal miner's daughter in 1968 and they had three children, Matthew, Melanie and Tiffany. Tragically, Tiffany was killed in a motor vehicle accident at the age of 27, and Tiffany's two children, Campbell and Amber, were brought up by John and Colleen as their surrogate parents. By all accounts, they did a wonderful job as parents the second time around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John had multiple achievements. There are too many to name them all. He won the seat of Camden for the Liberal Party in 1984 in the state parliament and transferred to the Southern Highlands seat in 1988. He then replaced Nick Greiner as state Premier in 1992 after Nick Greiner was forced to resign after an ICAC investigation. John Fahey described that as one of the saddest days of his life, interestingly, because he believed that Nick Greiner had been unfairly persecuted. John went on to become a very good state Premier, being defeated, however, by Bob Carr in 1995. In 1996, John became the member for Macarthur until 2001, when he resigned because of his first bout with malignancy. He lost a lung to lung cancer, after a long history of cigarette smoking, and then went on to achieve even greater things, including as the President of the Bradman Foundation, President of the World Anti-Doping Agency from 2007 to 2013, and Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University. He was, of course, a devout Roman Catholic and practised his faith throughout his life, until his death. His legacy is huge. As a member for Macarthur, if I do 10 per cent as well as John Fahey did, I will have done very well. Vale, John Fahey. He will be missed. He was a great servant of the state and its people and he will be missed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  It was March 1994, and a young 18-year-old was in the wings of the Darling Harbour convention centre rather nervously, wearing an ill-fitting suit belonging to his father, waiting to go up onto the stage to meet then Premier John Fahey. That 18-year-old was meâ€”I'd graduated from high school the year beforeâ€”and I was receiving an academic award, a NSW Premier's award, for my HSC results. This was the biggest occasion I had been involved in, up until that time, in my life, and I remember waiting nervously for my name to be called out and to bound up onto the stage and shake the Premier's hand. As always happens on these big occasions, you can often overthink things, and, as I reached the top step of the stage, I tripped and stumbled and sprawled my way across the floor and slid into the feet of the then Premier John Fahey. I can't imagine a more ignominious entrance to receive an award, but John, the gentleman and truly decent man he was, quickly pulled me to my feet, made a joke about it, put me at ease, shook my hand and, I think, probably gave me more of a rousing send-off than any of the other following recipients, who didn't do what I had done in slipping up and falling on the stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John had moved equally quickly two months earlier on Australia Day in 1994 when he'd moved to shield Prince Charles from an attack at the time. But, like many Australians, I think my most vivid memory, my first memory of John Fahey, when he pierced my consciousness, was the night when Sydney won the right to host the Olympic Games in 2000. This was in September 1993, and it was his jump for joy alongside the head of the bid committee, Rod McGeochâ€”he's still with us today and still a constituent of mine in Wentworthâ€”when the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, declared in his distinctive Spanish accent, 'The winner is Sydney!' It was John's jump for joy alongside Rod McGeoch, his unbridled joy and his enthusiasm, which I think spoke to a genuineness of character and authenticity, which was one of his most defining characteristics as a person and one that he carried through with him into public and political life. This was a man who was very deeply grounded in the ideals of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was first elected as a state member of parliament in 1984, to the seat of Camden, rising to become the Premier of New South Wales from 1992 to 1995. He then moved to federal politics in 1996, winning the seat of Macarthur and immediately joining the ministry of the first Howard government, serving as finance minister for five critical years, helping to turn around public finances at the time and presiding over the privatisation of Telstra. He left the federal parliament in 2001 after 17 years of parliamentary service, both state and federal, due to ill-health, only to embark, once his health had recovered, on another career of service. John went on to be a director of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, chairman of the rugby league development board, Chairman of the Sydney Olympic Park Authority and, most significantly, Chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, one of the most significant sporting administrator positions in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this lifetime of service, John was a deeply committed family man. He was a loving husband to Colleen. He was a father. He was a grandfather. Whilst I can't pretend to have known John personallyâ€”and I know we only met on a few occasions, and, although he loomed as a significant figure in my life, I was undoubtedly not one in hisâ€”I do recall a recent encounter with him at a dinner held just last year in the Great Hall of Parliament House for the 75th anniversary of the Liberal Party. John was there with his wife, Colleen. Although it was a crowded night, he made a point of searching me out and congratulating me for my electoral success in my second attempt to win the seat of Wentworth. This personal touchâ€”that he would bother, with so many others vying for his attention, with so many others he knew better at the dinner that evening, and with many others with whom he would have preferred to be having a conversation, no doubtâ€”was a touching gesture, and I remember it well and I remember it very fondly. I think, without wishing to flatter myself here, it spoke to the fundamental decency and deep humanity of the person who was John Fahey. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know faith was important throughout John's life, and I hope that faith provides some comfort to those he leaves behindâ€”his wife, Colleen, his surviving children, Melanie and Matthew, and his grandchildren, Amber and Campbell, to his daughter Tiffany. May they have all comfort in this difficult time, and may John rest in peace. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  May I begin by associating myself with the remarks of the member for Macarthur, the member for Wentworth and other members that have spoken about this wonderful Australian, John Fahey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About five years ago, <span style="font-style:italic;">The N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ew York Times</span> columnist David Brooks wrote a wonderful book called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Road to Character</span>. In a column in <span style="font-style:italic;">The N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ew York Times</span> about the same time, he wrote an opinion piece which really summarised the central theme of his book. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It occurred to me that there were two sets of virtues, the resume virtues and the eulogy virtues. The resume virtues are the skills you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that are talked about at your funeralâ€”whether you were kind, brave, honest or faithful. Were you capable of deep love?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that, fundamentally, those eulogy values are more important than the resume ones. But our culture and our educational systems spend more time teaching us about the skills and strategies you need for career success than the qualities that you need to radiate that sort of inner light we so rarely find. Many of us are clearer on how to build an external character than on how to build an internal character. One of the things about John Fahey is that throughout his life he built both the external character and the internal character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Fahey was a remarkable man: a chain-smoking, rugby league playing Irish Catholic, solicitor, former trainee priest, and a bloke who was in law firm practice with the very controversial John Marden. John Fahey's presence in our party was a reminder to us and the Liberal Party that the party at its best is a party that represents all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was a member of the New South Wales Parliament for 11 years. He was Premier of New South Wales for almost three years. As everybody else who has spoken about John has remarked, John is most remembered for winning the Sydney Olympicsâ€”and 'the jump for joy', as the member for Wentworth said. The Olympics were an extraordinary moment in Australian history, and everyone who lived through that moment saw the best in our country as our city showed what it was really like when everything worked like clockwork for that magical fortnight and when we were on display and showed our values and our way of life best to the rest of the world. John is also remembered for that heroic actionâ€”a strange heroic action for a republicanâ€”in rescuing Prince Charles from an attacker, David Kang, who today is a Sydney barrister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John later served as a member of the Commonwealth parliament for five years, and he served all that time as Minister for Finance. The Howard government had inherited $96 billion of debtâ€”which, at that time, was an enormous amount of debt, though it doesn't seem quite so big in today's standardsâ€”and both John Fahey and Peter Costello had the herculean task of starting to repay the debt and to get the budget back in order. Peter Costello, in his memoirs, talked about the first budget and that first expenditure review committee, and I thought it was worthwhile quoting him here. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The room in which the ERC met had no windows, no fresh air and no telephones. During that first winter we generally would be there for twelve hours a day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A brotherhood tends to develop among the Ministers on the ERCâ€”and it was particularly strong during our first year in Government. I got to know John Fahey, former premier of New South Wales and the Government's first Finance Minister, well. He became a valued friend during this process. He was a great raconteur, Like all the Irish, he could talk. Sometimes as a punishment for long-winded Ministers, I would ask John to reply to their arguments. He could go a lot longer in reply than they did in making their submissions. Letting John loose was a tactic designed to wear down even the most loquacious of the other Ministers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's political career was sadly cut short by his diagnosis of lung cancer and, in 2002, he ultimately lost a lung. Anybody who spent time with Johnâ€”and the Speaker told the story yesterday in the Houseâ€”knew it was hard for John to go up stairs and it was hard for John to walk around generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to reflect on some my own experiences with John Fahey. John had a seminal and formative experience in my own political journey. The first campaign that I ever worked on as a political apparatchik, as it were, was as 18-year-old in John's last campaign as the member for Southern Highlands, the same year that he was Premier of New South Wales, in 1995. I was 18 years old. I'd gone to the birthday party of a friend of mine and impressed her father, who happened to be John's SEC president in the Southern Highlands, who said to me, 'Why don't you come down and campaign for John, and you will get to meet him and it will be a great experience for you? You obviously have an interest in politics. This would be great.' The father of my friend Clareâ€”whose party I had been atâ€”Murray Branch, who is no longer with us either, was a legend in Goulburn and a legend in the Liberal Party in that part of the world. I remember that hot day in February 1995. It was a big garden party out on their lawn in Goulburn, and Murray had arranged for me to have some time, just one on one with Johnâ€”which was so generous. John was the Premier of New South Wales at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember three things about John. Firstly, I remember that he had security guards. I had never seen a politician who had security guards before. In 1995 the world was a less dangerous place, but even then the Premier of New South Wales needed to have their own security. Secondly, John was taller and more engaging in the flesh than he was on television. I think that's probably true of all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281826" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Thompson:</span>
                  </a>  Not me!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LEESER:</span>
                  </a>  Maybe not my friend to the right here! Thirdly, John was really generous in talking and sharing his wisdom with a complete political neophyte like me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That February it seemed as if John Fahey couldn't lose the election. He was incredibly popular. He had won the Olympics, he had saved Prince Charles' life, he had managed the hung parliament well and he seemed to have the common touch. So it surprised me on election day, having spent the whole day handing out how-to-vote cards and scrutineering at Goulburn East, to come back to the party with the results in to find that John had retained his seat but lost the election. After the election, John wrote me a generous thankyou note and we kept in touch from time to time at party functions over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I really got to know John well when he became Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, which is where I spent four years prior to being here. I joined ACU in 2012, and John became chancellor in 2014. He had huge shoes to fill. The previous chancellor had been Sir Peter Cosgrove, who was well loved by everyone at the university as well as a national hero and who went on to be Governor-General. But John did a fantastic job, with his humility and his common touch. Being the chancellor of a multicampus university is a difficult task, but I think the chancellor of a catholic university has additional issues. You have to manage the highly important church politics as well as dealing with educational and health stakeholders. John having been a former premier of New South Wales was particularly useful because anybody who's had interactions with the New South Wales education ministry and its very large bureaucracy will know what a difficult beast that can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John presided over the university's 25th anniversary celebrations, and he saw campuses open in as diverse places as Rome and Blacktown. While John didn't get to host the Sydney Olympics because Bob Carr was the Premier at that time, he did get to host the International Federation of Catholic Universities conference, which is like the Olympics for Catholic universities. This was a great event and it was a defining event of John's chancellorship. It really put the university on the map.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of ACU under John's leadership and under the leadership of Greg Craven is of a university that was at the margins of the Australian education system and at the margins of the global Catholic education system moving to be the largest Catholic university in the English-speaking world, the largest producer of nurses and teachers in this country and a global success story for a church that was facing an extensional crisis the likes of which it had never seen. John's role in leading and stewarding the university and providing that good news to people in the Catholic Church not only here but around the worldâ€”and to Australiansâ€”was a terrific thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was honoured by the support John gave me in my own role and was delighted and touched that he came to my farewell in 2016. At a mass offered for John's life at ACU last week, Greg Craven provided the vice-chancellor's insight into John's approach to his role. He said: 'We, his university family, knew and loved John as chancellor. He was a wonderful chancellor, as only a vice-chancellor can fully know. He was wise, loyal and supportive. If I did something he thought was right, he would ferociously defend me. If I did something he thought was stupid, he would tell me I was an idiot in private and then ferociously defend me in public. If I did something he thought was dumb and which he later decided was right his defensive plays were of a type that would have got him sent off when he was playing for his beloved Bulldogs.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vice-President of the university, Father Anthony Casamento, reflected on John's deep sense of purpose. I think this quote from Father Anthony Casamento is really fundamental to who John was and why he was such a centred person. He said: 'When John began his term as chancellor, he shared with me an idea that he picked up in a copy of John Henry Newman's work <span style="font-style:italic;">The Idea of a University</span>. I think that Newman is eminently insightful as well as quotable in a manner that can lead to reflection and prayer. One of the most significant quotes is this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">God has created me to do Him some definite service. He has committed some work to me which He has not committed to another. I have my mission. I may never know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. I am a link in a chain, a bond of connection between persons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know John believed that and I believe that he saw his work, his extraordinary work, as a means of being that link in a chain, a bond of connection between persons, a preacher of truth.' Those are the words of Father Anthony Casamento.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Fahey was one of the most decent and honourable men ever to go into Australian public life. If any of us have half the career that John Fahey had, we can count ourselves lucky. But if we can both come here and leave our parliamentary careers here with reputations for integrity as high as John Fahey, we will have done a good thing. To Colleen and John's family, we send our condolences. May John's memory be a blessing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to a woman who was a trailblazer in this place and whose actions spoke not only to her own generation but to those who followed. In 1975, the Hon. Susan Maree Ryan AO campaigned on the slogan 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' Time would also prove that it was a woman's place that was in the cabinet, in the High Court, in Government House and, indeed, in The Lodge. Susan Ryan's actions and achievements paved the way for these to happen. Indeed, Susan leaves an enviable legacy that transcends partisan politics and profoundly changed how Australian society operates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was principled, determined and incredibly hardworking. She entered the Senate in 1975 before spending seven years in opposition. During this time, she served in a variety of roles, including shadow minister for communications, the arts and the media and, later, Indigenous affairs. She later became the first woman in a Labor cabinet, serving as a Minister for Education, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women and the Special Minister of State. However, Susan was much more than Labor's first cabinet woman. She was an exemplary public servant. Susan spearheaded policies that lifted year 12 retention rates from one-third to two-thirds. Susan was also the architect of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act. This made sexual harassment illegal and bolstered women's economic empowerment. It meant women could study whatever they wanted without restriction. It meant women could have a career and childrenâ€”not one or the other. It meant women could buy a home without needing the husband or father alongside them. The women and girls of today stand on Susan Ryan's shoulders, just as she stood on the shoulders of those before her.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women have not had the role models to look to that men have, because it is only in relatively recent history that we have witnessed women in power. Like men, women need to be able to look across the country and see themselves represented at every point of significant influence. The concept that 'if she can do it, so can I' is a very powerful motivator. Men take for granted that they have role models of power and influence. For women, this is a relatively recent development. Take, for example, my cousin Margaret Bondfield, who was the first female cabinet member in the UK parliament almost 100 years ago. She was the first female member of the Privy Council in its history. In those days, womenâ€”like our party's co-founder Dame Elizabeth Couchmanâ€”had to choose between public life and having a family. The legacy of these womenâ€”along with Susan Ryanâ€”is left for us to champion. This includes promoting economic and social equality for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, the governmentâ€”led by my predecessor Kelly O'Dwyer, Minister for Women and former member for Higginsâ€”released the inaugural Women's Economic Security Statement. This investment of $119 million had three key pillars. The first was to increase workforce participation, the second was to improve earning potential, and the third was to promote economic independence. I am proud that last night the budget included our second Women's Economic Security Statement, with $240 million in measures and programs to support new cadetships and apprenticeships for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematicsâ€”an issue that's very dear to my heartâ€”job creation and entrepreneurialism, and women's safety at work and in the home. These measures are needed now more than ever to help regain the strides we had made pre-COVID to increase women's work participation and to decrease the gender pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Treasurer said last night in his budget speech, Australian women made up the majority of those who've lost their jobs during this COVID crisis. As the health restrictions have eased, however, these jobs have started to come back, with 60 per cent of the 458,000 jobs created since May filled by women. This is a welcome development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much to do in this place to support women, not because of COVID-19 but despite it. As a working mother of four, I know at a very personal level the juggle that has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Australia will be forever indebted to Susan Ryan's public service. We must pick up the baton from the women who went before us and continue their important work. I extend my sincere condolences to Susan's partner, Rory, and her children, Justine and Benedict, and her grandson, Amir. May she rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  I rise today in memory of Susan Ryan. Susan was a senator, a feminist, a mentor, a hero and a friend. She lived a great Australian life, of which we are all beneficiaries. I know I certainly am. She was born in Camperdown but spent her childhood in Maroubra, among the surf and the sun and the Catholic Church. She was educated by the Brigidine nuns, and I know a lot of girls that were educated by the Brigidine nunsâ€”good feminists, all of them. They taught the girls to be confident and unconventional, proving their service through action. According to Susan, there was a clear link between her time at the convent school and her feminism. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If convent girls did what the nuns told themâ€”examined their consciences, tried to find the truth, stood up for themselves, strove for altruistic ... motivesâ€”it is no wonder they took to the second wave of feminism like ducks to water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan's absolute passion for justice was deeply influenced by that time with the Brigidine sisters. You could see it, even as she was what my godmother would have called 'a lapsed Catholic'. She was culturally Catholic throughout her life. She was someone who believed passionately in the fundamental truths of not just Catholicism but any religionâ€”what we owe to each other; the service that we owe to each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when only five per cent of young women went to university, she won a scholarship to the Sydney Teachers' College. She had to actually pay back the scholarship when it was discovered that she was engaged. From there, she became a teacher, a mother, a publisher, an activist, an academic and, finally, a parliamentarian. Her decision to take the plunge into politics was motivated by her frustration at the limits of activism. Susan was a founding member here in the ACT of the Women's Electoral Lobby, but she concluded that, while lobbying was absolutely vital and critical, women would never achieve full equality without direct representation in the rooms where the decisions are being made. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How much more efficient, I thought, how much more effective, if we were in there making the decisions, instead of knocking on the doors trying to attract support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1975, there was not a single female member of the House of Representatives. It really seems impossible to think of that in our lifetimeâ€”my lifetime and yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman. Susan ran for the Senate that year as a 33-year-old single mum, with her remarkable slogan, 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' It was revolutionary then and it is iconic today. Susan's politics were always clear. She could never tolerate discrimination of any sortâ€”not against the old, not against the poor, not against women. This simple idea shaped everything that Susan Ryan did as a senator and everything that she did as Labor's first female cabinet minister. Her crowning achievementâ€”what she called the most useful thing she did in her lifeâ€”was the Sex Discrimination Act. She'd originally developed it in opposition as a private member's bill before having the opportunity to legislate it when Labor came to government. This is a very important point for parliamentarians who would hope to learn something from Susan Ryan's legacy: she didn't treat opposition as a time to relax and cruise. She was working every day, preparing for the opportunity and the honour of governing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems completely uncontroversial now for us to say that it's unacceptable for an employer to advertise, 'I want a man to fill this job,' or, 'I want a woman to fill this job,' or, 'No-one who's pregnant need apply, and, if you get pregnant, you're able to be sacked,' but it was certainly not uncontroversial when Susan Ryan introduced the Sex Discrimination Act; it was incredibly controversial. I remember a little bit of it as a child. Looking back on the history books, Fred and Elaine Nile and organisations like Women who Want to be Women organised protests and accused Susan of 'making men eunuchs in their own kingdom'. One of the things that is extraordinary about this is that it wasn't just Susan's political opponents on the other side of the chamber who were critical of this; it was many of her own colleagues, fighting hard in marginal seats, saying: 'Susan, please. Why do we have to do this? It's so controversial. Can't we just let it drop?' I think it's such a tribute to Susan Ryan's clarity of vision, her commitment to change and her courage but also her courtesy and her light touch. She was prepared to fight this as hard as it took, but she did it with such good spirit and good grace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look back now deeply grateful for these changes. It took all of her willpower and all of her skill and experience to take this one ideaâ€”that gender based discrimination should not be allowed in our workplacesâ€”and make it reality. We owe her a great debt for that, because it's never easy being the first. It may seem easy in hindsight, but it's not. People will criticise you, they will ridicule you and, when you win, they'll claim that they agreed with you from the very beginning. Susan is celebrated now, but she walked through fire to do what she did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish this condolence with a reflection on Susan Ryan as a person and a mentor in the Labor Party. I could talk all day about her professional achievements. She did so much in the education, aged-care and disability-rights portfolios, but, even if I spent the whole afternoon talking about all of those achievements, what you would miss is her vitality and her warmth. She was enormous fun. She loved literature, she loved music, she loved nature, she loved life, she was deeply proud of her Irish heritage and she was the absolute opposite of a snob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember going to Labor Party conferences as a young activist, long before I was elected to parliament. Susan would fight all day on the conference floor, and then she would sit long into the evening with any of the young activists who wanted to talk to herâ€”never too busy to give a word of advice or have a laugh, a drink or a chat. She was encouraging and she was supportive. Even after her extraordinary success in public life, she had time for people. We remember Susan for her amazing life, for all she did to make a career like mine possible and for all she did for Australian women. Her loss is immense for her family, for her partner, Rory, for Justine and Benedict, for her grandchild, Amir, for our party and for this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Let me associate myself with the remarks made and the tribute paid by the member for Sydney. The Hon. Susan Ryanâ€”Officer of the Order of Australia, a true groundbreaker, a crusader for justice, a champion for equality, a role model for manyâ€”arrived in the Senate in 1975, the ACT's first female senator and a single mother of 33 years at the time. She went on to become Labor's first female cabinet minister when the Hawke government was elected in 1983, and one of her enduring legacies is her private member's bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of gender, which became the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was born in Sydney in 1942â€”the same year and the same town as my mother. My mother was involved in feminist causes and groups when I was growing up. She, like many of her generation, had left school at 16 and, in the 1980s, with her children at a young age, she'd gone back to university to finish her high school education and to obtain a degree. As a child growing up I remember that Susan was often someone spoken of in hallowed terms by my mum around our dinner table and held up as a role model to me and especially my two elder sisters. Susan Ryan said in a newspaper interview in 2017:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I felt from the youngest possible age that it was unfair, intolerable really, that females were regarded as second-class citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the same lesson my mother sought to instill in me and my two sisters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As others here, including from the Labor Party, who know her life and career much better than me, have said, much of which we now take for granted today is only possible because of the trail that Susan Ryan blazed. As she said in her own words, this was a trail that would allow women to be able to pursue opportunities 'unencumbered by stifling stereotypes', that 'There should be no unfair obstacles put in the way of their achieving independence,' and that 'Women and men should be judged on their merits, not on how far they reinforce some socially useful or commercially contrived norm.' As she wrote in an opinion piece last year on Bob Hawke's legacy, she entered national political life at a time when 'it was not unlawful to sack women who married or became pregnant' when 'maternity leave was scarcely available' when 'women could not get home loans' or personal finance loans' and when the educational opportunities afforded to girls were highly restricted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After leaving parliament in 1987, Susan Ryan went on to hold roles as the Age Discrimination Commissioner and the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. She brought the same sense of purpose and justice to these roles as she did to her parliamentary career, to compel her fellow citizens to recognise that older Australians and Australians with a disability deserve to live a life of equal dignity, purpose and opportunity as the rest of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The causes that Susan Ryan championed remain with us today, and there is more that must be doneâ€”but we have a good role model to hand. To my mind, she is Australia's equivalent of a Ruth Bader Ginsburg in terms of the role model she provided for women and the enduring impact she has had on stifling social and legal norms which held back our country. Susan Ryan's championing of the rights of women, through the force of her intellect, the persuasion of her arguments and the power of her example, allowed her to shatter glass ceilings at a time when the ceilings were made not of glass but of reinforced concrete. She blazed the trail in the true meaning of the term, burning a pathway through a dense forest where none had existed before, for others to follow in her turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend my condolences to her partner, her children and her grandchild. May her legacy inspire us to continue to fight discrimination in all its forms, and may her memory be a blessing to us all. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Susan Ryan was the first in her family and the first in her school to win a scholarship to go to the University of Sydney. She studied education and, like many women of that generation, expected to go on to a career in teaching. After graduating, she married public servant, and later diplomat, Richard Butler. She recalled, 'Because of this, I lost my scholarship and had to pay back the scholarship money,' and she noted that this wouldn't have happened had she been a man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1965, they moved to Canberra. For the next six years, she was active in the ACT, becoming a founding member of the wonderful Belconnen sub-branch of the Labor Party. She spent two periods living overseas when Butler was posted first to Vienna and then to New York. There, she was influenced, as Christine Wallace has noted, by the work of Kate Millett and Betty Friedanâ€”and, of course, Germaine Greer was then part of the mix, along with Gloria Steinem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan returned to Canberra in 1971 with her two children but without Butler, who she divorced the following year. She became involved with the Women's Electoral Lobby and continued her activism with the Labor Party while completing her master's degree at the Australian National University and being employed as the head of the Australian Council of State School Organisations. She was elected to the non-governing ACT House of Assembly in 1975 and ran unsuccessfully in 1974 for preselection for the electorate of Fraser, which I had the honour to represent as the last member for the then ACT electorate of Fraser prior to the creation of the Victorian electorate of the same name. She was defeated by Ken Fry but won preselection as the Labor candidate for the Senate in 1975. She ran under the fabulous slogan 'A woman's place is in the Senate,' but her timing was unfortunate in that her election coincided with the dismissal of the Whitlam government. She told journalists that she:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ would never have cracked pre-selection in the heavily factionalised NSW branch of the ALP, and owed much to the ACT branch's more open and flexible attitude towards a 33 year old single mother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her trailblazing was recognised in the ACT following her death by a wonderful cadre of feminists who acknowledged her prominence and her role as a standard-bearer for a broad movement of resolute and sophisticated change-makers. She was remarkable because she expressed the wisdom and conviction of her peers, many of whom still inspire the current ACT Labor team and whose values are embodied in our progressive and egalitarian ACT Labor branch.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her work was in so many fields. In the Sex Discrimination Act, she reshaped a nation for the better. As Susan Ryan recalled, prior to that act:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ it was not unlawful to sack women who married or became pregnant, or just because they were women. Maternity leave was scarcely available. Women could not get home loans. Girls' education was restricted and fewer girls got into higher education. Much of our community thought all of this was OK.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She endured ferocious political attacks but managed to continue without losing that sense of optimism and idealism. She didn't become hardened or embittered by the attacks. She simply carried on in her wonderful Susan Ryan way. As Chief Minister Andrew Barr has noted:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ she will be fondly remembered by those who knew her, and those that are continuing the fight for Labor values today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague Senator Katy Gallagher has noted, she was 'an incredible support for so many of us who have followed in her footsteps'. Destroy the Joint supporter Sarah Jeffery said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I saw her speak in parliament in 1983 on a school excursion to Canberra. She was impressive. I remember being shocked by the abuse and ridicule she received from the rows of men in opposition. She just kept talking. I was 15 and she made a huge impact on me. I have always been grateful for her legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ in 1984 my sister, as a young Engineering Survey Draftsperson, kept a copy of the Anti Discrimination Act displayed prominently on her desk, so coworkers didn't say she was taking a job away from a man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Susan Ryan received an honorary doctorate from the Australian National University for her work to advance human rights, the MeToo movement was emerging and she saw an opportunity to push against obstacles that should never have existed but still did. As she told <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Canberra Times</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ I feel more than disappointed, deeply distressed that women are still battling things that they shouldn't have to battle.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She campaigned on age discrimination and on disability discrimination and she pushed the frontiers in so many important ways. One of the great reforms for which she has largely gone unheralded was the campaign from the Women's Electoral Lobby in the ACT submitting to the Tariff Board in the 1970s that the tariff on contraceptives be reduced. I, as a free-trading feminist myself, can think of no better reform to be championing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  Susan Ryan was a force for good, a go-getter, a person who broke down barriers, with an infectious passion for progress. Susan made life better for so many Australians, particularly women. She will be sadly missed. Susan, just like me, grew up in Maroubra, and she never lost her love of the surf, the ocean and the rolling waves, particularly of her home beach of Maroubra. It's no coincidence that the last thing that Susan did on this planet was go for a swim in the ocean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan attended Brigidine College at Randwick, the same school that my wife went to and the same school that my eldest daughter will begin high school at next year. After travelling the world with her diplomat husband, Susan settled down in Canberra in the early 1970s. Her passion, her intellect and her talent were quickly recognised, and she was elected to the ACT House of Assembly. In 1975 she ran for one of the first two Senate spots for the ACT. She ran under the slogan 'A woman's place is in the Senate,' and she was spot-on. When she got to the Senate, she made sure that she delivered on her campaign slogan, setting quickly about reforming outdated laws and ensuring equality for women in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1983, on the election of the Hawke Labor government, Susan was appointed as the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. It was in that latter portfolio where she really made a difference and quickly set about changing Australian society and ensuring greater equality and fairness and the removal of discrimination against women. She set about breaking down some of those discriminatory mores that existed in our society at the time. She established the Sex Discrimination Act, the equal employment opportunity for women principles and the Public Sector Reform Act. These legal reforms introduced long-overdue changes to Australia that were, at the time, opposed by some in our society but ensured that Australia moved in line with international conventions that we were signatory to around the rights of women. Those reforms ensured that it became illegal for a woman to be sacked from her job simply for falling pregnant. They made it illegal for women to be discriminated against in the workplace. They made sexual harassment in the workplace unlawful and ensured extra funding and support for working women through child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Susan introduced these reforms, of course there was the typical opposition from business groups and from family groups and, indeed, from some within her own party, the Labor Party, and certainly from many in the coalition, on the conservative side of politics, at the time. These were predictable argumentsâ€”that the reforms would destroy business and that they would destroy the nature of the family unit and Australian society. Susan clinically and quickly dismissed all of those arguments and pointed out the benefits that would flow to Australia for women, for our society and for our economy from these reforms. And, indeed, she has been proven right. For my generation, when we look back it's almost unthinkable that that's how we existed at that time and that anyone could oppose a reform that ensured that a woman couldn't be sacked from her job for falling pregnant. Susan fought hard and she won those battles and she gave those rights to women, and our country is better for her tenacity and for her powerful advocacy. As the father of four daughters, I sincerely thank Susan for leading the way and breaking down those barriers and ensuring that my daughters, and thousands of other women throughout the country, can live with dignity and respect in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After parliament, Susan never lost her passion for progress and equality, and she became the pro-vice-chancellor of the University of New South Wales in my electorate, in the community that she lived in, and she was the president of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. We all know that she continued in the role of breaking down the barriers, in 2011 becoming the Age Discrimination Commissioner and in 2014 the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. She never stopped fighting for the rights of the marginalised. Susan was very proud of her Irish descent, and that descent made her a very proud and staunch Australian republican. She was at one stage the national director of the Australian Republic Movement. I often had great conversations with Susan about the importance of Australia recognising our independence and our identity and finally having one of our own as our head of state. It was great to see her speak last year at Old Parliament House on the 20th anniversary of the failed 1999 republic referendum and to see that she hadn't lost that passion for this important issue. Hopefully, one day we can get around to finally voting on becoming a republic and having one of our own as our head of state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I thank Susan for her wonderful contribution to Australian life. Australia is a better community, a better country, because of the work that she undertook. She leaves a great legacy of equality and justice. And for that, we thank her. I offer my sincere commiserations to her partner, Rory, and her children.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  'I know what you're thinkingâ€”I'm old, very old. And you might be wondering: how did I get to be so lucky?' This is a quote from a video called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Power of Oldness</span>, a campaign undertaken by Susan Ryan when she was Age Discrimination Commissioner. It is an upbeat video, showing a gentleman with grey hair participating, contributing, and showing off his wisdom and skills. It's typical of the positivity and optimism that Susan Ryan brought to everything she did. But the video ends with a harsh dose of reality. The man walks into a starkly lit room, clearly having a job interview. He no longer looks confident and seems to have aged. A young woman clearly in recruitment or HR says, 'I'm sorry. We're looking for someone younger.' Susan Ryan knew all too well that age discrimination was real and was holding this nation back. I had the privilege of getting to know Susan when I was the shadow minister for ageing. She was so generous with her time and her ideas and sage advice. I will never forget our one-on-one meetings, where she would offer up her wisdom on ageing, aged care and the rights of older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragic part of all this is she passed away too soon. On 10 October she would have turned 78 years of age, well short of the median life expectancy of 84 to 85 years of age for a woman of her era. Don't get me wrongâ€”Susan Ryan lived a full and bountiful life. She achieved a great deal throughout her time. She was an educator, a scholar and a political campaigner. She was a foundation member of the Women's Electoral Lobby in the early 1970s, a body that promotes women's issues to political candidates and mobilised women's political power. She can be credited in large part with our victory in 1972. She was immensely proud of the work she did in that campaign. In 1975 she was elected, as my colleagues have said, as one of two senators for the ACT, on the slogan 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' Under Prime Minister Bob Hawke, she served as Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. We know she was instrumental in the implementation of the Sex Discrimination Act, the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, the Public Service Reform Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act. Even with all these great achievements for women, former Prime Minister Paul Keating said her greatest achievement in the education portfolio was lifting the year 12 retention rate from three in 10 to nine in 10 for young people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After leaving politics, she contributed immensely to Australian political life, in superannuation, in industry and in academia. In July 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed her as the inaugural Age Discrimination Commissioner with the Australian Human Rights Commission. It was during this time she worked alongside other warriors in the field, including Everald Compton and former Labor Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe, and contributed to the Gillard government's Advisory Panel on Positive Ageing. She contributed numerous policy papers addressing age discrimination in the workplace, the insurance industry and housing, just to name a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Advisory Panel on Positive Ageing was a permanent panel within the Treasury, directly advising then Treasurer Wayne Swan and working with the department to address the ageing of our population. Tragically, in a moment of partisan madness, the former Liberal Treasurer Joe Hockey sacked the panel in December 2013, just six months shy of its delivering a blueprint for an ageing Australia. With the panel forced to find private funding to complete its work, Susan Ryan's work became merely consulting. Not long after that, the Abbott government chose not to appoint a new Disability Discrimination Commissioner, rather making Susan Ryan both Age and Disability Discrimination Commissioner. I know for a fact she loved to work in disability, but she was frustrated to think the government might consider ageing a type of disability. The Labor opposition at the time promised her that we would reinstate a stand-alone discrimination commissioner for ageing and one for disability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan's passion meant she was determined to keep the nation focused on population changes coming our way. As the Abbott government planned to increase the working age to 70, there were major shifts to be made on how we address mature-age workers. Apart from the discrimination of companies looking to recruit younger people, the insurance industry made it even harder. Mature workers couldn't be covered by workers compensation, let alone access private life and disability insurance. She made great inputs into policy in this area. Most notably, she developed and helped us with the development of policy for mature-age workers. She understood the need to retrain and support workers as they reached the age of 50 years. She actually inspired me to consider a coordinated approach to assist people from the age of 50 to access career advice and support, like an employment check-up, and to reinvigorate the Corporate Champions program. Unfortunately, our nation has not embraced the need for age-friendly communities in a way that Susan foresaw. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was a dear friend of the former member for Oxley, former Labor leader, Treasurer, foreign affairs minister and Governor-General, Bill Hayden. Bill has been like a mentor to me and a giver of sage advice. Bill and his wife, Dallas, had known Susan for decades, and their daughters worked together briefly. Every year the member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard, stages the Hayden Oration in honour of Bill Hayden. In 2019, Bill chose Susan Ryan to deliver that speech, just 13 months ago. It was the last time I had a really good opportunity to speak with her in depth. She spoke of the reforms undertaken by the Whitlam and Hawke governments and Bill's role in that. She was as passionate last year as she was in the 1970s. Let me quote from her speech at that Hayden Oration: 'It is Labor that provides reform in governments. Our opponents do not. They aim to maintain the status quo. Because of this necessary focus on reform, Labor governments typically experience much tougher electoral climates than our opponents. People fear change, and reform necessitates change. Voter fear gives the conservatives fuel for their fear campaigns. Nothing changes here, as Labor's disappointment in the 2019 election demonstrates.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It saddens me to think Susan Ryan is no longer with us to provide that advice and inspiration. But one thing about her life is her work towards equality. In that oration she talked about the fact that in 1977 Bill Hayden made her the Labor spokesperson for communications, media and the arts. 'In 1979 he added the status of women to my responsibilities,' she said. It was one of the most important decisions any Labor leader had ever made. 'It was my portfolio from that time until I retired from parliament in 1988,' she said. She kept it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the 1977 election result, another disastrous result for Labor, Bill decided to have an inquiry, with Neal Blewett and John Button to head up the inquiry. For the first time Labor decided to get submissions from young Labor women on the history of women's votes. Such an exercise was novel, according to Susan. It was thought, by the way, that women would follow the voting decisions of their husbands. 'Not so,' she said. Armed with this startling and persuasive data, and with Bill Hayden's support, she said: 'I set out on a long process of developing women's policy for Labor. This process involved consulting women's organisations of all kinds and individual women as far as possible. This activity resulted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards equality</span>, a document setting out a raft of detailed policies designed to overcome the social and economic disadvantages experienced by women. In 1982, Bill as Labor leader wrote a foreword to the document and launched it.' And so it goes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also went on to make this very important comment: 'In 1983, the election marked the first time more women than men voted for Labor. As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women I had a big agenda.' It was that <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards equality</span> agenda that she had, and a lot of election commitments were undertaken based on the Bill Hayden document. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really saddens to see that she's no longer with us when you consider what she did. I want to finish with this statement from Bill Hayden. He sent this to me today. He asked that I read it. I think it's a fitting way to conclude. It shows all about Susan, her mentoring role to young women, and it sets out something about her. She gave Bill 36, the second-top grade for any Labor politician going into the 1972 election. Gough Whitlam got 33. Bill was seen as more pro-women's-rights than Gough. The only person above in all the parliament was Tom Uren. I think the Leader of the Opposition would be delighted about that. He got 37. Andrew Peacock got 30, but a lot of his colleagues were negative, according to the Women's Electoral Lobby in 1972. She would have been shocked when Bill said this. This is the statement from Bill. I will read it entirely:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the news of Susan's death was broadcast of the ABC radio news Sunday week ago, my elder daughter Georgina came and told me about the news flash. I was absolutely devastated because Susan and I had been good friends. We sat beside each other in the Cabinet and we would often chat about personal matters like family. On one occasion, not long after our youngest daughter Ingrid started high school, I told Susan that I was worried Ingrid was not doing as well academically as I believed she could and I was thinking perhaps of getting Ingrid apprenticed in a hair dressing salon. Susan expostulated loudlyâ€”</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">you can just imagine her doing thatâ€”</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Predictably, she gave me a very firm talk about liberation for women. Susan knew Ingrid well as she did all our children from their coming to Parliament House since they were very young. Susan said the future for Ingrid as for all women was through education; Susan said: she can do it; she is bright and able. Susan was right. After a change of school environment Ingrid flourished going on to obtain an accounting degree at the University of Queensland, becoming a member of the Chartered Accountants Association after successfully sitting their rigorous exam, and now close to thirty years distinguished service with the United Nations including serving administratively in UN peace keeping missions including in Cambodia, Timor Leste, Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Chad, South Sudan and Darfur Sudan where she administered military peace-keeping forces from Nigeria and Thailand, and currently, following her appointment by the Secretary-General of the UN in 2018, Ingrid is serving as the Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to the UN's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and does reporting for the UN Security Council and has appeared before it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These things came as a direct result of Susan Ryan's intervention in the Cabinet Office against my thinking, so I am eternally grateful to Susan. Throughout the intervening years, Susan would often enquire how Ingrid was getting on; Susan's interest was genuine. Among my very many fond memories was Susan's uninhibited penchant for singing Irish songs with gustoâ€”and as in her approach to those who opposed her on women's rights issues Susan annihilated the uncooperative notes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">I am extremely grateful to Susan Ryan and miss her. Vale Susan Ryan.    </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Bill Hayden, 'Amen to that.' Susan, your legacy was to lead Australia, in your words, 'towards equality'. Our country owes you so much. My deepest condolences to your family and friends.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="102376" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Much has been written and said about the great Susan Ryan since she passed away. Universally she's been described as a genuine trailblazer and a champion for women. She was highly astute and wily when she needed to be, and she proved time and time again she had the bravery and fortitude to take on a system in her quest for fairness and equality. It's clear also that she wasn't the sort of person who was easily shocked. But back in 1962, when the then 20-year-old Susan married a junior diplomat called Richard Butler, she was astounded to discover that this might bring about the end of her then fledgling career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was the first person in her family to win a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she studied education. But, after getting married, she lost her scholarship and had to pay back all of the payments she'd received from the Department of Education. She recalled at an interview in 2012: 'It didn't happen to the blokes. When I tell that story today, young women think that I am making it up, and well they might.' Sadly, that was the way things were in Australia in the 1960s. Until 1967, when a woman got married she had to resign from her job in the Commonwealth Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Ryan entered politics and became a minister in the Hawke government in 1983, it was still entirely lawful for a woman to be sacked for being married or being pregnant. Susan and Richard divorced in the early seventies, and he went on to become a United Nations weapon inspector. Susan, meanwhile, became highly engaged in politics, emerging as a feminist leader and a founder of the Women's Electoral Lobby in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the age of just 33, she was elected to the Senate at the same election at which the Labor Party suffered a landslide defeat after the dismissal of the Whitlam government. The year was 1975, and she was just one of six women in federal parliamentâ€”only six! Interest was high in the young feminist's election to the male-dominated parliament. Media stories at the time included comments on her gender, age, hair, clothing, marital status and the fact she was a single mum to two children, the type of reflection today's members and senators sadly still see repeatedâ€”perhaps not so often, though.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When she sought Labor pre-selection, she was referred to in one report as 'the attractive 32-year-old mother-of-two, a divorcee'. In another she was 'tall, slight, with green eyes and chestnut brown hair and an Irish face'. In her maiden speech, which we now call the first speech, she noted that as a female parliamentarian she was a member of a particularly small minority group. And I note happily this week that the Senate achieved a record 42 per cent female representation with the swearing in of Senator Lidia Thorpe. Susan Ryan would be proud of this development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as she was in parliament, Susan showed she was there to make a difference, launching headlong into work on serious policy reform and gaining the respect of the Labor caucus. During this period she also set up a Labor national Women's Policy Committee and travelled around Australia to improve women's understanding of the party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Bill Hayden became Labor leader in 1977, Susan Ryan was handed the shadow portfolios of communications, the arts and the media, making her the first woman on Labor's federal frontbench. In 1983, when Bob Hawke regained power for Labor, she was made education minister and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. She was Labor's first female cabinet member, an historic title she will carry forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan's exceptional achievement of course came in 1984 with the passage of the Sex Discrimination Actâ€”among the most comprehensive pieces of legislation of its kind in the world. That act made it illegal to discriminate against women in employment based on their marital status or pregnancy. More than 20 years after she lost her scholarship at the University of Sydney simply for getting married, Susan Ryan righted many wrongs. She ended the systematic, embedded and overt discrimination that held women and girls back so that the power of the patriarchy, the power of men, could continue without challenge. Susan Ryan challenged the power that held the sisterhood down and she won. The Sex Discrimination Act also outlawed sexual harassment in the workplace. Until then, women who dared to complain had no recourse. Mostly, they were told they would just have to put up with it. Standing here almost four decades later, it is bewildering to recall that those reforms were opposed by many in our society, particularly community conservative groups and some politicians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was labelled Australia's 'feminist dictator' and was the target of a 'Stop the Ryan juggernaut' rally, organised by Fred and Elaine Nile. If only she could have been a feminist dictator, equality for women may actually have happened by now. Reform can be difficult and Susan never wavered, and we feminists today, those who believe in the equality of women, must never waver. We must always continue her fight and the fight of so many others to ensure true equality for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan's other great passion was education. Under her watch, year 12 retention rates doubled and participation in TAFEs and universities improved markedly. One of my predecessors in the seat of Brand, Wendy Fatin, was the first woman from WA to be a member of the House of Representatives. Wendy served alongside Susan Ryan in the Hawke and Keating ministries and, like Susan, she was passionate about women's issues. In fact, she was appointed in 1990 as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, the role Susan held for five years, until 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After leaving politics, Susan did not give up on social change, serving as Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner and later as Disability Discrimination Commissioner. Just weeks before her death, she was speaking out in the media against the horrendous conditions in the nation's aged-care homes. Susan Ryan was a true pioneer for women in this country. She was a progressive who was full of energy and ideas and, above all, she was effective. She was a proud feminist. I am a proud feminist. Labor women, myself included, owe Susan an enormous debt of gratitude. She blazed the trail that we're all following. Thank you, Susan. You will be remembered as a truly great Australian.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  It is an incredible honour to be able to stand in the Australian parliament and speak on this condolence motion for Susan Ryan and to follow so many of my Labor comrades in reflections on her extraordinary life and extraordinary contribution to Australian society. She was many things and it is very difficult to contain them to just a series of adjectives, but she was an absolutely proud feminist. The member for Brand made that point very clear. It was really the hard-slog work of women like Susan Ryan that paved the way so that all of the Labor women you see before you today can stand in this parliament. A lot of my colleagues made note of the fact that her first election slogan, which was one that she carried for many years, was 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' Later in life, I remember a conversation with her where she said, 'We need you in the House, in the Senate and, indeed, in all realms of politics where decisions are being made. We need feminists in those positions'â€”women who appreciate the structural inequalities that continue to exist in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we rightly praise Susan for the role that she played in leading the changes that were quite radical for Australia at the time and culminated in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Susan faced a number of rejections of that bill before getting to that point. By 1984 there was a certain level of maturity and an understanding of some of those issues. Australia had just signed the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the Sex Discrimination Act was the perfect measure for the implementation of that international commitment here in Australia. If Susan Ryan had done nothing else in her life, that one piece of legislation would have been a most important contribution. It changed the lives of Australian women forever and in a very good way. It is really very difficult to imagine what life was like for women prior to that piece of legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague from Brand made reference to the extraordinary lived experience that Susan brought to the Senate. She was a brilliant scholar. She trained to be a teacher and had a Commonwealth funded scholarship to undertake her studies. Then she got married, and, for this 'wrongdoing', she was asked to repay it. She had already graduated with her degree. She had already graduated, but she was asked to repay the Commonwealth scholarship because she was now a married womanâ€”and we couldn't possibly be supporting married women, because their place was definitely not, at that point, in this House or in the Senate. I guess it is little wonder that Susan Ryan, having lived through that experience, came to the Senate with a fire in her belly to ensure that she would never be silent when she confronted discrimination against women in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, she tried to get that bill passed through the Australian parliament as a private member's bill originally. One of the great strengths of Susan Ryan was that she was a collaborative worker and she really didn't have a lot of time for the factional divisions that often take up a lot of time in this establishment. She didn't have much time for that. She reached out across political parties to try and get the job done. She had an appreciation that she had a certain amount of time in this place, and she was going to make a difference. She didn't waste her time. Having been defeated in her efforts to get a sex discrimination act across the line with a private member's bill, she waited and waited and worked across the aisles and got people engaged in that process and did what women are exceptionally good at doing, and that is actually bringing people together to make things happen. She got that Sex Discrimination Act passed through parliament, and we all remain so very deeply thankful for her persistence and her dogged determination there. Had she not been the brilliant feminist, the great scholar, the great visionary and the pragmatic warrior that she was, we might not have seen that piece of legislation in Australia.</span>

                  </a>  You can hop out of the chair. I reckon Susan Ryan would be honoured that I managed to stop the Australian parliament for a brief moment in order to make this further contribution to her life, and it was a bloke that we had to give permission to to leave the chamber! She would like that. She would have a smile on her face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to offer two very personal recollections of Susan, and they are of my last two meetings with her. One was at an anniversary for WEL, Women's Electoral Lobby, which she was a founding member of. It was an important anniversary for WEL, at Sydney. We were gathered in the Sydney Town Hall, and all of the amazing women of her generation and her era were gathered in the room. What a powerhouse of feminists. I walked in in awe of all the women that were gathered there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan ran a punishing kind of life and set herself so many goalsâ€”to still be rallying against injustice wherever she found it and certainly trying to find remedies for gender inequality wherever she found it. She would probably be offended, almost, by my statement saying that she was still running a hectic legislative and reform program to the very end, because she would say to you: 'What the hell? Don't expect me to be retiring and playing bridge here. That is not what I do! Why would you be shocked that I'm still a reformist to the day I die?' Literally, I know she was on that phone, ringing many of my colleagues, with her outrage and her deep concern about what was happening in aged care in Australia. So it was terrific to catch up with Susan at the Sydney Town Hall. She was there with all her colleagues, and it was a real night to remember. You were reminded, in a very tangible way, of the debt you owe to those women that go before us and pave the way for us to be here to be able to speak in this House today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another moment that I want to reflect on. I'm very thankful to the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, for organising a Status of Women committee one night for Labor women here in this House. We were gathered in the member for Sydney's office, and Susan came to brief us with her enormous skills and expertise that she had attained as Australia's inaugural Age Discrimination Commissioner with the Human Rights Commission. Susan was there to ensure that we younger Labor women had a very sound understanding of the needs of older women in Australia and the crisis that was looming in terms of issues around safety and housing for women in Australia. I must say, I am now on an inquiry regarding homelessness and housing in Australia and another inquiry examining domestic and family violence in Australia, and Susan Ryan's words of wisdom are with me on each and every day that I sit in those inquiries. I am eternally grateful for her taking time to tutor younger women coming through. She had a very generous spirit and was deeply committed to mentoring and training, and that remained part of the gift that she gave to all of us Labor women coming through behind her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was gutted when I heard of Susan's death. I was really shocked. I had no sense that she was anywhere near passing from this world. As I said, she was a feisty feminist warrior each and every time I encountered her. I will always remember her in that light and remain eternally grateful for what she did in her life for all of us and for what she did later in life in making sure that those of us coming behind her were well schooled in the history of the struggle for gender equality in Australia and for the rights of older Australians and, indeed, that we remain dogged in our pursuit of injustice wherever we might find it. Vale, Susan Ryan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion of condolence for Susan Ryan AO, and I'm proud to follow the member for Newcastle, who is walking in those footsteps. It is a cliche to say that Susan Ryan was a trailblazer, but, for someone that does hiking, the trailblazer makes it easier for all those that come after them. They mark a trail and say, 'You can come this way; I have made it easier for you.' Susan Ryan certainly achieved great things for women and for Australia as that trailblazer. Someone always needs to step up first and to go out in areas that are perhaps unknown to achieve that progress for all. Being the first woman around a Labor cabinet table was a remarkable achievement, and obviously Susan has paved the way for many others. Some might say too few, but certainly in Labor we are doing our bit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was an incredible leaderâ€”as an advocate for women's issues, as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the Hawke government, and, in later life, as an advocate for older women when she became the Age Discrimination Commissioner from 2011. That's the capacity in which I first met her. Through her leadership, Susan changed our country for the better. It is no coincidence that, during Susan's time in government, great advances towards equality were made and, most importantly, have mostly held up firm. Susan introduced the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984, giving women equal rights in the workforce for the first timeâ€”no more getting sacked for getting married or falling pregnant or the like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women make up half our population, and they need to be involved in decisions that affect their lives. They need to make decisions that affect their lives. When women are absent from the decision-making table, it should be no shock that the decisions that are made without them will negatively impact on women. Susan led by example, and women have followed her, particularly in the Labor movement. I'm very proud that 47 per cent of our federal Labor caucus are women. Unfortunately, we're not in government, and the current government benches seem to be a little bit bereft of womenâ€”and this matters, because we know that, for young girls, if you can't see it, you can't be it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After seven years of conservative governments, the lives of Australian women have, sadly, worsened. It's easy to see after last night's budget that things have worsened. In 2013, Australia was ranked 23rd in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Reportâ€”not good enough, you might sayâ€”when measuring the gap between men and women in health, education, work and politics. Last year, we slipped back to 44th out of 153 countriesâ€”and you would be embarrassed to see the countries that are ahead of us. So we are sliding backwards, and we've seen no improvement from the Morrison government. Last night's budget left women out almost completely. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the reason the Morrison government's policies are heavily weighted against the interests of Australian women is that the government's cabinet table is dominated by men. In fact, the Morrison government's very important Expenditure Review Committeeâ€”the one overseeing all government spendingâ€”is made up entirely of men. This is at a time when women need solutions to the systemic problems that Susan Ryan fought against so oftenâ€”systemic problems such as women over the age of 55 being the fastest-growing group of homeless Australians, and 40 per cent of older single retired women living in poverty. That is an obscene statistic in 2020. That's a shameful legacy for this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Encouraging women into the workforce is good for the economy and it is good for women. So why does child care in Australia cost between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the average household income, when the average in the OECD is just 11 per cent? The current Child Care Subsidy scheme, introduced by then Minister Morrison as social services minister, is one of the most expensive in the world. As Treasurer, now Prime Minister Morrison voted eight times for cuts to penalty rates. Women make up the majority of workers in retail and accommodation, where those penalty rate cuts have hit the hardest. Cutting penalty rates has made it harder for these women to put food on the table and pay the rent and has exacerbated the gender pay gap that Susan Ryan fought so hard to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of policy that will improve the outcomes for women, we have seen policy half-measures, like allowing women to raid their superannuation to escape family violence. Susan Ryan knew of this and campaigned and lobbied Labor members, as we heard from the member for Newcastle, almost to the day that she died. She knew the importance of women being able to safely flee from family violence. We also know that women already retire with significantly less superannuation than men. This policy will only increase their chances of poverty or homelessness in later years. Instead of implementing any of the multitude of recommendations from recent reports and inquiries which could be protecting women right now, the Morrison government has launched yet another parliamentary inquiry into the family law system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education was also something that Susan Ryan knew the benefit of. The government's university funding reform, supposedly designed to increase enrolments in STEM subjects, will mean students wanting to study humanities subjects, predominantly female students, will be paying more than double for their degrees. All these policy decisions matter. There should be people like Susan Ryan sitting around the cabinet table who can raise these issues. We know that women are going to bear the brunt of the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's stimulus response has a clear bias towards male-dominated sectors such as construction, rather than any feminised part of the workforce, and so it goes on. When strong women like Susan Ryan speak up, and when they're in leadership roles, progressive societies can be lulled into a false sense of security. Susan was a strong leader, and other women have followed in her large footsteps, but the current government has not prioritised women in its leadership at all. At best, women are an afterthought and, at worst, they are discriminated against by deliberate policy decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues we stand up for, more than just the roles we play, are who we really are. Susan Ryan made it very clear who she was from the very moment she entered public life, and Susan did not waver. She was an inspiration not just for Labor women but for Labor men as well. She advocated for what she believed in for her entire life. Susan Ryan gave her all to this country. Her passing is a terrible loss, but she leaves a lasting legacy. Women will continue to follow in her footsteps, and that will make this country a better place. I'm going to finish with the 'Irish Blessing', which Susan Ryan knew so well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Susan Ryan and I left Parliament Houseâ€”the Old Parliament Houseâ€”and politics within days of each other in January 1988. I left for New York. She left for the world of publishing. I'd had the good fortune to watch her closely over her previous three years of being a minister, when I was a young journalist in the press gallery. I arrived at the start of 1985, and, as a junior reporter in the 2UE network's bureau, I was tasked with covering the Senate! That meant, every question time, I was sitting above the Senate in the old parliamentâ€”which felt a lot closer than the distance we feel now between us and the press galleryâ€”and I watched the second Hawke ministry in action. On the other side was Senator Fred Chaney leading the opposition team. On the government side was Senator John Button. And Susan Ryan very clearly held her own amongst that team, including Gareth Evansâ€”and I should be able to rattle off a whole lot of names in the Senate at that time. They were an amazing mob to watch. But, of course, Susan Ryan stood out because she was the lone female there on the front bench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, I don't think I realised the significance of her being there. She'd already been there for three years, and, prior to that, prior to being the first female federal Minister for Education and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, she'd been the first woman senator for the ACT. She'd been the first woman on Labor's federal frontbench, appointed by Bill Hayden in opposition. And she, as I say, had spent a term there, so she was part of the team. The Sex Discrimination Act had been passed the year before I arrived in Canberra, and so the challenges it faced along the way were lost on me. It was in law, and, as a young woman, that seemed absolutely right to me. I want to take you back to that timeâ€”and there are enough grey hairs in this chamber right now to remember some of those days. This was a time when the surname of Templeman was considered a symbol of gender inequality. My fellow gallery journos joked about changing it to Templewoman, but they settled on Templeperson, and I'm still known by that to this day by older, most of them ex-, gallery journos. That's the era we were in, and that's the era in which she fought her biggest battles. When I look back on this, I can now see what an enormous challenge it must have been for Susan Ryan in bringing forward such landmark legislation. It does seem unbelievable now that it was not unlawful to sack women who married or became pregnant or simply because they were women. Sadly, not even today is it unbelievable that someone might want to do it, but it's incomprehensible that the law would provide no impediment to it. Susan Ryan's fight for women to have maternity leave or to be able get a home loan in their own name and for girls to have an equal opportunity to have a higher educationâ€”all things she oversaw improvements inâ€”would have been hard-fought battles. There are still many of those areas where we need to keep progressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having witnessed the treatment of a female Prime Minister many years later in this country, it's no surprise that Susan faced exceptionally stiff opposition to her Sex Discrimination Actâ€”but she withstood that opposition and she got that made into law. She stood out in a very male-dominated chamber. On the floor, her intelligence, her competence and very often her wit would shine through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her respect for me as a young journalist was evident in the way she responded to questions in media conferences. Her press secretary, Greg Holland, would talk me through issues about which I had little background, and we didn't have the benefit of Google in those days. I covered mainly the issues around education, and we cannot forget how she doubled the number of girls who would complete high school in those yearsâ€”a phenomenal achievement. Unlike some ministers at the timeâ€”and I won't name namesâ€”I always knew a media conference with Senator Ryan would be to the point, would give me a grab and would turn complex education policy into something useable. I was grateful for that. She and Democrat Janine Haines, who was first deputy leader and then leader of the Democrats, were the two women in that chamber who demonstrated to me, simply by going about their jobs, that women did belong in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I can't claim to have known Susan Ryan well at that time in the 1980s, I was really grateful to cross paths with her decades later when I became a Labor candidate. As I've heard it said already this afternoon, she was very generous with her time and in talking through issues. She was still, at that time, fighting for fairness, and I think she did that until her very last day. She was Age Discrimination Commissioner and then, obviously, Disability Discrimination Commissioner at the Human Rights Commission. In more sociable environments, such as the Irish Friends of Labor, we got to see her warmth and her love of a song. She was always warm and always welcoming to me as a younger Labor woman coming forward. What she achieved changed the expectations that women could have, especially in the workforce, and for that we should all be very grateful. I'm certainly honoured to have known her a little bit during her life, and I'm very pleased to pay tribute to her today. Vale, Susan Maree Ryan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  My first memory of Susan Ryan is of when I was invited to a Young Labor function when I was about 19 years of age. It was hosted by John Dawkins, who had been a colleague of Susan Ryan. A number of us Young Labor people got together and got to know Susan Ryan. I have to say, there's a rumour that young people can party harder than older people. That certainly wasn't the case that night! We were very much left behind. It was a wonderful night, but certainly what first struck me about Susan Ryan was her vitality, her passion, her commitment to the Labor cause and her enjoyment of a good time. But I don't think I understood the impact that she had had that night, really. I was pretty young, and the history of the Labor movement was not something I was studying at university.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my 21st birthday I got her autobiography as a gift. I read that autobiography, and it was only then that I appreciated the enormous contribution that Susan Ryan had made while in parliament as a Labor minister and as a senator for the ACT. As a 21-year-old, it did strike me as quite strange that someone who was at university, who had their whole life ahead of themâ€”something my parents never, ever spoke to me about was getting married or finding a partner; all they wanted me to do was to get a good education and get a good job. For me, it never struck me that, if I were to get married or if I were to have a child, my path would somehow be changed. That had never crossed my mind until I read that book and realised that there were generations of women that had had those barriers put in front of them, and it was people like Senator Susan Ryan leading the charge to take those barriers away. It was a seminal book for me, paired with the wonderful, vital woman that I'd met at that party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking at that legacy, it is a huge legacy. 'A woman's place is in the Senate' in 1975â€”winning in that election. It would have been a very difficult time to have won and made that momentous individual achievement but, at the same time, lose a Labor government. It needs to be recognised that, during that time, despite losing a Labor government, she was only one of the two first senators to represent the ACT, and the first woman and the first Labor representative for the ACT in the Senate. She was the 11th woman to be elected to the Senate. Prior to her election to the Senate, she served in the non-governing ACT Advisory Council, briefly representing the ACT seat of Fraser. She had a significant career, spanning 12 years, and, following her election in our country's 28th election, she was re-elected to the Senate a further five times. This was a significant milestone. But not only was it her length in the Senate that is so important; it's the contribution she made hereâ€”and her contribution was significant. Whether it came to youth representation or whether it came to education, she made incredibly important achievements in these portfolios, including the increased retention of year 12s. But she also, of course, as many speakers have said before, introduced the private member's motion in 1981 that was the foundation for the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984. So, even within, she was advocating. She was pushing the boundaries and trying to get change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2003, Susan Ryan addressed the Australian Women Speak conference in Canberra. She said: 'We can celebrate progress, sometimes glacially slow, sometimes faltering, towards the implied if not said objective of those that framed the Australian Constitution. This objective, as I infer it, is the participation by women fully, on an equal basis with men, in our political institutions.' She proved to me, as well as to many others, that this could happen. She often said that what spurred her on to effect the change of the Sex Discrimination Act was when she experienced herself her prospects as an educator being ripped away following her decision to marry. From that, she then continued to advocate for change. I think that change has certainly led the way for people like me to be in parliament. But also, when I was at uni, all those many, many years ago, it never crossed my mind that my decision to get married, or who my father was or who my husband was, would have any implications for my prospects. It never crossed my mind that that would be the case. Only a few decades ago it would have been, and Susan Ryan changed thatâ€”and I am absolutely forever grateful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After that infamous Young Labor gathering, I didn't see Susan for many years. Upon being elected to this place, I did have the absolute honour of talking to her about age discrimination, particularly older workers, who she was very passionate about changing the prospects forâ€”older women and men that found themselves unable to get into the workplace. Her passion just continued to be there for those older workers, particularly older women, who she saw as incredibly vulnerable as time went on, especially where they may have been in a partnership and may have been making sacrifices, not working as much, certainly not accumulating superannuation, certainly not in a higher-paying job, and then, if divorce were to happen, being left out on their own and having no real ability to regain those losses. She was incredibly passionate about that. She worked against disability discrimination as well and did an amazing job in that role as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So her contribution to public service, both within government and within the discrimination commission structure and in her general private advocacy, is much to be admired. Many of us can only hope that we have as much of a life and make as much of a contribution as Susan Ryan did. I think we all hope and aspireâ€”I certainly doâ€”to be able to leave a mark by making things better for those that come after us. So I would like to thank her for that and recognise the huge amount of amazing contributions she made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an aside, I might say that, in an interview, she did mention that the reintroduction of higher education fees was something that made her leave politics. As I said at the beginning, the gathering was hosted by the person that came after her in education, the Hon. John Dawkins, so they had clearly made up, because they did enjoy that night together and they seemed to be very good friends. Despite her anger at that, I saw no animosity that night, and they had clearly made up. Vale, Susan Ryan. We all hope that we can achieve as much as she did to pave the way for others, to eliminate discrimination and to allow those that are most vulnerable to reach their opportunity. Vale, Susan Ryan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  It's an absolute pleasure to follow my very good friend the member for Kingston, who is of my vintage. We were students together in the 1990s. She and I knew each other then, and we were both very interested in higher education policy, so it's quite nice and fitting to follow her in the condolence debate in respect of the passing of the Hon. Susan Ryan AO, someone who made an indelible mark on my friend Amanda's life, on my life and on the lives of many people around Australia, particularly many women and older people around Australia. I want to offer my sincere condolences to Susan's friends, to her family and to all of her fellow Australians, who in fact are suffering the loss of this person, who was a great leader and a woman of great courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1977, which was coincidentally the year I was born, Susan Ryan became the first woman on our federal frontbench. When Labor returned to government in 1983, she became the first woman in a federal Labor cabinet, under Prime Minister Hawke. I want to just mention something that I think really demonstrates the courage that she showed. In 1978 she was one of only a handful of women in the Senate. It was a very different place back then, with very few women, and the politics of the time were very different as well. In that year, she moved a motion in the Senate to disallow a measure that stopped abortion clinics from being established in the Australian Capital Territory. This was an incredibly controversial thing to do. She stressed that she was doing it for democratic principles, not about the issue of abortion per se but supporting self-government for the territory. But nonetheless she copped a lot of abuse and threats in relation to moving that motion. For context, this was seven years before Queensland police raided an abortion clinic in what is now my electorate of Griffith, 24 years before abortion was decriminalised in the Australian Capital Territory and a full 40 years before abortion was decriminalised in my home state of Queensland. So that gives us an idea of what the politics must have been like at the time, and I suspect those of us who are in the parliament today, whether we agree with the motion or not, can only imagine the bravery that it would have taken to move that motion. She was someone who was incredibly brave, but she was also someone who had great foresight, great vision and really understood politics and the future of politics in this country. She was someone who saw the value of having women's electoral power harnessed through the Women's Electoral Lobby and through the Labor Party, of the value of having a women's electoral strategy, of campaigning on issues about how political decisions affected women. And she also saw, of course, the value of electing women to the federal parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there were many others, and we've spoken about many of them, but her work at this time was absolutely crucial. It laid the groundwork for the substantial number of women that we see in the Labor caucus today. It didn't happen by accident. It didn't happen by people just hoping and wishing that we would keep doing the same thing and somehow get a different outcome. It actually took courage and agency and the decision-making and the willingness to stand up and be brave, and she led that at the time, and many others joined her. But more than just the increase in the representation of women in the Labor caucus and, therefore, in the parliament, what she laid the groundwork for were the consequences of that increased representation. That is, governments and policy decisions and laws that better took into account and accommodated the impact on women and the issues that affected women. I'm not just talking about the sex discrimination legislation; I'm talking about more than thatâ€”making sure that those impacts on women are actually taken into account, and the issues that matter are also taken into account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as a woman in the parliament but also just as a woman in Australia, just as one of millions of women in Australia, I am so grateful to her for the work that she did during her time in the parliament and her time outside it. I'm also grateful for the words of advice and encouragement that she was generous enough to give me on the occasions that we met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to Susan's work as Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner as well as her work as Disability Discrimination Commissioner. Right now, with unemployment so high, people are feeling age discrimination and disability discrimination very keenly. In her role as commissioner, Susan wrote and published a landmark report in 2016 called <span style="font-style:italic;">Willing to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">work: national inquiry into employment discrimination against older</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australians and Australians with </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">isability</span>. In her report, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The right to work is a fundamental human right, but one that far too many older people and people with disability in Australia do not enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">â€¦Â Â Â â€¦Â Â Â â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Inquiry found that too many people are shut out of work because of underlying assumptions, stereotypes or myths associated with their age or their disability. These beliefs lead to discriminatory behaviours during recruitment, in the workplace and in decisions about training, promotion and retirement, voluntary and involuntary. The cost and impact of this is high, for individuals and for our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">People who are willing to work but are denied the opportunity are also denied the personal and social benefitsâ€”of dignity, independence, a sense of purpose and the social connectednessâ€”that work brings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to quote her words because this report was so incisive, so important and so incredibly salient right now in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. But let me leave the last words to my friend Everald Comptonâ€”known to many people in this placeâ€”who chaired the Advisory Panel on Positive Ageing which Susan was on. He's described her as a great patriot for women and the elderly, and he said: 'I will miss her greatly. So will Australia.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I rise to speak about a leader that we have lost, a leader who really did change this country, and not everyone who comes to this place and then leaves can say that they changed this country, but Susan Ryan, indeed, did. I often say I was lucky to grow up in Bob Hawke's Australia, but the reality is I was also lucky to grow up in Susan Ryan's Australia, the Australia that she built that was a much fairer place than it was before she entered this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equality and opportunity for Susan Ryan weren't just words. They were her mission on the day that she was elected to this place and every day that she served as a senator. Susan was born in the middle of World War II and studied for an arts degree at Sydney university. Like my mum, she started her working life as a teacher, but she became Labor's first ACT senator at a time when, finally, the Whitlam government, in 1974, legislated to create proper representation for the ACT. It's amazing that, to this day, we still debate how we make sure that the territories are properly represented in the parliament. She was a feminist, she was pro-women, she was pro-choice and she was republican.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been lucky to be here to listen to the speeches from the member for Newcastle, the member for Brand, the member for Macquarie, the member for Kingston and the member for Griffith. She genuinely inspired, encouraged and propelled a whole generation of future Labor leaders. She made Australia fairer for women. When you make Australia fairer for women, you also make it fairer for men. There were no longer any subsidies, effectively, for the employment of men, because we finally got to a point where things were truly equal. Indeed, the legislation that she put through the parliament fulfilled Bob Hawke's promise of bringing Australia together. We heard that she did work with the Women's Electoral Lobby, harnessing the power, the belief in collective organising, that you can actually change things and you don't have to accept things as they are. She served at different times as Minister for Education and Youth Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, Special Minister of State, which is an important portfolio for all of us who serve in this place, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentennial, in 1988. She served the country after she left this place as Age Discrimination Commissioner, Disability Discrimination Commissioner and, indeed, with the Whitlam Institute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What strikes me in reading through so much of her life history and where she found herself in the seventies, in this place, is that it was 1977 when she became the first woman on the Labor frontbench. The Labor Party had existed in this place for 77 years with no women on our frontbench. Indeed, we had women elected some 30 years earlier, with the great Western Australian, Dorothy Tangney, entering the Senate as the first woman in the Senate and first Labor woman in the Senate, but it would take another 30-plus years for any representation on the frontbench. We know that, without representation in that place, you don't truly have a voice at the table. I am someone who cares deeply about campaigning and making sure that Labor truly puts itself forward to all Australians, and I believe that Labor is the only party that can govern for all Australians. She was focused on the electoral challenge of the gender gap. Decade on decade, women had not supported the Labor Party to the same extent that men had. She formed a national women's policy committee with two aims: to ensure the improvement of Labor's policies for women, but also to make sure that we were communicating to women when they vote about why it is in their interests to vote Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her autobiography, Susan Ryan writes that she was alienated from conservative sectors of the community for being a feminist. Today doesn't quite reflect the alienation that she would have faced on a daily basis. Indeed, at times, there were robust conversations within her own party, but she continued to fight through. That's the really amazing thing: she was not discouraged and she was not slowed down; she saw that was further confirmation that she was on the right track. I want to pay tribute to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> obituary that they published in their editorial. It noted that this city of Canberra was part of what enabled her to flourish. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... like so many others, she discovered in Canberra a community in which she could flourish and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a really lovely thing to say about our nation's capital. Sometimes <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> might overdefend Canberra, but on this occasion <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> is 100 per cent right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note Eva Coxâ€”and I think sometimes politics can lack optimismâ€”in what she had to say. She notes that Susan Ryan was an 'optimist'. That is another thingâ€”that, when you're trying to do big reform, you have to be optimistic about the benefits that it will bring rather than just get stuck in the negativity of the current situation which you're in. Eva Cox says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Pessimism can be catching. I think too many on the left have caught it today. But unless you believe change is possible, there is no possibility for a better society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to pay tribute to the optimism of Susan Ryan as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to look at Susan Ryan's first speech. She calls out, very simply, in plain language that we probably don't use as much in this place today, 'the sexist organisation of our society'. When she's talking about the representation of women, she says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the sexist organisation of our society has many more important ramifications than the fact that there are not many women members in Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that those things are not important, but it is a reflection of a person who recognises that she was not in the parliament to better herself. She was in the parliament to better hundreds of thousands of women who needed a parliament to do its job for them, and that really struck me in reading her first speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finally note that, on that issue of representation, there is still a long way to go. In the House of Representatives, just 31.1 per cent of the membership are women, and often that's quoted as a good thing: 'Look how far we have come! Look at what we've done! We've achieved!' Thirty-one per cent is not an achievement; 31 per cent is a sign that we have a very, very long way to go in this place. I think it's also a reflection that we probably still have a long way to go in bringing true gender equality across Australia. Vale, Susan Ryan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  Susan Ryan was a giant of the ACT Labor movement as one of the founders of the Women's Electoral Lobby, a member of the original ACT Legislative Assembly and one of the first senators for the Australian Capital Territory. She served as a senior minister in Bob Hawke's Labor government, holding titles including Special Minister of State, Minister for Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. She was the first Labor woman to be appointed to a frontbench position, the first Labor woman appointed to a ministry and the first Labor woman to enter a cabinet. Many have recounted her pioneering political career and her era-defining contributions to the rights of women and the aged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a kid growing up in Canberra like me, if you had any interest in politics at all at that time, you knew of Susan Ryan, of her extraordinary drive to make a difference to our community and for equality of opportunity across Australia. Until 1983, it had been legal to discriminate on the basis of gender, marital status or pregnancy. Women were locked out of education, jobs and opportunity. My mother had to resign from the Public Service on the date of her marriage. Women were refused access to home finance and faced the sack for being pregnant. Because of Susan Ryan, my daughter will rightly have access to opportunities that were denied to my mother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Labor fundraiser I went to featured Susan as a guest speaker at the old Peking Restaurant in Philip. For any Canberrans in the room, that probably carbon dates me! But it was one of many to come and one of many to feature Susan Ryan as the guest speaker. She gave her time generously to support those who had followed in her footsteps. Although I was only very briefly a senator for the ACT, it was an immense privilege to know that I was following on that pathâ€”that I was following in the footsteps of the great first Labor senator for the ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Labor senator from an Irish Catholic background, it was also an immense privilege to follow in Susan Ryan's footsteps to speak at the annual St Patrick's Day ecumenical service at the Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture couple of years ago. As Jeff Kildea from the Aisling Society mentioned only a few days ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Susan represented the traditional trifecta of Irish, Catholic and Labor that figured prominently in the progressive side of Australian politics for much of the twentieth century. Growing up in the beachside suburb of Maroubra, she was educated at the local Brigidine convent school. According to a special edition of the Irish Echo of July 2019 celebrating 'The Top 100 Irish Australians', it was there that Susan was allowed to 'reconnect with her heritage that had been diluted since her great-grandparents emigrated to Australia'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Susan often spoke of the influence on her of the Brigidines, a teaching order of sisters founded in Ireland in 1807 and named for St Brigid, one of Ireland's patron saints. St Brigid was celebrated for her generosity to the poor and particularly poor women. With the abolition in 1880 of state aid for denominational education, Catholic bishops in New South Wales relied heavily on the Irish teaching orders to staff their schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well into the twentieth century these orders continued to instil in their students a sense of their Irishness. But that was not all they taught.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Susan Ryan has explained often:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'Students in these schools were exposed to the principles and practice of social justice, typically through an Irish lens. â€¦ Social justice values were a dominant element.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan casts an enormous shadow with her amazing, groundbreaking achievements in terms of equality for women across workplaces, across the whole of the Australian community, and across so many other areas of endeavour. One of her main achievements, which often goes under-reported, is that she was responsible as Minister for Education for getting year 12 completion rates up. In 1983, not so long ago, it used to be three in 10. By the end of the Hawke-Keating government, in 1996, we'd gotten up to nine in 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In later life Susan Ryan was still generous with her time. She fought for a better Public Service and better superannuation and against age discrimination. I can remember having a number of conversations with Susan in a different role, where she fought those issues around age discrimination. Only two years ago, at the last national Labor conference, at what I think was the better part of the conference, the fringe conference, I had a long conversation with Susan about discrimination in work for aged Australians. It was something that I'd come across as a union official: how many people in their late 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond still had so much to offer and yet were actively discriminated against. This is still an area where we need champions today, and I know that Senator Susan Ryan would be proud that today's Labor Party is still taking up these fights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor movement has lost a great person. I join all my Labor colleagues in wishing her family the best and offering our collective condolences and our wishes that we can do our best to follow in Susan Ryan's footsteps.</span>
              </p>

Obviously, there will be a final report to come, but it was important in the face of the COVID-19 crisis that the committee report on the very important questions relating to: the value of the program to Australia's economy, including tourism, health care and ag sectors; the ongoing impact of COVID-19 nationally and internationally on the program; the potential economic impacts on regional economies due to the disruption of access that working holiday-makers relied upon, especially for the ag and tourism sectors; the capacity, if any, for Australians made unemployed by COVID-19 to fill the labour shortage, among other issues; whether existing visa criteria and conditions related to working holiday-makers are still adequate and appropriate to address the purpose of this program; and the extent to which the program can support economic recovery in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor proved again that it was working constructively in getting this interim report on a very timely question out as soon as possible. I will not go into detail on the interim report, but I would like to note the recommendation that the government develop a 'Have a Gap Year at Home' campaign, appealing to young Australians' patriotism to undertake regional work after year 12. The report noted that it would provide young people with work experience opportunities at a time of stiff competition for a diminishing pool of jobs. Strengthening the patriotic sentiment of younger Australians to teach them resilience and discipline and develop social cohesion is a principle I absolutely support, and that should form part of our economic and social recovery from COVID-19 in some way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to note and support recommendation 4's subpoint, which suggests that working holiday-makers' visa conditions extend the northern Australia provision, allowing work in hospitality, tourism and other industries to apply in all regional, rural and remote areas. This is vitally important to NT growers. As I speak, hundreds of workers from Vanuatu are literally saving the mango harvest in the Northern Territory, which is valued at over $128 million. To give you an idea of how great the demand from agricultural producers in the NT was, the local mango industry footed the half-a-million-dollar bill to charter these workers to Darwin. To these workers, our Pacific friends and neighbours, I say thank you, or Tangkyu tumas, on behalf of all Territorians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an ability for more seasonal workers to come from Vanuatu. It would be good if the federal government provided some assistance by way of supporting the quarantine of more numbers of seasonal workers, because the estimate of the sector was that about 600 seasonal workers were required to pick the mangos this season. We have got a lot fewer than that. The pilot has been conducted. What should happen now is that all the pickers that we need are able to come, quarantine and get onto the farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it's not the first time this year that Australians have said thank you to our Pacific friends and family. Our Pacific neighbours were of course there when the bushfires gutted Australia's east coast last summer. Papua New Guinean troops were there, hundreds of them, with 900 others offered to deploy to fight those flames. Papua New Guineans were there for fire ravaged towns like Merimbula, where I have family, which received $60,000 in donations raised by some Papua New Guinean youths. Vanuatu was there for us with its support of $250,000 to families. I say this not in passing nor as an unrelated tangent but as a matter of national relevance and importance that we can and should never forget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Programs like the Seasonal Worker Program and the Pacific Labour Scheme are popular for a reason among all stakeholders. The Australian farmers in the first instance, like in the Northern Territory, need practical solutions to chronic skilled labour shortages, particularly in ag. The workers, who in this instance are Vanuatu workersâ€”currently some 170 are in the NTâ€”can make up to nine times the minimum wage in Vanuatu to pay for their children's school fees or education or, in other cases, build their own homes. Their families and communities benefit from the positive economic effects, which have been extensively demonstrated. And they strengthen the ties between Australia and Vanuatu, Timor-Leste and other Pacific island countries at the level of deep personal friendships and connections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are legitimate and very important concerns around protections for workers, be they backpackers or Pacific islanders. Some of the working conditions have been known to fall far short of Australian community standards. Labor will always stand up for workers. So protections for workers will never be waived away by this side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such programs could be scaled up in future, and there is certainly support and demand from Australians who benefit immensely from the vital support that these programs provide to their businesses. This was especially urgent in the face of the labour shortage triggered by COVID-19 and the hasty departure of over 50,000 backpackersâ€”imperilling the $14.4 billion horticulture sector. The interim report proposes ways to bring down barriers to make these programs more attractive for working holiday-makers, by enjoying more certainty and being able to move across state borders. These proposals are worthy of consideration, as are those for solving chronic labour shortages in the regions, especially in agricultural, by drawing on the talent, skills and patriotism of young Australians looking for an adventure. These are not mutually exclusive propositions but, rather, are elements of a more comprehensive and lasting national response, which we in this place owe to all Australians who draw immense benefit from these schemes and who look to us for leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a bit of a confession in rounding out my speech, and that is that I made a commitment to various members of this place that I would bring down some Northern Territory Kensington Pride mangos to this sitting of the House. Unfortunately, I got a bit busy before flying down here and wasn't able to do that. But, I will make sure that I do so for the October sittings. I will be going around to the office of the chair of the House of Representatives agricultural committee to offer him some. I enjoy working with him on his agricultural committee. We are doing important work at the moment around forestry plantations. He knows, as I do, coming from somewhere outside of Sydneyâ€”and no offence to the honourable member here from that fine cityâ€”that sometimes the challenges of working, living and running businesses in regional areas of Australia are not fully appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that this week when we had the unfortunate situation where the government has been tussling with itself about whether to ensure fair representation for Northern Territorians. Like other regional parts of our country, the people of the Northern Territory have needs and challenges, and they deserve to be respected in this place. They deserve to have fair representation. So I look forward to the Senate vote tomorrow on fair representation for the Northern Territory. I also look forward to that bill, having passed the Senate, that other place, coming across to the House of Representatives where it can be passed. The passing of that bill will guarantee fair representation in this place for Territorians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all those members who are joining with the people of the Northern Territoryâ€”those who don't consider Territorians to be second-class citizens but consider them to be full members of the Australian Commonwealth. We look forward to that bill passing the House of Representatives tomorrow, guaranteeing fair representation for Territorians. The challenges and the opportunities in regional Australia are immense. So we don't want a situation where what happens in this place is only representative of people who live in major capital cities on the east coast; we want a situation where what happens here is representative of the whole Australian Commonwealth. By doing that, we will make our nation a stronger, more productive nationâ€”and that's in the interests of everyone who's represented in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  Before I commence with my contribution, I'd like to thank my colleagues for their wonderful contributions to the condolence motion for Susan Ryan.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has hit many industries hard, as people have stayed home and away from shops, venues, airports and more. But, while we sit in lockdown and think of the places we can't go, it's easy to forget that we are largely cut off from the world and that people can't come here. While holiday-makers wouldn't be able to patronise those shops, venues and airports either, there is a group of people who we need to come hereâ€”namely, working holiday-makers. Our farmers depend on working holiday-makers to pick their crops, and, in turn, we rely on them to keep the fresh produce in our supermarkets and one of our larger trade exports running. We need to look at this problem with flexibility and practicality but also urgency. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration has been looking at this issue for a few months now, working feverishly to gather evidence and to examine potential solutions. I believe we will bring forward our full report in the coming months, but this late stage of the season has forced us to bring forward this interim report to specifically address the problems that farmers are facing now. I would like to thank the chair, the member for Berowra, and the co-chair, the member for Calwell, for conducting this inquiry so well and having the flexibility to allow us to deliver the solutions that people in the bush need now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has settled on 10 recommendations. Many of these recommendations relate to short-term payments, incentives and adaptations to existing arrangements like JobKeeper. These are excellent recommendations, and I recommend them to the government. The recommendations I'm most proud of are the ones that hope to change the culture around working on farms and young people's attitude to travel. Recommendation 1 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ The Committee recommends that the Government urgently develop and implement a 'Have a Gap Year at Home Campaign' to attract young Australians, particularly the current cohort of Year 12s and university graduates, to undertake regional work. The campaign should:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Provide young people with work and work experience opportunities at a time when there are fewer casual jobs available to young people; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great cultural institution of travelling overseas for a gap year borne out of an outdated mentality that we are in a far corner of the world and that culture and wonderment is something that can only be found on foreign shores. But those notions that Australia is the land that culture forgot are old-fashioned and obsolete. Our grey nomads have discovered the wonders of the Australian bush, and we need to encourage young Australians to explore our own backyard. Doing some work while exploring it is an integral part of any gap-year experience, giving new insights into life on the land and a full appreciation of how this country works. Aside from the romantic element of getting out onto farms while seeing Australia, there is a practical element to this too. Just as holiday-makers can't come here, there are thousands of young Australians whose gap-year plans for 2021 are in tatters, as the world keeps its borders shut tight. Why not encourage the people who can't leave here to pick up for the people who can't get here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar theory has informed recommendations 2 and 3, which look to help regional unemployed people into work on farms. From eight-year lows last year, regional unemployment has now soared, as has unemployment across Australia. While obviously not everybody will be capable of doing the work, there must be large numbers of people who would be able and willing to work on farms at this time. It could even be the leg-up into longer-term employment that could get people off government support sooner and more permanently. If the jobs are there and the workers are there, we must look at ways of connecting the two. This can be done through helping the bureaucracy assist people to find those jobs, which is addressed in recommendation 9, or creating the carrots and sticks to encourage people to take up that work. We've looked closely at making that carrot sweeter through allowing continued access to JobSeeker while working on a farm or providing a payment to cover travel and accommodation costs. With some long-term unemployed, we may also have to look at making the stick tougher but always understanding that there are some people who are just not cut out for work on the land. It has been excellent to see the speed with which the government has been working on these recommendations since this interim report was tabled only weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the budget reported $17.4 million over two years to assist individuals to relocate to regional areas for employment opportunities, including for short-term agricultural work of up to at least six weeks duration. Modifications will include temporarily removing the waiting period to provide all jobseekers in employment services access to assistance to relocate to take up full-time, ongoing employment. This is the sort of speed and flexibility that our government will be remembered for and is why Australians are faring so well in this pandemic when the countries we normally compare ourselves with are faltering.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  Overall, I commend the report. It's not 100 per cent perhaps what any of us would have written, but I think it's a good example of bipartisanship. We worked through it together, and it was broadly agreed across the committee and has a series of, if implemented, sensible recommendations. It is perhaps a peculiar report if you pick it up thinking you're going to read about the Working Holiday Maker program, which of course is a pre-eminent cultural exchange program for the nation, because predominantly the report talks about regional labour shortages. So the colloquially named 'backpacker visas' and the recommendations go all to pretty much how we could plug the agricultural and regional labour shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not widely understood, I think, in the Australian communityâ€”certainly amongst many people in the cityâ€”just how dependent a lot of agriculture in regional Australia, and other industries indeed, have become on temporary migrant labour. This visa is one of many important visas. About 84 per cent of working holiday-makers now in Australia actually work. They don't have to. I know a lot of Australian kids go overseas on similar equivalent visas, because these are reciprocal exchanges in many cases, and don't work. They go for holidays and backpacking and tourism. But 84 per cent of people in Australia on working holiday-maker visas work in some form. Indeed, since I think 2005 and 2016, when changes were made in both years, there are now significant incentives for people on working holiday-maker visas to stay for longer and go and do regional work for a period of time. So these industries have become increasingly reliant on working holiday-makers and temporary migrants to do this kind of labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry heard significant and very serious evidence about the growing labour shortage in these industries, and it's not something we can ignore. Between March and June this year, the number of working holiday-makers in Australia fell from 140,000 to 70,000. In just three months, we saw 70,000 backpackersâ€”colloquially calledâ€”leave the country without the corresponding flow coming in. The National Farmers Federation said, 'Industry will be confronted with a labour crisis, the likes of which it has never seen before.' The regional labour shortage is serious, growing and urgent. Hence, the interim report quite reasonably focuses on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no single solution. I think of it like a jigsaw puzzle, and it's not our job as a committee, as other speakers have said, to put together some kind of answer. Migration is not the sole answer. It's not our job in the migration committee to give the government a plan or a proposal to deal with this crisis. But there are some pieces of the jigsaw which I think we can offer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just put on the record: there are many reasons why it is hard to get Australians to do this work. It's hard work. It's physically hard work. It's often isolated from the population centres. It's low pay. It's not great pay given the sort of manual labour involved and the hours involved. And the sector, unfortunately, as we've seen over many years, is rife with exploitation. Now, I say that trying to be balanced. There are many employers trying to do the right thing. There are many farmers trying to do the right thing. But everyone knows that this sectorâ€”agricultural labour in particular, and some of the dodgy labour hire companies that proliferate finding workers for this sectorâ€”exploit people, and it's got that reputation. But also, of course, it's seasonal. There are peaks and troughs, so it's always going to be inherently difficult to get solely Australian workers to come and go at the right time. So there's a natural fit with temporary migrants, who do come and go from the country and often look for short-term work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the solutions, as has been touched on by previous speakers, fall into a few different categories. There are solutions which you might call domestic. In that regard, the gap year, the idea of saying to students finishing year 12 or students finishing university, who might have been looking at doing a gap year overseas, or entering employment in the case of people finishing TAFE or uni, who are looking at the employment market or looking at their inability to travelâ€”it makes perfect sense that we'd say to those young people, 'Hey, have you thought about having a gap year in Australia, or at least a gap six months? Take some time, see another bit of the country and help out with what is a serious national labour shortage, and you get paid to do it.' That is a good option. It's not going to see tens of thousands of young Australians, I believe, flooding to do this work, but with the right promotion and the right effort from the government and the right incentives, it may fill part of the gap and be part of the solution. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that regard, I see that the government has announced some incentives around HECS and Newstart and so on. Their previous efforts regarding incentivising people on Newstart have failed. They've failed because they simply didn't recognise the economic reality that an extra two or three grand is simply impossible for someone trying to survive on Newstart to pay their rent in the cityâ€”often they're in the cityâ€”to keep paying their bills in the city and nick off to the country for two or three months and try and pay for accommodation there. It just doesn't add up. So the recommendations we made as a committee were more open ended, trying to recognise that the government's previous efforts have just failed. They weren't well designed. The government has responded, and time will tell whether those domestic incentives actually work or not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's then a series of recommendations, which the member for Solomon and others have touched on, around incentivising working holiday-makers who are here to stay longer and continue working. That's a good thing. They're already in the country. We don't have the quarantining border issues, predominantly. There's a bit of stuff about moving between states, but if we can incentivise them to stay and do more work in the sectors where we need them, that's a good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's a series of very interesting recommendations which effectively look at what you might call other temporary migrants. We had a range of evidence from various sector or industry stakeholders, as well as the Migration Institute of Australia, who quite reasonably pointed out that there's a range of temporary migrants already in the country who we could be drawing on. Of course I should also have acknowledged the role that the Seasonal Worker Program and our Pacific Island friends have played, which the member for Solomon touched on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a couple of remarks about these other temporary migrants. I think the recommendations are quite thoughtfully crafted. We've suggested, for example, that we could look at incentivising international students who graduate, many of whom want to stay in Australia on the 485 visa, not all but some of whom are pursuing or seeking a pathway to permanent residency. Frankly, they're scared at the moment, when they look at the graduate employment market, thinking, 'I'm chasing my dream of contributing to this country; I've paid a fortune for my education, a high-quality education; and I don't see the possibility of getting the professional employment that I need in the next year or so in a graduate field. What am I going to do?' This would be a great option, at least to provide them with an option where they could do some regional work, then hopefully come back on that 485 visa for a longer period and still pursue the pathway they were seeking. That's quite sensible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was what I would call a nutty suggestion from labour hire firms saying that we should let all international students go bush now and they can just study online. I'm glad we didn't recommend that. I think that would open up the most enormous rort you can imagine, if we said to all international students, 'Go off and try and do your studies from a shearing shed while you're picking fruit.' It might be convenient from a labour point of view, but it fundamentally undermines the international education sector and what we should be on about in this country. If you come to this country to studyâ€”the pandemic asideâ€”you should be studying as much as possible in classrooms. Otherwise, why are you here? We're just selling a work visa, and that's not something we should tolerate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, there were also some suggestions around other temporary visas. There was a sensible suggestion around the temporary skilled visa. Generally, if you're on a temporary skilled visa you're restricted to work for the same employer, but the suggestion is that we could relax the conditions to allow people who've lost their jobs because of the Morrison recession, the pandemic, whatever you want to call it, allow them to work for another employer. That makes sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of things that we haven't got in here at the moment. We should have a bit more about the exploitation and the Fair Work Ombudsman, but perhaps we can address that in the final report. There's one thing in here which was touched on in the evidence but which is not in the recommendations, but I do think there's an opportunity. That is to help farmers by incentivising a certain cohort of refugees to do this work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have in this country 3Â½ thousand people, who arrived and were found to be genuine refugees, who are existing on SHEV visas, the safe haven enterprise visa. They were sold a pup, basically, in 2014 by the now Prime Minister. They were told: 'If you go to regional areas on this SHEV visa, then you will have a pathway to permanency.' Well, 3Â½ thousand of them did that, and not one of themâ€”in six years, not one of themâ€”has got a permanent visa. We've also got 14,000 people who arrived by boatâ€”over 10 years ago in some cases, but certainly over seven or eight years agoâ€”who are on temporary protection visas. These are people who've been found to be genuine refugees who exist as a permanent underclass in this country. I have thousands of these people in my electorate. After the suggestion that the Refugee Council of Australia made, when it said: 'What if we let some of these people go and do this work in return for a permanent visa?', I've been contacted by numerous people saying: 'Where do I sign? I will go tomorrow. I simply want to be able to secure my future in this country. I've been here for 10 yearsâ€”at what point will the government let me be Australian?' And I think that's a sub-optimal position. These people have been here for 10 years: I believe they should just get a permanent visa. But it's not a bad suggestionâ€”it's a pragmatic suggestionâ€”that would help at least some of them. In that regard, I hope that in the final report, whenever it's released, we see some progress and some recommendations on this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the member for Bennelong and the member for Nicholls, a Liberal Party member and National Party member, for publiclyâ€”in the committee hearing and out in the mediaâ€”saying this is something we should look at, or, indeed, calling for it. And I know privately, from conversations with other National Party members of parliament, that there's also growing support for this. I hope that we can find a bipartisan solution to this problem.</span>
