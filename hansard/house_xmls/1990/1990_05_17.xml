       International Earth Repair Action Decade

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that:
      </para>
      <para>
       our total global environment is rapidly deteriorating;
      </para>
      <para>
       important natural resources vital to human life and livelihood such as ozone, trees, soil and water are being depleted at an increasing and alarming rate;
      </para>
      <para>
       there is an urgent need to educate all people in conservation skills and the responsible use and maintenance of natural resources;
      </para>
      <para>
       the United Nations Association of Australia (UNAA) has proclaimed an Australian Earth Repair Action (ERA) Decade from 1988;
      </para>
      <para>
       Earth Repair Action will unite people, communities, religions and nations in the productive purpose of greening and repairing our Earth for a safer and more peaceful future.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will:
      </para>
      <para>
       Propose that an International Earth Repair Action (ERA) Decade begin on World Environment Day, June 5, 1990 with FIERY, the First International Earth Repair Year, and that this be proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly. This ten-year plan will ignite the spirit of local and global co-operation to hygienically compost all presently wasted bio-degradable materials into humus to revitalise soils; grow billions of trees to replace forests lost and replenish the atmosphere; establish sustainable, economic and agricultural growth internationally and end world hunger.

       Capital Gains Tax
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the proposal of the Opposition Parties to remove the tax on capital gains which has operated in Australia since September 1985, and points out to the House that such a proposal would:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. mean a windfall gain of billions of dollars to Australia's richest people
      </para>
      <para>
       2. disadvantage the 99.2 per cent of Australians who pay no capital gains tax
      </para>
      <para>
       3. be in complete disregard of the desires of the people of Australia that capital gains be subject to tax
      </para>
      <para>
       4. restore the tax avoidance industry to the prominence it enjoyed under the former Liberal/National Party government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the House maintain its support for the Government's capital gains tax.

       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas on 11th March 1990, the democratically elected and legal Government of Lithuania re-declared its independence from the Soviet Union into which it had been forcibly incorporated in 1940.
      </para>
      <para>
       And whereas the Soviet Union is refusing to recognise this rightful independence and is applying threats and intimidation to pressurise the people and government of Lithuania into rescinding their declaration.
      </para>
      <para>
       And whereas the Australian Government, whilst not recognising annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, has not taken up this opportunity to demonstrate support for the justified aspirations of the Lithuanian people for freedom.
      </para>
      <para>
       So therefore do the undersigned sincerely and urgently petition the Senate to pursue immediate steps for the issuing of formal recognition of Lithuania's Declaration of Independence and to publicly endorse the right of the Lithuanian people to self-determination.

       Therapeutic Goods Regulations

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt homeopaths and herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a public enquiry into the questions of registration of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods.

Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies.

The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt homeopaths and herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries.

       1. Last year the Federal Government made superannuation funds liable to pay tax on capital gains at the rate of 15 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. This means that when people retire they will receive a smaller superannuation payout than they would if tax on capital gains did not apply.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. It is unfair that people who save for their own retirement-instead of going on the pension-should be taxed in this way.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, therefore, your petitioners request the House to ask the incoming Government to act immediately to repeal the law which makes superannuation funds pay tax on capital gains.

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. We the undersigned students of the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, residents of the State of New South Wales, draw to the attention of the House several grievances concerning lack of facilities and resources on the campuses of the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       The libraries are grossly inadequate according to the minimum standards set for single campus Colleges of Advanced Education by ACAE. As we are a multi-campus University, with the resulting need for research materials and duplication, this inadequacy is even more dramatic.

      <para>
       The time frame for the construction of the infrastructure joining the Werrington and Kingswood precincts of the Kingswood campus, the buildings on Westmead North campus and the new library at Kingswood is such that at least two generations of students will pass through before there is any feeling of belonging to a University. Students are currently studying on building sites.

       1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian national flag.

       (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.

       3. They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.
      </para>

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that we, the undersigned citizens of Australia, here register our firm protest against the current form of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which seeks to restrict as S2 and S4 poisons those traditional natural medicines which have been used safely for centuries. The effect of these regulations will be to:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Restrict approximately forty or more major healing herbs and their homoeopathic derivatives as scheduled poisons, (eg: Comfrey) to be dispensed only by general practitioners, veterinary surgeons, dentists and pharmacists.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Prohibit manufacturers of traditional natural medicines from communicating any information regarding the use of their preparations to those specialised in their use-even in private or during an educational seminar limited to practitioners. This right to knowledge will now be exclusive to doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and pharmacists.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Increase the cost of all natural therapeutic substances by imposing exorbitant registration, licensing and inspection fees.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Require wholesalers and manufacturers of herbal materials to meet the same standards regarding equipment and premises as large scale pharmaceutical manufacturers.
      </para>
      <para>
       If these regulations are allowed to be proclaimed, it will severely hamper natural therapy practice and deny the right of citizens of this country to choose the therapy they wish.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the House:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Set aside the passing of this legislation until thorough public investigation of the ramifications of the Act upon the natural therapies professions is carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Carry out an impartial assessment of the effect of this legislation upon the rights of the individual to select the mode of wholistic health care of ones choice, which is presently affordable and accessible to all.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Immediately begin procedures leading to the registration of practitioners of natural therapies now under threat of prohibition by this Act.

The effect of the regulations will be to:
      </para>

       1. Prohibit the sale of homoeopathic remedies, in any potency, made from substance listed on the poisons schedule including the right of qualified homoeopaths to dispense such remedies to their patients.

       (6) notes that the report further recommends that the three categories of common interest should be allowed in relation to international as well as national private telecommunications networks;

       (7) notes that the Prime Minister in his recent letter to the Minister for Transport and Communications said that this matter was ``particularly vital'';

       (8) agrees with and endorses Austel's recommendations;

      <para>
       (10) calls on the Minister for Transport and Communications to give the new Ministerial direction under section 73 (2) of the Telecommunications Act to enable the early implementation of Austel's recommendations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The effect of this motion is to seek to implement the report of the Australian Telecommunications Authority-Austel-entitled Private Networks: Common Interest. At the outset I want to say that this motion is put in a bipartisan way and to suggest that the whole House should be able to adopt the motion without controversy. The motion gives us all an opportunity to say that the Government should now implement Austel's clear and straightforward recommendations which will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of telecommunications services to the Australian community.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Austel report constitutes the first comprehensive evaluation of the role of private networks in the Australian telecommunications sector. It also sets out a blueprint for change which will bring the benefits of private networks to small and medium-sized firms. In its report, Austel has done us a service. It has cut through the rhetoric of those who obstruct reform by arguing age-old red herrings about the threat to the funding of Telecom Australia's community service obligations, as they are called, and capital investment program that is said to be constituted by by-passing the Telecom network.
      </para>
      <para>
       Instead, what Austel has in fact done is to chart a course which we believe balances the economic benefits of private networks with what it says is the legitimate goal of avoiding wholesale by-passing of the basic telecommunications network. Austel has also done us a service by highlighting the importance of private telecommunications networks and their potential. It said in its report:
      </para>
      <para>
       Private networks are valuable in allowing users to develop innovative telecommunications applications geared to their specific requirements and which contribute to efficiency and productivity in the economy as a whole.
      </para>
      <para>
       There could not be a more enthusiastic endorsement of the cause of private telecommunications networks than that which I have just read out, it being the view of the Government's independent telecommunications advisory authority.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is important, as with all things, that we have very clearly in our minds precisely what is being proposed here. Under the present rules a private network service is a telecommunications service utilising leased lines used for the carriage of private traffic via the person supplying the service or by persons all of whom have a common interest with each other.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Austel report extends this to recommend three categories of common interest as the criteria for an approved private telecommunications network. One of those categories is new, and it is this new category that forms the basis for the potential expansion of private telecommunications networks. The three categories are: first of all, a need to communicate category, broadly embracing the current basis for ordinary use of private networks; secondly, a capacity sharing category-this is the new initiative which establishes a category that is not permitted under the current arrangements; and, thirdly, a government agencies category. In other words, if any of these three cases can be made out then the persons concerned can, in effect, set up a private telecommunications network.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second category is the important new initiative which we want to highlight here. It means that two or more unrelated persons or companies will be able to come together and literally share a private telecommunications network between them. This, of course, as honourable members will appreciate, is really quite momentous. If the parties concerned are prepared to share the private network and, of course, share the cost of it and make sure that the leasing charges are paid for, they will be able to have their own private network. This will be a great boost to private telecommunications networks, which is the way this country should go.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Austel proposal, by requiring that the expansion of the capacity sharing arrangements is limited by a joint and several liability condition-that is, a condition that all of the users will be liable to pay the bill-ensures that bypass of the basic network will be controlled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report has been welcomed by the private sector and by virtually everyone interested in telecommunications. It provides an opportunity for the Government and, indeed, for the whole Parliament to show that we really are serious about micro-economic reform in the telecommunications sector. I raise this here today to make it quite plain that we, in the Opposition, really are serious about micro-economic reform in the telecommunications sector as, of course, in other sectors. This is a case where the Opposition and the Government should be able to speak with one voice.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, we call on the Minister for Transport and Communications in the terms of the motion to give the new ministerial direction pursuant to section 73 (2) of the Telecommunications Act 1975 to allow Austel to make the necessary changes to the class licence and its guide to implement the recommendations. No legislation is needed. All that is needed to implement this momentous reform in telecommunications is a prompt decision and a new ministerial direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       For too long the benefits of private network to business and, indeed, to the community as a whole have been denied because of a concern that liberalisation of telecommunications would undermine both Telecom's ability to fund its community service obligations, as they are called, and its ability to develop its network infrastructure. In order to remove any possible basis for delay in the implementation of the Austel recommendations we should put the record straight on these two issues. In the first case, there are the community service obligations. Of course, Telecom has long maintained that there is a very large cost involved in this. It has maintained that it is $600m per annum.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, in a landmark report-it is the only way to describe it-has found that the true value of the community service obligations is somewhere between $120m and $270m per annum. The amount involved is much less than was previously thought. Furthermore, it is often forgotten that there are alternatives to internal cross-subsidisation, for example, direct budget allocations for socially desirable services. There are also explicit surcharges that can be made on some telecommunications service users. The community service obligation argument against expanding private network development is simply a much weaker argument than it used to be. It clearly cannot be used as a reason for delaying the implementation of the reform that is under discussion today. In fact, Austel said exactly this itself. In its report it said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . capacity sharing of narrowband private network services under the conditions proposed in AUSTEL's recommendations would be unlikely to lead to substantial diversion of public network traffic or to have a significant impact upon Telecom's revenue base or contribution margins.
      </para>
      <para>
       Austel has put to rest that argument itself in plain terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second objection that may be raised is with respect to Telecom's own capital investment program. The fall-back position-that is really what it is-is that there is Telecom's vulnerable, as it is often put, capital investment program. This argument is based on the contention that reduction through bypass or by using private networks in Telecom's traditional revenue streams would result, and that it would seriously undermine Telecom's capacity to implement modern network architecture and systems. Some argue that Telecom already engages in what is known as gold plating. Others have argued that it has been slow to innovate technological advances. The argument is increasingly being put that Telecom needs a spur of increased private network activity to ensure that its network development is up to the mark.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is appropriate here that we should also acknowledge, not only as Austel has said itself, that the community service obligation argument is not a reason for delayed implementation of its report, but also neither is the second ground a justification for not implementing Austel's recommendations at an early stage. There is, of course, the other issue of resale. That was not touched on except to explain in Austel's report why it was not dealt with. The reason why it is not the subject of an express recommendation so far as changing the resale rules is concerned is that it was not covered by Austel's terms of reference. However, in any event the Austel report does not deal with resale for that very reason. So it cannot conceivably be used as an argument by anyone as a reason for opposing today's motion.
      </para>
      <para>
       To put it in a nutshell, we note that the former Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, when this report was released, said that she was confident that the final report would be well received by an incoming government. Of course, if there were a coalition government in power today it would certainly be well received and would be implemented forthwith. We say in a bipartisan spirit that the present Government should implement Austel's report on private networks. As I have said, and as Austel has said itself, it will be a great boost to the very desirable results that would come about from an expanded use of private telecommunications networks.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no justification whatsoever for any further delay in the implementation of these recommendations. Any of the reasons advanced for delay would fall to the ground. In particular, there is no point in the Government saying, `Well, we have a review under way of all of the telecommunications carriers, let's leave it at that'. Everyone knows that but it is not a justification for taking this momentous step towards the further liberalisation of private telecommunications networks. For those reasons we urge the House to adopt the motion that I have moved.

        â€”The subject of the motion moved by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) is an important one. I welcome the debate about this subject now because it is timely. However, I find it difficult to support the motion because the Austel report about which he is talking is astonishingly sloppy and is really very disappointing.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I had imagined that the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, when it was established would have tried very hard to be rigorous, but it turns out to be most ideologically askewed. What the report does is make competition an end in itself rather than a means to an end.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is an amazing sentence in here-the economic framework is being discussed-and the report writers say:
      </para>
      <para>
       There will almost inevitably be a trade-off to be considered between competition and efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       The whole point of competition is to increase efficiency. Competition is not an end in itself, yet this report in a sense sanctifies competition. It makes competition into some kind of religion whereas in fact it ought to be a means of providing a lower cost and more efficient service to consumers. Yet the report itself has conclusions that are inconsistent with the evidence it provides. For example, it talks about setting up an oligopoly-that is, in this case, three networks-but it recognises that the danger of having three networks is that there will be duplication of investment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report accepts that if three networks are established there is likely to be overinvestment by about 30 to 50 per cent. That means that there would be 30 to 50 per cent more investment than was necessary to meet the demand for cellular mobile telephones. The effect of that must be to increase the costs to the consumers: someone has to cover the cost of excess capacity. That will mean that the prices consumers have to pay are substantially higher than they would be if there were only one carrier. Is the goal of increasing competition worth that increased price? I very much doubt that consumers would believe so. What consumers want is lower priced cellular telephones, both in terms of the purchase price of the set and the cost of the calls. They do not want to be paying for an ideological framework that someone happens to believe is more appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report also concedes that an oligopoly like this with three enterprises may well not lead to price competition. The evidence from oligopolies in other industries and from overseas is that they tend not to lead to price competition. It is quite true that one of the three enterprises could be price competitive, could reduce its prices so as to attract more business, but the evidence suggests that oligopolists tend not to do that. They tend to compete through advertising, through the way they present their service, or by offering lower priced sets and higher priced calls so that one pays less at the beginning and more later. In terms of the total cost the consumer has to pay, the evidence suggests that the price competition, which of course one would like to see, may well not occur if there are three firms involved. There are, as the report notes, dangers of strategic errors, dangers of waste and of higher prices, and there is also a danger from loss of spectrum efficiency of about 25 per cent in having three networks rather than one.
      </para>
      <para>
       But those are not the only points that can be made about this report. The report does not even mention that the public will lose the benefit of the higher profits that Telecom Australia would make if it had a monopoly in this area. Those profits do not go to a private monopolist; they are not lost to the public; they can then be used by Telecom for additional investment in the cellular telephone area or for cross-subsidisation in other areas. If we allow entry to two private operators they would cream off the highest profits from the most profitable routes. In this situation Telecom's scope for cross-subsidisation would be substantially reduced. The danger is that they would both come in and operate the route between Sydney and Melbourne, which will certainly be an extraordinarily profitable route, but not offer services at all to other cites, let alone regional areas. So the effect might be to reduce the availability of this service to other parts of the country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report also neglects the empirical evidence that is available from overseas-or at least it presents it, fortunately, in appendices, but does not seem to take adequate account of it in the conclusions reached. The most important empirical evidence is that the present Telecom mobile net service is quite satisfactory. No-one disputes that it is operating effectively. If it is operating effectively and to the satisfaction of consumers, there is not an obvious case for changing the situation. The Austel report states, `Mobile Net has performed well to date'. That is a pretty clear affirmation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the present service. Beyond that, the total cost of cellular mobile telephones in Australia is in fact below the current average of other countries. That must be one of the main criteria for consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report concludes that, given the international evidence, competition is not likely to result in either lower overall prices or lower handset prices in Australia. If one looks at countries such as Britain or those in Scandinavia where cellular telephone networks are in place, the lowest prices are in fact in Scandinavia where there are monopolies, whereas in countries such as Britain, where there is some competition, the prices are higher. So the overseas evidence suggests that the competition being proposed here is not likely to be effective.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report leads one to the conclusion that competition is not likely to reduce costs; therefore that it is not likely to reduce prices and not likely to improve the total level of service. Those are the two criteria that consumers must have in mind. Therefore, the Government should look very carefully at this report, and I am inclined to think, on the basis of the evidence available, that it should not accept it.

         â€”I find myself in an unusual position today in seeking the indulgence of the House to make a speech in accordance with the conventions attached to a maiden speech having, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, previously made a number of other speeches in the House associated with my ministerial responsibilities. In doing so, I trust that neither history nor the people of Hotham will confuse, as Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio did last week, my first speech in the House with my maiden speech.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would not like anyone to think that my views and visions-the matters that are traditionally canvassed in a maiden speech-were solely concerned with the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill, the subject of my first speech in the House-as important a piece of legislation as it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am honoured and privileged to have been placed by my parliamentary colleagues in the Australian Labor Party in this unique position. I express my appreciation to them and my commitment to work conscientiously towards the achievement of our shared objectives. I also express my sincere appreciation to the people of Hotham for their support and trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        In periods of fundamental change and transition there inevitably exists the potential for concerns and uncertainty. I am, however, firmly convinced that the policies of this Government, outlined in the Governor-General's Speech, are the correct policies for the future of this country in meeting the challenge of change.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding the difficulty being experienced by sections of the community, the Australian people recognised on 24 March that there is no serious alternative to this Government's proven record and future agenda. There was a swing against Labor in Victoria, but in the electorate of Hotham my Liberal opponent's vote also fell, despite the benefit of the donkey vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the final analysis there was no doubt concerning the people of Hotham's considered assessment of their own circumstances and the national interest in their clear endorsement of the Hawke Government. Nothing the Opposition has said in this place over the past fortnight would persuade any fair-minded person to reverse that assessment. The Opposition's message has been fundamentally negative.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now wish to pay tribute to my immediate predecessors. As honourable members may be aware, the boundaries of Hotham now embrace parts of the old seat of Henty. The past member for Henty, Joan Child, is well known in this place for her distinguished career as a member and Speaker of the House. I associate myself fully with the many tributes paid to her on her retirement from the House. I also pay tribute to the past member for Hotham, Lewis Kent, a man whose commitment and dedication cannot be called into question. It is my intention to build on the achievements of both those former members at the community level in the newly consolidated seat of Hotham. To the people of Hotham I say simply and unequivocally that I will serve and represent my electorate with integrity and to the best of my abilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I come to this House after 20 years of active involvement in the trade union movement, of which I have been reminded of over the past fortnight. It is a period of my life which gave me a great opportunity and for which I feel immensely grateful. The Australian trade union movement is now recognised internationally as the leading trade union movement in the world, largely because it has confronted the inevitability of change and actively involved itself in the process of change. This has included the need for considerable sacrifices in the national interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        A strong pro-active and independent trade union movement is a bellwether of a strong democracy. In these dramatic and historic times, as we observe with humility and intense admiration the efforts of the men and women of the countries of eastern Europe to seize their destinies and overturn totalitarianism in favour of democracy, it is no mere detail or unintended consequence that those people are establishing free trade unions as an initial step.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week the new honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in his maiden speech declared himself for the individual. The context of this ringing declaration was the asserted contest between modern trade unionism and the individual. However, the trade union movement is nothing at all if not concerned with the promotion and protection of individual rights and freedoms. This is the very bedrock principle of trade unionism. It is the essence of naivety to ignore the fact that in a democracy it is through collective means that such rights and freedoms are protected. Without the capacity for collective action in its democratic forms, whether through trade union organisation or indeed the Parliament, then individual rights are at risk and the aspirations of individuals will remain unfulfilled.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia the trade union movement has a proud history and record of achievement. It has been a history of struggle and at times enormous sacrifice in the pursuit of economic and social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last seven years have seen the effective forging of a structural relationship between the labour movement's political and industrial wings, a relationship beyond mere historical ties and born out of common objectives, one able to be judged in concrete terms; a relationship which has seen the trade union movement put the national interest ahead of narrow self-interest, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) so honestly acknowledged last week. I think it is an important concession on his part.
       </para>
       <para>
        The accord has enabled this country to create a completely new and practical dimension to industrial relations, wages and labour market policies, a dimension which goes beyond distribution and beyond disputation. The accord develops a new tool of economic management, one able to be applied to the task of wealth creation in a socially responsible and compassionate way. It enables a balance in the adjustment processes between competing goals of efficiency and equity. It also enables a balance between macro-economic and micro-economic concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        The accord is a comprehensive, radical and now proven approach, one that has still got a long way to go but which has been of enormous advantage to date in terms of this country's national interest. Above all, it is an approach, Mr Deputy Speaker, with which we must persist. The approach embodied in the accord stands in stark contrast to deregulation of the labour market: a system with no macro-economic direction, no equity or social objectives and no framework for tapping cooperation at all levels in the economy; a system based on market forces determining wage outcomes and invoking penalties against those who take industrial action. In the current economic environment it would inevitably lead to a wages breakout, to social disorder and to uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        In abandoning effective centralised wage fixation which the accord has delivered, the wages breakout would inevitably lead to rampant inflation and falling investment inducing recession and its consequences of unemployment and a wages freeze, just as occurred in 1981-82 under the coalition Government. We would again wallow in a mire of industrial disputation and litigation and, as I made the point at the last Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress, only a fool would contemplate it, yet we have an Opposition whose policies would once again achieve it. It has learned nothing from the past, nor does it understand the potential of the accord.
       </para>
       <para>
        One simple proposition underpins the approach embodied in the accord; that is, genuine involvement leads to responsibility. The trade union movement and the Hawke Labor Government have realised this and developed it accordingly. It is salutary to reflect that those countries that have been prepared to accept the legitimacy of the role of the trade union movement and to work with it have shown themselves better able to make the necessary adjustments in these difficult economic times.
       </para>
       <para>
        The challenge that now confronts us, Mr Deputy Speaker, is for unions and management to develop a similar constructive relationship at the enterprise and industry level, a relationship built around genuine involvement. The new wages system and award restructuring is the vehicle for building that relationship. Properly developed it can become the engine for micro-economic reform in the labour market. Progress through cooperation and, where= ever possible, agreement is the difficult path, but the alternative approach of change imposed without cooperation or agreement simply provides a recipe for social disruption.
       </para>
       <para>
        Change in the name of progress achieved through conflict and social disruption is not my vision of Australia or our common future, nor is its promotion a part of my concept of the role of government in a democracy. We ignore recent lessons from the international experience at our own peril. The difficult task in relation to change, that of creating the economic and social circumstances or infrastructure in which sustainable change can occur, has been one of the Hawke Government's greatest achievements.

        There has been an attitudinal change which accepts the economic imperative that change must occur if we are to maintain our high living standards into the future. For the first time ever in this country, for example, wages now have a structural link to productivity. Wage negotiations are not just a vehicle for distributing the benefits, but also for improving our productive capacity, our national wealth and our living standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        These issues bring me to my portfolio responsibilities. As Minister for Science and Technology it was suggested in the Australian Financial Review that I had been parked in this particular ministry. I refute that suggestion emphatically. Whatever the future may hold for me, I see my appointment as a great honour, and the task ahead of me as one of immense importance to this Government and indeed to the future of this nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Science and technology are the hallmarks of our age. They lie behind our greatest achievements and some of our greatest threats. They shape our lives more profoundly than perhaps anything else. The harnessing of science and technology to the task of addressing the challenge we face as a nation is arguably one of our most important goals. I pay tribute to my predecessor, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for his untiring championship of this view.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must ensure that Australia gets the greatest value and benefit from its research and innovation. We must ensure that through science and technology Australia's industries are more efficient and competitive and new industries are generated, that our environment is protected, that our natural resources are well managed, and that the health and safety of the Australian people are safeguarded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Historically Australian science and technology have yielded great benefits for Australia's agricultural and mineral industries. Their future contributions to these industries will be just as, if not more, important as the industries become more technology intensive and as international markets become more competitive. In particular we must make greater use of research and innovation in the crucial task of adding value to our primary industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the primary industries will remain vital sources of export earnings, they alone will not resolve our balance of payments problems. We must also make our manufacturing and service industries more competitive, as it is in these sectors that international trade is growing most rapidly. I do not believe we can do this without science and technology, and it is one area of scientific research and application where I propose to take a close interest. The need in these sectors is not only to develop new high technology companies but also to use science and technology to create, right across these industries, the productive culture that I discussed earlier as the goal of labour market reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another area that I want to pay particular attention to relates to environmental protection and sustainable development. There is, I believe, insufficient recognition that science and technology provide the key to integrating economic and environmental objectives, to converting `sustainable development' from an uncertain concept to an attainable goal. Without improved technologies and without policies that are firmly based on science, it is hard to see how we will be able to resolve in any rational way the growing conflict over economic development and environmental protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that greater awareness of this `green' role of science and technology will be an important factor in influencing more young people to pursue studies and careers in science and engineering. The drift of students, especially the brightest of them, away from science courses at the tertiary level has grave implications, not only for Australian science but for Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, the wide significance of science and technology will require me to work closely with many of my ministerial colleagues and I look forward to this collaboration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has recognised the crucial importance of science and technology. Under the Hawke Government Australia's total expenditure on research and development has substantially increased in real terms. Most importantly the Government's 150 per cent tax incentive for industrial research and development and other initiatives has stimulated the business sector, historically the weakest component of Australia's research system, to more than double its research and development spending. The Government has also implemented a wide range of changes to the research structure aimed at giving Australia a stronger, more effective and more productive research system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not deny that there have been problems or that problems remain. Certainly the redirection, restructuring and reorganisation that have been necessary, and are occurring not only in Australia but in all industrial nations, combined with the constraints on government expenditure imposed by Australia's economic situation, have created difficulties in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the universities and elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Government has taken a number of steps to address these difficulties, notably those announced in last year's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and my predecessor, the former Minister for Science and Technology, and in the Prime Minister's campaign policy speech. These initiatives are specific and concrete. The Opposition has not had the opportunity to take such initiatives because it has been out of office too long, but its record does not exactly inspire confidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another measure of the significance the Government and Opposition attach to science and technology, what the leaders say about the issue and how often. It may sound a trivial point, but it does have an underlying significance. It is rather like the number of job advertisements being regarded as one of the best guides to the current state of the economy. In this context I would like to quote from the editorial of the latest issue of Search, the official publication of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. The editorial reports the number of words devoted to science and technology in the policy speeches of the last election. The scores were:
       </para>
       <para>
        Hawke, ALP 320 words (approximately 10% of the total), Peacock, Liberal Party, 40, (0.4%). Of the other parties Haines, Democrats, scored 300 (2%), with Blunt, National Party, making no mention of science even though Mr Peacock's only allusion to the topic was to suggest that the emphasis for research should be shifted back to primary industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a desperately limited view of science. Being out of office, the Opposition can only talk about science, but it cannot even do that sensibly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The goals that Australia must achieve in the area of science and technology can be summed up in three words: excellence, cooperation and application. The first, excellence, is the least of our problems. This country has an outstanding record of scientific achievement. We can be proud of the international standing of our scientific institutions such as the CSIRO and our universities. Our task then is to maintain and further enhance the high quality of our research.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the other two areas, cooperation and application, our record has been less good and decidedly patchy. We must increase interaction between different research groups to avoid unnecessary duplication, to coordinate and strengthen our research effort in particular areas, and to improve scientific and technical education and training. There are undoubtedly effective links between science and industry sectors such as agriculture and minerals, but even here we need to strengthen relationships, especially to add greater value to these products.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in the manufacturing and service sectors that links between public sector research and private sector commercial activity are the weakest and where Australia must achieve a greater return on its investment in relevant areas of research. This requires a greater recognition by business of the importance of building up its research and development capacity and better relationships between industry and the universities and research institutions. This is happening, but it must be taken further. I firmly believe that industry will be convinced of the importance of research only when it can see the benefits at the micro-economic level; that is, in terms of the profitability of individual companies, not by general arguments about the necessity for more research. It is a key reason why I and the Government see the decision to establish a range of cooperative research centres as one of the most significant and exciting developments in Australia's future. I will elaborate on that at a future stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        To conclude, in my previous positions I have always had regard to the national interest and not simply a sectional one. Anything I have achieved has come through my involvement in the trade union movement, a movement broadly representative of the community. A single voice, quite frankly, has no capacity to deliver.
       </para>
       <para>
        The trade union movement has delivered over the past seven years; the Government has also delivered. I see my role in the House and as a Minister in the Government as building on the Labor Government's collective achievements. In that process I am committed to placing the national interest first and developing through consultation and cooperation the most effective mechanisms for creating a more just and equitable society, and one best equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

         â€”I follow the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who started his maiden speech with a comment that he made it in rather unusual circumstances, having spoken a number of times in the chamber before. This being my eighth parliament I feel that I too am making a maiden speech in somewhat unusual circumstances, but I would say to all members of the House that the differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives are sufficient to ensure that I do feel a maiden and to appreciate the courtesy which is afforded to me in giving me a maiden speech.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I regard it as a great privilege to be a member of the House. I went back to my maiden speech in the Senate in the course of thinking about this speech. I was probably the first person to read it, certainly to reread it, in the history of this Parliament. I was relieved to find that in my maiden speech in the Senate I confessed to an earlier preference for this chamber. That came from my early contact with it and, I suppose, from the fact that my father was a member of this place. But I do think that the representative nature of this chamber, the fact that it is the place where in the main governments are made and unmade, does make it a particular privilege to be a member here. I acknowledge that and I thank my electors for the opportunity.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would, however, wish to say that I share the disappointment of a majority of my electors and the party people who gave me support that I have come here not as part of a Liberal and National Party majority, but to take part in another term in Opposition. That is a severe disappointment to me and to the many people who worked hard for my election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to touch in this maiden speech on the role of this House, and to say a little about the state of the nation and its relationship to the low regard for the political process in 1990 and about some of the core issues that we must address. I also must thank, not just as a matter of form, the many people who helped me to gain election to this chamber, first of all the electors themselves, who gave me a substantial majority. I thank them not just for their voting support but for the early education that they gave me in the difference that is involved in representation in this chamber. I must say that the environmental groups in my electorate showed some prescience. They seemed to pay me a great deal of attention, and I thank them for the early education that they gave me in their concerns. I also acknowledge, having been able to raise some of those concerns in the other chamber, the readiness of the Government to respond to the concerns they expressed, for example, about the Bushmead rifle range land, which is now the subject of an environmental impact statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also wish to thank my Party. I think with one honourable exception, all of us are here because we carry the imprimatur of our respective political parties. I also acknowledge that I particularly value the connection with the Liberal Party in the seat of Pearce for one very simple reason. I do not think this can be said of the Party throughout Australia, but in the seat of Pearce the Liberal Party is deeply rooted in the community. I believe that the close contact it gives me with the different interests in the community is of enormous value.
       </para>
       <para>
        I give one very simple example of why I have such a deep respect for them. Unlike the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I was not able to be at Gallipoli on Anzac morning, but I was able to attend a dawn service at a very historic place in my electorate, Blackboy Hill camp, where tens of thousands of Western Australians trained before they went away to serve Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of that dawn service-which, in its own way, was a deeply impressive service-we stood before a fine memorial near a pine tree which had come from Lone Pine, and I noticed a group providing tea, coffee and scones to those who had attended the service. I found it was my local Liberal Party branch which year after year without any labelling or advice as to who they were simply attended that ceremony and provided refreshment. I must say that I am delighted to be associated with people of that ilk.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to thank my father, who gave me an extraordinarily good example which I have perhaps not always been able to follow to my or his satisfaction, but he gave me a respect for the political process, which I think is unusual in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I would like to thank the Senate, a chamber for which I have the greatest respect and which taught me that parliament can actually play a useful role beyond the role of an electoral college for the selection of a Prime Minister and a government. It taught me that the legislative process is something which could be done better in this Parliament. I take great heart from the expressions of concern that have been made by some long-serving members of the House of Representatives about the need to change and improve the processes in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might say that my education came not only from the Senate but also from the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who, when I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and he was the Chairman of my back bench committee, subjected every piece of legislation to the most detailed and searching scrutiny. No single piece of legislation that I introduced came to the chamber without having been improved in a process of change that was essentially carried out by the honourable member for Dundas and his back bench helpers. It taught me that all wisdom does not reside in the Executive Government and does not reside in the bureaucracy. I think we grossly underutilise the skills of elected members in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President-sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker: I have undertaken to make a small donation to my favourite charity each time I make that mistake, so you should egg me on, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would not have felt entitled to make comments about the House of Representatives had not so many been made by honourable members both opposite and behind me. The Prime Minister acknowledged on the first day the need for improvement, and the Leader of the Opposition made some very strong suggestions about the need for change. I was struck by what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) said in his maiden speech, which I thought was one of the finest that I have heard in this Parliament. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the contest between the Executive and the Parliament, I am for the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with that comment, but I want to say something about the difficulty of translating that into action. As I have said, I think there is a real capacity in the Parliament to play a greater part particularly in the legislative process. There is, however, a general reluctance of governments to see that happen. As I have said, my own committee experience shows me that legislation can be improved by allowing parliamentarians to make a contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to tell the House of my experience when, as a member of the Executive, I sought to get greater parliamentary involvement by supporting the idea of there being a Scrutiny of Bills Committee in the Senate. I originally put that idea forward as a back bench member of the Senate, because it seemed to me that we were running out of senators like Reg Wright and Peter Durack, people who were prepared to make the painstaking effort of examining Bills to see whether they contained breaches of fundamental principle. I put forward that suggestion. It was then put forward by an all-party committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, for consideration by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        By that time I had become a member of the Fraser Government, which said that it did not like the idea at all. I was sent off into the Senate to explain why my idea was such a bad one. I am pleased to report that the senators thought my explanation crass and not worth considering. They promptly, over the objections of the Executive Government, established the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The nice ending of the story for me was that, as the Minister representing the then Minister for Primary Industry, I was able to accept the first two amendments to legislation made on the recommendation of that Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point of that story is this: I know of no example of the Executive Government readily giving up its prerogatives and control where that control can be exercised in a legislative chamber. I would say to members of the Government party in particular that it is peculiarly in their hands during this Parliament whether Parliament is used or abused. If honourable members opposite believe that this Parliament has a role, if the fine things which are said about it mean anything, then it will require them to ensure that their leaders do not abuse this place, whether it is by the abuse of Question Time or the truncation of debate on important issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        A couple of years ago in the Senate we had a debate, over a month, on the industrial relations legislation of the Government. The equivalent debate in this chamber was less than a day. I believe that, given the centrality of that legislation to our national fortunes, that is an example of a quite wilful and wrongful truncation of debate. But it is only the majority party which can do anything about it. Of course, the test of our sincerity will be when we are the majority. I can only say that I hope that we, too, live up to our rhetoric.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do wish to acknowledge, however, one sign of hope. Thus far I have been involved in only one committee stage debate in this chamber. I thought it would be useless for me to intervene, but I raised with the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is presently at the table, concerns that I had about the effectiveness of the environmental protections under the treaty between Indonesia and Australia relating to the Timor Gap. I acknowledge that within 24 hours he responded to me and said that the Government would seek changes to the arrangements to take into account the difficulties that I had raised. I acknowledge that as an example of the reality of parliamentary involvement. I thank the Minister at the table for it, and I hope that it is a sign that we are moving into better times.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me now touch on the state of our nation. In a sense, it is a difficult thing to do, because so much of the debate in here seems to be taking place in a foreign country. How seldom in this first fortnight I have spent in this chamber have I heard any real acknowledgment of the state of the nation. I look at honourable members opposite; in some cases I have met some of their electors because I campaigned against them-sadly, unsuccessfully in the case of those of them who are here. But some of those electors were in deep distress. There is no sense of that distress in the words that I have heard from the Prime Minister or from the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we wonder why people hold Parliament in contempt, it seems to me that the reason lies less in the truncation of debate-because they find much of our debate odious and pointless-but more in the irrelevance of our debate to their concerns. I am of the view that this country has major problems, that our debt position is not sustainable, that the declines in our living standards are inevitable, that we face a potential crisis, and yet there is no hint of that in the smug and self-satisfied utterances, in particular of the Deputy Prime Minister. I would say that the people of Australia who are feeling the pain would be contemptuous of much that is said, not least in Question Time, in justifying what is to them unjustifiable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say that the besetting sin in Australia is that we continually look back and congratulate ourselves on being better than we were yesterday. I must say that the honourable member for Hotham, who has laboured long and hard to improve one of the most appalling aspects of Australian life, namely, our industrial relations system, is entitled to say that things are better than they were. That is not the test. The test is: are we as good as those with whom we have to compete? We need to look sideways and ahead, instead of always harking back. Unless we look sideways and ahead we will fail to see our own need for change.
       </para>
       <para>
        I gather it is proper to be non-contentious in a maiden speech, so I do not wish to criticise harshly what has been said by the honourable member for Hotham, but when I hear Labor members of parliament telling me that the trade union movement is concerned with the promotion of the rights and freedoms of the individual-I acknowledge that that is sometimes true-I have to say that for many Australians it is often an instrument of oppression and a means of depriving them of their freedoms. Let me give the House the simplest and gentlest example that I can.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am married to a very nice woman who stands about five feet four inches tall. For part of her life, since she has raised our children, she has done interior decorating work, often working in convents. She has had furniture made by a sheltered workshop-something I think all honourable members would think is a good idea-and experienced Australians with mental disabilities, who are delivering furniture to a group of aged nuns in a convent which is being restored, sent away because they are members of the wrong union. To see nuns, mentally disabled Australians and my inoffensive wife bullied by these people is just one example of what happens a thousand times a week in our country. That is why the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has the total support of the Opposition parties in the pursuit of reform in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is good in the trade union movement should be restored, and I would fight to the death for the right of an individual to join a trade union. I accept that in repressive societies trade unions are repressed, But far too often trade unions in this country usurp their role and deprive individual Australians of their rights and freedoms. Enough is enough, and it should end.
       </para>
       <para>
        I had one other example to bring, but time does not permit. It related to a man in his late sixties, who works with stained glass-an artist-who was continually pushed off building sites by bullies. That is part of the picture too. I think the honourable member for Hotham is a good Australian doing his best for Australia. He would do a lot better if he was prepared to condemn the ugly side of the movement he so ably led.
       </para>
       <para>
        That leaves me little time to talk about the other essential issues that face us. I must, I think, touch on the issue of the environment, the responsibility for which I have been given by the Leader of the Opposition. I would like to congratulate environmentalists. I do so because they have changed the debate. The whole scene has been changed-not just in a few years, it goes back many years now-by people who saw early that we needed to be much more careful of our world. The truth is that the battle, in one sense, has been won. There is no government today that could afford to ignore the importance of sustaining our environment. That is a great victory for those who argued that issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real challenge now is to move from the general to the particular. I would like to put one point on the record before I sit down. It is very important that the community, and particularly young Australians, understands that the major environmental difficulties we face in the world are a product of some splendid achievements. When I left university 30 years ago a great part of the world was starving and poor. It is true that today substantial populations have become prosperous and, in any historical sense, well-off.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a process which I am desperate to see continue. I think that poverty is a dreadful scourge. I, like the World Commission on Environment and Development, believe that we will ease the remaining poverty in the world by continued economic growth. I believe we have the skill and the capacity to do that in a way which will preserve the world and leave our children not just a better economic situation but a better environment as well. I join with the honourable member for Hotham in his belief that our scientists and technologists have a great contribution to make.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to face this on the basis that we can achieve great things because if we do not set out on that basis we will not achieve great things. Preserving a wonderful environment, but relieving the poverty which is still too evident in much of the world, is a splendid challenge for us. I hope that in this Parliament we will see a real attention to the practical difficulties that we face in bringing those twin aims together. The honourable member for Hotham, in his previous life, was critical of the Government's failure in that area. I hope that his accession to the Ministry will enable it to give a better performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the House for its indulgence. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence, and I look forward to participating in this House.

         â€”Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you on your ascension to that position. It is a pleasure to follow too such eminent maidens as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). Indeed, speaking on the Address-in-Reply today reminds me of the first time I came into this House in February 1985, when I had the honour to lead the debate. Many of the themes touched on in my speech at that time are still relevant today, more than five years later; not just because I have maintained my own interest in them but also because they are of interest and import to the people in my electorate of Cowan and because the Hawke Government has achieved many significant reforms in these areas, as in so many others.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Then, as now, I expressed concern in the areas of taxation, housing, child-care, youth, employment, peace and disarmament and I acknowledge the impressive level of progress made in these areas in the past five years. Of course, more remains to be done, and will be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, as then, I pledge myself to the electors of Cowan to work conscientiously on their behalf both in this place and outside it, and to make every endeavour to improve the positions of individuals, families and specific groups of people in my electorate.
       </para>

        As some honourable members will be aware, my electorate was redistributed in 1989 in the context of the Western Australian redistribution which saw the honourable member for Pearce come into this place. It now contains the suburbs of Woodvale, Morley and Noranda and part of Dianella, having lost its links with the Western Australian coast in the process. I note the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his place here and regret the leaving of my colleague Allen Blanchard-that is not to say that the new honourable member for Moore will not do a good job.
       </para>
       <para>
        My contact with these new areas since the redistribution and during the election campaign assures me that many of the residents support the Government's policies on major portfolio areas such as the environment which, of course, was a major issue during the election campaign; employment, education and training; social security; social justice; and community services and health. Most of these people also recognise the seriousness of Australia's economic position and, accordingly, agree with the need for difficult decisions to be made to improve the situation. This does not mean that they necessarily like the impact of all of these decisions, of course.

        However, as the honourable member for Hotham pointed out earlier in this debate, and as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said in the past, Australians have shown their ability to look beyond the limitations of their circumstances as individuals and see the nation's needs as being more important. This maturity of view is gratifying, but also very necessary in stringent economic times. Acknowledgment of this view does not imply that members on this side are unaware of the restraint exercised by some people and the difficulties confronted by many others. We are deeply conscious of such problems and are actively involved in ensuring that their position improves, as does the position of the nation.

        The Governor-General's address outlines the Government's realistic yet far-reaching program for the period immediately ahead. I am delighted to add my support for the two overriding and complementary goals it contains, that is, the establishment of a stronger more competitive and environmentally sustainable Australian economy and the creation of a fairer and more compassionate Australian society. In the context of these goals, which would probably be shared by most Australians, I am confounded by the Opposition's turnaround on the consumption tax question. Never was there such a stark example of an impost which would simultaneously harm the economy and jeopardise the fairness and equity which our tax and social security systems are finally exhibiting as a consequence of the Hawke Government's reforms in recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although I have never been an advocate of a consumption tax personally because of its inherent regressivity, elementary economics should dictate to even its most ardent supporters that its imposition would have a dampening effect on demand as well as an inflationary impact. Only a fool would want to risk that outcome at a time when our economy is in a downturn which requires sensitive management and fine tuning, certainly not the bludgeon of another tax. The agenda of proponents of such a tax must indeed be that attributed to them already in this forum-the redistribution of wealth from the poor, the struggling, the young and the aged to the rich and secure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was amazed to see the Opposition's duplicity on the consumption tax issue come to the fore so early in the parliamentary term. No sooner is the election over than it is blatantly abandoning a major plank of its policy. Unfortunately for the public I suspect that the same lack of constancy would have occurred if it had attained government. By contrast, during the election campaign the Government committed itself to not introducing a consumption tax and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has reiterated and reinforced that position in recent days, as has the Prime Minister.

        The training shortfall in Australia presents a serious barrier to the achievement of our nation's full potential for prosperity and productivity. At the micro-economic level its lack also inhibits the capacity, flexibility and competitiveness of our firms. Families in my electorate, as elsewhere in Australia no doubt, are very concerned about the availability of proper, structured training opportunities for their children, whether these be traineeships, apprenticeships or other forms of training. They recognise that education and training will improve the chances of their children, and more frequently these days themselves, to obtain and retain satisfying employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our Government continues to place the appropriate emphasis on this area of policy development and does the hard work necessary to have those policies implemented at the coalface. For instance, the training guarantee, which was passed through this House last night, will require employers to spend a minimum amount on training. Where they spend less than the required minimum the shortfall will be collected and used to fund additional training. It is therefore a measure aimed at encouraging firms which do not currently invest in training to take the plunge or forgo the funds which may otherwise have been utilised in that manner so that they may be applied to training in another area. Industry benefits directly and indirectly from a trained and experienced work force. It is only right and proper that it should make a substantial contribution to the costs involved in achieving that end, given government and public responsibility for other areas of education in the early part of people's lives.

        I do not think that honourable members opposite are aware of all the improvements that have been made by the Hawke Government in employment and training, but I do know that most of them value the Skillshare projects in their electorates. I for one am proud to be the Chairperson of the North Syde Skillshare project. I think that people in Australia need access, whatever their ages, to those sorts of facilities and training opportunities. I would recommend to every new member in this place to get involved in those projects.

        It is with great humility that I rise today to address the House of Representatives of the people of this great nation. I am humbled not by the occasion but rather by the awesome responsibility placed on me by the people who live in and are the electors of La Trobe. In recent years many members in this House seem to have forgotten that it is their basic responsibility to represent the people of their electorates and to make laws representing the will of the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        With my rising today the people of La Trobe send a clear message to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that this Hawke Labor Government has lost touch with the people, with their aspirations, their hopes, their dreams, their pains and their frustrations. It is my fervent hope that in this and future sessions of Parliament we as a body address the concerns of the majority rather than pandering to the dictates of the vocal few and the professional minority groups who so clearly attract the attention of the print and electronic media and through the media dictate the form and substance of debate. It is, in my view, long past time that we listened to the pleadings of our constituents and made laws which address the outpourings of their concerns.

        La Trobe is a most unusual electorate. It is arguably the most beautiful in the whole of our nation. It encompasses the Dandenong Ranges and surrounding foothills, with magnificent forests, reservoirs, parks, farms, small villages and only on the fringes, bits of typical outer Melbourne suburban sprawl. We have very little major industry in La Trobe, but thousands of small businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        La Trobe is a diverse electorate, both physically and socially. Concern for the maintenance and enhancement of our natural environment is an understandable priority for many of our residents. Because of the great beauty of the Dandenongs, there is an ongoing debate encompassing the relative priorities of absolute conservation, development and tourism. That debate will continue. We suffer from inadequate infrastructure, including poor roads and lack of public transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our people have been devastated by the economic policies of this Government, not least by the blunt sledgehammer effect of high interest rates. The combination of high interest rates with increasing absolute tax load has forced many families into two-income status. The Institute of Family Studies has recently described La Trobe residents as Melbourne's new poor.

        There are many policy issues which need to be addressed to solve our economic crises, but none is more urgent than the reform of our archaic, antiquated and irrelevant method of setting wages and conditions of employment. Any system which has as its basis a court where matters which ought to be the subject of negotiation are argued out between barristers and settled by the judiciary must be based on and lead to confrontation. An accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), representing powerful trade unions, and a Labor Government imposes decisions made by the very few through a confrontationist court on the hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of working men and women in this country.

        As the Iron Curtain in Europe has dissolved, so must be blown away the power and vested interest of big unions, big government and big business. It has in the past decade become commonplace for politicians on both sides of the fence and the media to constantly use the phrase `the union movement'. I admit to great confusion over the use of such terminology. On the one hand, I thought that the phrase referred to a time in history when the downtrodden and exploited working class joined together in voluntary unions to fight for their rights as individuals within an emerging development of industry and where their efforts were clearly being exploited by owners and bosses. On the other hand, I wonder whether the unions are moving out of the industry, out of the State or out of the nation. Perhaps my confusion is founded in my own belief that in this decade of this century our need to protect the downtrodden masses from the barons of commerce and industry no longer has relevance.

        It is clear that management in Australia has many sins of which it has need to repent. Not least among those sins is the apparent and frequent inability of management to communicate effectively to employees such important criteria as goals, objectives, standards and the overall economic and financial constraints under which any company operates at any point in time. The whole game, in my view, is about people and about communication. But while I castigate management for less than spectacular or progressive performance, I must also acknowledge that the system and the club have operated in such a manner as to keep management remote from their people and simple skills in such a simple concept as collective bargaining undeveloped.

        If we care to listen to them, the people out there in the streets, on the farms, in the countryside and in the towns are saying that big is no longer beautiful. They are saying that we in this place must give them more control over their own lives and their own destinies. This country was founded by people with an indomitable will and spirit to achieve and succeed despite the odds. That spirit and that will still live and still breathe.

        Iron-fisted dominance by this Government, in partnership with powerful unions, has sapped our entrepreneurial strength. There are many thousands of individuals in our country-and I have spoken to hundreds of them in La Trobe-who have the vision and the will to expand or create small business, enterprises which in turn have the capacity to replace imports and create new exports, to help reverse our most serious balance of payments problems. But they have neither the will nor the capacity to fight the combined power of this bureaucratic government and powerful unions. They will not proceed or expand until government gives them the opportunity to settle wages and conditions of employment with their employees without outside interference. Until we take confrontation and dominance out of the system and give individual employers and employees the opportunity to work together towards common goals benefiting both, we will achieve nothing but mediocrity.

        I support the right of individuals to join with their peers in trade unions for the purpose of negotiation with management.

        In that context it is appropriate, I think, to refer to the reformation at Robe River Iron Associates in 1986. That reformation included a decision by management to manage and massive changes to workplace practice. Those changes were not wrought without some pain, but the ongoing benefits have been dramatic. I note an increase in production from 951 tonnes per wage employee per month in 1986 to 2,224 tonnes per month from February 1987 to September 1989-an increase of 233 per cent. Robe now claims it has one of the most highly paid work forces in the Pilbara.

        The key to success is to establish the link between productivity and employee well-being, a link so sadly not evidenced in the club system. At present unions concentrate on getting higher nominal wages for their members by going to the IR Commission or participating in the accord rituals. But it is higher real wages which make their members better off and the IR Commission is neither structured nor motivated to see beyond the `money illusion' to the productivity/real wage connection.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet understanding that connection is critical. There is genuine `magic pudding' to be had.

         â€”The Address-in-Reply debate gives an opportunity to members to participate in a wide-ranging discussion of matters of importance not only to government but to the Parliament. It has also been in this the Thirty-sixth Parliament a chance for some of the 33 new members of this House to give their maiden speeches. To the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) I offer my congratulations on their first speeches in this House. I also, as tradition has it, offer my congratulations to Mr Speaker on his re-election and to the Chairman of Committees on his re-election.

        I consider it an honour to be able to serve as a deputy chairman of committees in this place with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because your career has been distinguished. Having previously been a Speaker, you add something to the affairs of this chamber that others cannot. I wish to refer to your contribution as the honourable member for Corio in this debate and look forward to the deliberations of the Procedure Committee under your chairpersonship because I believe that the comments that you made about the need for this Parliament to assess the ways in which it can become more relevant to the community are very important.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, this debate is part of the traditions of this place. I know that the motion that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, sponsored and that was carried by this House back in late 1988 was an attempt to make this procedure as part of the opening of a new parliament more relevant when you suggested that perhaps it was an anachronism for the members of the House of Representatives to have to traipse across to the other place to listen to the Governor-General's address. I believe that we do have the facilities in this new Parliament House to be able to make that step take place in a more neutral position; whether it be the Members' Hall or the Great Hall, I do not really mind, but it is relevant that we change the ways of the Parliament and modify and modernise some of the traditions of this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, you spoke of the need to make the procedures of the Parliament more relevant to the community that we represent. I have a firm belief that the committee system of this House can play an important part in that process. I take it very much as an honour to have been appointed this morning Chairman to one of those standing committees, the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, because I see that these committees, through the different ways that they have developed of bringing the Parliament to the people, can perhaps redress some of the problems that were mentioned by both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the first day of sitting and which have subsequently been referred to by other people.

        We should not be judged purely on the behaviour of this chamber at the height of the contest of Question Time. We should be judged by our overall efforts. If in that judgment we should be seen to be making ourselves more accessible, I am all for that. I believe that over the last Parliament all the standing committees proceeded in a direction that would assist that. Because of the breadth of subjects that were looked at and some of the very innovative ways in which those committees were conducting their inquiries, we have gone a long way to helping people to better understand what we are about and to be able to be involved more, whether it be through seminars and workshops that some committees have tried or whether it be through the avenue of newsletters that have also been circulated by committees, I am not really fussed, but I believe that the committees will continue to address not only that problem of the apparent distance between the parliamentary process and the people but also the perception that we are people who just come here for some sort of joy and see our role as one of prestige and a prominent position.
       </para>
       <para>
        It often dismays me that this Parliament House is sometimes referred to as a politicians' palace because I believe it really should be seen as the people's palace, something that people should embrace and see very much as important to their lives day in and day out.

        As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are acutely aware, in Victoria we stood under new boundaries brought upon us by a redistribution. I wish briefly to dwell upon the changes made to the seat of Scullin. The seat of Scullin, under previous boundaries, had consistently high indicators of the disadvantage of the areas that were contained. The changes in the new electorate have been dramatic.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at some of the indicators and changes in some of the figures of the new electorate, we can see that comparison. For instance, based on the last census figures, under the old boundaries 15.9 per cent of families had an income of under $12,000. That figure for the new electorate is 10 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of families with income over $40,000 has increased from 17 per cent to 22.8 per cent. In many ways the new electorate very much represents a microcosm of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the new electorate of Scullin 86 per cent of households are occupied by either owners or purchasers, with over 25 per cent of householders paying monthly mortgage payments of over $500 at the time of the census. We can imagine that the impost on families for mortgage repayments in the present climate is much greater.
       </para>
       <para>
        The population of the new Scullin continues to have a high percentage of people who were born overseas. One feature of the old Scullin was that 38 per cent of the people were born overseas and, while this has fallen to 31.7 per cent, it is still high by any standards and in comparison with average figures for the State of Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new Scullin varies from pockets of conspicuous consumption to areas of great poverty and need. The new Scullin comprises parts of three new municipalities: the City of Whittlesea, the City of Preston and the Shire of Diamond Valley. In the early 1980s an indicator of disadvantage was developed for use in the disadvantaged schools program. This indicator of disadvantage, updated to 1984 by local government area, allows for useful comparisons. The lower the score, the greater the disadvantage. Preston scored 39.4, Whittlesea scored 46.5 and Diamond Valley scored 59.7. I think that those figures indicate the range and differences across the electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In one census collector district in the eastern portion of the new electorate 21.3 per cent of the population have diploma, degree or higher qualifications, but in another census collector district in the older, western part of Scullin the difference in the figure is massive and alarming. Here, only 2 per cent of the population have diploma, degree or higher qualifications. In the spirit of the Government's social justice strategy I am committed to reducing this relative inequality. While we might well strive to become the clever country, we must also continue to strive to become a fairer country where, to paraphrase the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), a person's chances in life do not rely or depend upon his or her address.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my maiden speech in 1986 I spoke of large sections in Broadmeadows which are no longer in the electorate of Scullin and which had been badly planned and set up with no support services during the 1950s. In the new Scullin the mistakes of the 1950s have been replicated in the 1970s and the 1980s. The City of Whittlesea is the fastest growing municipality in Victoria. Over the past decade large areas have been opened up by developers ahead of a program for the provision of appropriate infrastructure and services. There is a need to address this problem that is common to the fringes of our cities. This goes to the heart of the Government's outer urban strategy. Although this strategy was announced during the election, it is wrong to suggest that it was motivated by the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        In April last year in a contribution in this place I referred to the dramatic growth that is anticipated in the Plenty corridor which will see the City of Whittlesea grow from 80,000 to 200,000 by the turn of the century. I argued that infrastructure will be needed across the whole social wage. These things have to be planned for, and planned for well. There were many elements of the Government's policy during the election that were reiterated in the Governor-General's Speech and will be of direct benefit to electorates such as Scullin. I welcome the Government's commitment to an active social policy and to the creation of a fairer society where opportunities are open to all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier I referred to the relative disadvantage that could be found in the Scullin electorate in relation to educational opportunity. In this regard I welcome the commitment to make a special allocation of $30m in 1991 and 1992 to assist in improving facilities and equipment for schools. I also welcome the Government's commitment to equality of opportunity in education through expansion of the disadvantaged schools program and a new program to improve literacy and learning skills.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also made a commitment to further improve the supply and affordability of child-care. This will be of significant benefit in the Scullin electorate. An additional 50,000 community child-care places will be provided Australia-wide by 1995-96, including 10,000 new centre based places, 10,000 family day-care places and 30,000 new outside school hours-care places. The existing fee relief system for users of community based child-care is to be improved to ease the cost of child-care for low and middle income families and extended to part of the private child-care centres. It is estimated that an additional 28,000 new places will be provided by employers and private centres as a result of this decision. I also welcome the Government's commitment to establish family resource centres and to extend marriage counselling and family mediation services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision to assist with the improvement of public transport is a significant and positive initiative. As I indicated earlier, the need for significant national investment in infrastructure has long been recognised. The November 1987 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport Communication and Infrastructure entitled Constructing and Restructuring Australia's Public Infrastructure noted many of the issues that will face Australia before the turn of the century. With regard to physical infrastructure, the Committee noted that the 1990s will be the decade in which the ageing of the Australian infrastructure begins to impose serious costs. The overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure led the Committee to conclude that the maintenance and replacement needs will increase substantially during the rest of this century. Unless this need due to ageing can be offset by savings through lower demand elsewhere, aggregate need for investment must rise. The same is true for social infrastructure.

        In education the Committee found that the demand for technical and further education and higher education places will continue to grow over the next 15 to 20 years. The Committee also found that the demand in health infrastructure will rise significantly in the period to the year 2000. In particular, as a result of Australia's ageing population, the Committee anticipated a rapid rise in demand for the types of infrastructures needed by the aged, including medical facilities. The agenda for urban strategy, with special reference to matters of social and physical infrastructure, has therefore been outlined for some time. Improving public transport, providing child-care and improving education facilities as part of this process of renewing our cities and catching up shortfalls in service provisions are properly matters for the Federal Government. I welcome this commitment to active social policy.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I are two of a rare breed in this chamber-that is, Government backbenchers from the State of Victoria-I want to address my remarks to the results of the election. The election result was historic, for we have the fourth successive Hawke-led Labor Government. But there are many aspects of the result in Victoria which were disappointing. A balanced assessment must acknowledge the role of both Federal and State factors in the swing against the Party. As a Federal member, but more importantly as a resident of Victoria, it was obvious to me that there was considerable dissatisfaction in the community about the State Government. At the same time there is little doubt that concern about some policies of the Federal Government also contributed to the swing in Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cain Government has undergone reassessment of its performance and priorities and I am sure that this will lead to re-establishment of its support. In my view the success of the fourth term of the Hawke Government depends on the party's ability to give a clear direction for the next decade. The policies must be practical and achievable and equally they must offer vision and hope to the community at large. The Government has made significant achievements in developing programs of social justice to combat discrimination and oppression. Much of this achievement has taken place under difficult economic circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our most pressing task as a government must be to further extend the social justice strategy to the circumstances that determine living standards and life chances-such things as job entry, education and training, child-care, housing and transport. Specifically this will require programs designed to tackle structural and regional inequalities of income, wealth, housing, transport, education and health. I refer also to the implementation of social justice in the workplace through industrial democracy and the universal provision of education and training, and a continuation and extension of the fight to eradicate poverty. These objectives must be pursued within an appropriate environmental context. The Governor-General's Speech contains many positive signs of this approach. The Australian Labor Party will win back the support that has been lost in Victoria only by pursuing this vision of a fair Australia by an active social policy.

         â€”In September last year in this chamber I asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) relating to certain allegations that Mrs Halfpenny had made to the National Crime Authority regarding her estranged husband, John Halfpenny. The Prime Minister, in answering that question, kindly agreed to have these allegations investigated, and referred them to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). These were serious allegations and I was grateful to the Prime Minister for that course of action. Indeed, at the time I thought it was the proper course of action.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The inquiry concluded some three weeks ago, I believe. I found that out by a small piece in a couple of the newspapers which said that the inquiry had concluded and found nothing untoward. This concerned me a little because I had had a small number of reports coming to me during the inquiry that it was not, indeed, being taken seriously by the AFP and there were suggestions made to me that it was being hushed up. I had no particular evidence of that myself.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to raise certain matters here today that I hope the Prime Minister can further consider and have investigated, if he thinks fit during his recuperation, which we hope will be speedy and fruitful. I ask the Prime Minister in those considerations to release details of the extent the corruption allegations against John Halfpenny were investigated by the AFP. Is it not a fact that the corruption allegations against Halfpenny were given the lowest possible priority by the Federal Police? Is it not a fact that the matter was assigned to a junior investigator who, at the time, had never even been to Melbourne? Is it not a fact that this junior investigator was given no support and that she was largely ignorant of the ramifications of the allegations, through no fault of her own I hasten to add, and, indeed, ignorant of many of the personalities and players involved? Was not this junior investigator later relieved of the investigation and dispatched to the Melbourne office of the Federal Police?
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it not a fact that a second investigator assigned to the Halfpenny allegations promptly went on holiday for some weeks? Can the Prime Minister, perhaps at some stage in the future, assure the House that the many powerful and influential business people cited in Mrs Margaret Halfpenny's original statement to the National Crime Authority (NCA) have been questioned and investigated? Is it not a fact that few, if any, have even been questioned?
       </para>
       <para>
        Were the Federal Police given access to the transcript of a Channel 10 interview which, I believe, extends to some 86 pages in length, between investigative reporter Chris Masters and Margaret Halfpenny and, if not, why not? This interview expands in greater detail a number of her original allegations of improper behaviour. Is it not a fact that senior Channel 10 management were instructed to kill the interview, scheduled to appear on the network's now defunct Public Eye current affairs show, shortly before it went to air? I think that is of some significance because I understand Margaret Halfpenny was paid something of the order of $7,000 to do the interview and a great deal of trouble was spent in arranging to have the interview done. It would have certainly shot Channel 10's ratings up at a time when it was having trouble attracting an audience.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it not a fact that this Channel 10 interview explores Mrs Halfpenny's corruption allegations against her husband, John Halfpenny? Is it not a fact that she details many of her husband's relationships with big business and elaborates on her allegations including the awarding of the Anzac frigates contract to Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated? I believe it is imperative that the Australian Federal Police have access to that document if it is going to conduct a fair dinkum inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask further: Is it not a fact that a director of Channel 10's Northern Star, Mr Peter Redlich, was made aware of the existence of the transcript and the scheduled interview with Mrs Margaret Halfpenny? Is it not a fact that the Northern Star director, Mr Peter Redlich, is also senior partner in the legal firm of Holding Redlich, legal advisers to Blohm Voss, designers of the Anzac frigates? Is it not a fact that the same director of Northern Star and senior partner in the legal firm that I have just mentioned, representing the designers of the Anzac frigates, the same Peter Redlich, is also the legal representative of John Halfpenny?
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it not a fact that the legal firm of Holding, Redlich and Co. issued a writ of defamation against the Melbourne Herald as a result of an article written by journalist Tess Lawrence identifying Mrs Halfpenny as a National Crime Authority informant? I believe that in the light of all this, it is pertinent to ask why the NCA was relieved of the authority to investigate the Halfpenny allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to ask: Is the Prime Minister aware of an extraordinary court order issued on Mrs Halfpenny in the Family Court of 11 September 1989 instructing her not to speak to another human being on any matter relating to her marriage? Is it not a fact that this extraordinary and seemingly inhumane order was granted only a week after the Prime Minister, in this chamber, told the nation that the corruption allegations would be investigated?
       </para>
       <para>
        This court order, Mr Deputy Speaker, is indeed quite remarkable. The Family Court of Australia served this order and restrained her, and I quote, `from publishing, disclosing or communicating in any manner, whatsoever, and information relating to the marital relationship between the parties to which she has been privy in the course of the marital relationship to any person other than in a strictly formal, legal proceeding'. I point out that an even more Draconian order had been served on her only four days previously. I find that incredibly restrictive and close to a unique and improper use of the Family Court to silence this woman. It could well have hindered her giving evidence to the Australian Federal Police investigation, and I believe it certainly had little to do with dividing up the spoils of marriage which is what I thought the Family Court was supposed to be all about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question that should be asked is: Who is trying to cover up what? I believe if the Prime Minister could look into these matters and assure us that justice has not only been done but seen to be done, I think many people's minds would be put to rest.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time remaining to me I wish to pass onto another quite different matter, perhaps of even greater importance. It is relevant to the distress and hardship that has been occurring in my electorate of Parkes and in other electorates around the country, such as Gippsland and Maranoa, with the tremendous floods that we have been experiencing. We have all heard, of course-and I raised the subject in a matter of public importance in this chamber only on Monday afternoon-about the devastation to properties and to the town of Nyngan, Wanaaring and other places.
       </para>
       <para>
        The floods in my electorate covered many thousands of square kilometres. They not only flooded Nyngan, but also in the country upstream of Nyngan and downstream of Nyngan. There has also been extensive flooding north of Brewarrina in the Weilmoringle area, largely from waters which have come down from Queensland. There is also flooding across in the Wanaaring area which is causing great distress and has not received much publicity to date.
       </para>
       <para>
        We all understand, of course, the tremendous devastation that was caused to the homes at Nyngan when the levee banks burst. The inhabitants were originally told that the water would not rise any more than about 4.85 metres. It was felt they could hold it at that, but the water just kept rising and rising. The levee banks were built to 5.2 metres before they eventually burst and the river continued to rise after that. This was a flood never experienced in this area before; certainly a one in 100-year flood. As Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair in charge of the clean-up operation said, `It could well be a one in 700-year flood'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously that levee bank has to be increased from about the 4.5 metres that it was to at least 6.5 metres, if nothing else to give peace of mind to the people who will have to live in that town; who have only just moved back in on a permanent basis. To go into those houses and inspect them was a shock, even though you expect things to be bad. The water had been in them for several days and, in some cases, upwards of two weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not one of those floods we see on the coast where the water can rise overnight and disappear the next day. This was also dirty water. Furniture had crumbled, particularly modern furniture which was only held together with glue and staples. If you pick it up it falls apart in your hands. Cupboards and refrigerators, et cetera, had just floated up and tipped over causing a tremendous mess. Honourable members can imagine the damage to gyprock walls, of course. They will all have to be replaced. All paintwork will have to be replaced. Many carpets will have to be replaced, and those that do not will have to be thoroughly cleaned and dried. In many cases floorboards will have to be torn up and replaced. The dampness somehow has to be got out of these houses. Indeed, several of the houses will have to be demolished. In fact, I think it can safely be said that no house will be the same again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just on household items alone a minimum of $10,000 would barely cover costs of replacement in these areas. In many houses the costs will run up to figures as high as $80,000 to $100,000. Of course, there is no such thing in a sense of flood insurance for houses. If there were I guess the premiums would be so high that people could not afford that type of insurance. Perhaps we should look at some sort of national disaster insurance again. I know that has been looked at in the past, and members on both sides of the House have called for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cars and other vehicles are insured and that raised the anomaly that if someone earned his living from the use of a vehicle, such as a taxi driver or gravel truck driver, then his business was insured in that sense, whereas, if one's business was conducted out of premises, the damage that occurred was not insured.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a particular plight with regard to the pensioners in that area, particularly the more elderly of them. As I indicated on Monday afternoon, there are some 270 pensioners over 70 years of age. Most of them are physically incapable of doing the work that needs to be done to get their houses back in order. Also, most of them do not have the financial resources to do so. Even though voluntary groups have been magnificent in the services that they have offered-people from the neighbouring towns of Gilgandra, Cobar, Warren, Dubbo and many other places-one cannot avoid having to do many of the things oneself.
       </para>
       <para>
        In many of their cases, where they lived in old timber houses, these houses will have to be demolished and I do believe there is a reasonable chance that a recommendation will come forward that a retirement village complex may have to be constructed there. If that is the case, obviously Federal money will come into it. If that does occur I hope the Minister will look favourably upon that scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The properties surrounding Nyngan are in no less serious a plight. Many of them are still surrounded by water. Many of them will continue to be surrounded for many months to come. I did highlight the case of Doug Bambrick at Wanaaring when I spoke on Monday afternoon. He had been marooned for a month on his 110,000-acre property where he runs 12,000 sheep. He can only move around for a short distance outside his house, he has so far located 2,000 of this sheep; he has no idea where the other 10,000 are-whether they are alive or dead, whether they are being eaten by flies, or whatever. As honourable members can imagine, it is a stressful situation. His household has not had any mail for a month; it has had no communication from the outside world apart from phone, radio and television. When I put the question to him, `Well, when do you expect to get out, bearing in mind the state of the roads, the state of the bridges, et cetera?', he said, `I think, with a bit of luck, I should be able to get out round about August or September'. August or September, for goodness sake! I do not think many of us appreciate what these people are going through. In his case that means that he will not have any income until that time. He will probably have to drive many hundreds of kilometres extra, going on back roads so that he can get across. The normal routes that he would take have been washed away. It is going to be very expensive out in that area to repair these roads and bridges. I hope that when they are repaired they are repaired thoroughly.
       </para>
       <para>
        These people live in very isolated areas. Their children's education, of course, is suffering as a result. The animals on the properties are suffering. Many pregnant ewes, late in their pregnancy, are dying from pregnancy toxaemia, from the stress. I have mentioned the loss that can occur from fly strike; the loss that can occur just from the fact that the hooves of sheep which have stood in water for a week or more can, in many cases, come off particularly when the animals walk through the sticky mud. When that happens, of course, the animals die a very painful death unless they are put out of their misery by a bullet.
       </para>
       <para>
        One group I do pay tribute to, who have come in for some flack in the bush over the years, is the shearers, for the attitude that they have taken through this. In many areas they have undertaken to shear sheep on public holidays such as Anzac Day and on weekends. They have shorn sheep when they are wet. I was recently talking to one farmer, Mac George at Brewarrina, who had pregnant ewes. He said that his loss from that particular mob would have been 100 per cent but it was only 50 per cent after they were shorn. He has, of course, fleeces all over his shed drying out. It is a tribute to the shearers for what they have done in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have liked to have seen more help with the use of the State Emergency Service helicopters flying more shearers into certain areas, because it was to the benefit of the country ultimately if those sheep could have been shorn.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much has to be done in towns such as Nyngan about levee banks. I talked with the Shire President, Wally Mitchell, at Bourke for an hour the other day. The Darling River at Bourke will rise to within a metre of the top of the levee bank. Bourke will undoubtedly be safe on this occasion, but had another couple of inches fallen somewhere else Bourke could well have been flooded too-a town approximately the same size as Nyngan. The levee bank there had been neglected over the years because it was thought it was high enough. When they put a roller over it-they use a square roller which is about 14 3/4 tonnes in weight-the square roller, as you can imagine, as it comes over and the corner falls onto the bank, really compacts the bank. It lowered the levee about half a metre just by passing over the levee bank backwards and forwards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The porosity of the bank was quite unsatisfactory for the flood and many areas had to be patched up. This is an incredibly expensive exercise. Shire councils that do not have tens of thousands of ratepayers-some have only 2,000 or 3,000 ratepayers-cannot afford the cost of this. They need government assistance through both State and Federal funding. Bourke's levee bank is 10.5 kilometres long; so one can appreciate the massive job involved in getting it to the state that it should be in.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many things need to be looked at with floods, so that future damage can be allayed. Helicopters are needed for spotting sheep and lifting sheep out, which can be done for $2 to $8 a head, and for carting hay in, not only with helicopters but also with Caribous and Hercules. There is a need for deferment of the wool tax, so that people who would have shorn and sold this year, but cannot sell until next year, can have that portion of the clip deferred from the new level of wool tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many other things need to be done, such as waiving sales tax paid by the people who have to buy goods for their homes that have been flooded in Nyngan. I ask the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to look upon that favourably and for the Australian Taxation Office to look favourably upon allowing people who have lost wages, tax records and other records to adjust their provisional tax. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House will be sympathetic about that matter.

        I had intended to address a few words on some of the myths of micro-economic reform and to dwell upon some of the simplistic American solutions I heard from the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the sanctimonious, stained-glass platitudes uttered by honourable members opposite.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has excited me. I have some time for the honourable member for Parkes, who has done some good work in the Parliament. He has been courageous in speaking out on South Africa, an issue on which I generally agree with him. But today's performance, to come into the House and use broadcast time to rake up the trials and troubles of John Halfpenny and his wife, was really scraping the bottom of the barrel. The honourable member for Parkes, in his ability to heap conjecture upon innuendo and upon unsubstantiated allegation, rivals only Senator Richardson.
       </para>
       <para>
        What he did in this Parliament today was to play upon the traumas that occur in a marriage break-up. I have no particular brief for John Halfpenny and if I were his wife I certainly would have left him; but I know the traumas that occur in these situations. There was not one item of fact there. I know a fair bit about defence. I have agonised over defence and I think I could find quite a few scandals which have been buried, scandals which Opposition members have never looked at.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the tendering for the frigate process was totally above board. I was asked by both parties to get involved in that and I refused. I believe the process was totally above board and the correct decision was made. For the honourable member to impugn that decision on the basis of troubles between John Halfpenny and his wife is absolutely disgraceful. I know the things wives say to husbands, even when they are not subjected to the traumas of divorce. The honourable member ought to reconsider his attitude. He would have been far better advised to devote his entire speech to the people in his electorate who were so plagued by the problems of flooding.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say a few words about micro-economic reform, because I think that in the long run it is not something that the Government will impose on the community. It will not work unless there is a fundamental change in the ethos of Australia. I believe that the idea of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is alive and well in the work force. It has been subverted in recent times. When we have some of our entrepreneurs being able to amass for themselves enormous wealth without producing anything, simply by rorting the stock exchange, we have a bad precedent set for people who have to work to earn their living. People such as Elliott have done an enormous amount of damage in undermining the confidence of the Australian work force in the equity of the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we talk about micro-economic reform we have to be very careful. Politicians tend to take what they call the hard option. I do not think I have ever known a politician who took anything other than the hard option. It is my view that attacking Telecom Australia is not a hard option; it is a soft option. I will be resisting very strenuously in this Parliament any attacks on the viability of Telecom, because it is a unique institution in that it tends to bind the whole of Australia. In my electorate we are dependent on Telecom for services and it is one of the few institutions that provide to country people almost the same services that city people enjoy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not benefit us very much to look at waterfront reform, where we can save perhaps $1.5 billion, when the country seems to be marching down the American road and embracing the American disease of unrestrained litigation. Without doubt, litigation in the United States costs that country proportionately far more than any of the individual inefficiencies that we have in our system. It will be to our eternal detriment if we allow ourselves, as we often do, to blindly follow these American cultural manifestations.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we talk about reforms, governments and oppositions ignore some of the more fundamental things. For instance, figures have been produced which show that lack of English in the workplace costs the country $3 billion a year, which could be easily wiped out. If we embarked on a policy of determining that everyone in Australia will speak English within a decade, it could be achieved. Sadly, this is not the case. In my view, the standard of English in this country is going backwards.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that in many Aboriginal communities in my electorate the standard of English today is not as good as it was 20 years ago. We have a crying and desperate need for teachers of English as a second language in Aboriginal communities. They are not being provided because they are not seen as a priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of life's little ironies is that some people are proposing that we teach an Aboriginal language in some of our trendy middle-class schools, an achievement which would gain for Australia absolutely nothing. It is a nonsense concept. The real need is to get English in Aboriginal schools. It is a need that Aboriginals understand. It is something they are pleading for and something we have generally ignored.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that we have to change the ethos of Australia, and that will mean fundamental changes in the education system. As a member of parliament I receive letters from school kids, particularly on the environment. Recently I received a whole string of letters from one school. The letters were all different, except for a key phrase which recurred over and over again and could have come only from that particular schoolteacher. He was talking about the horrors of the greenhouse effect. He was clearly confusing it with the ozone layer, which a lot of people do. In short, he did not know what he was talking about. But I suggest that he was successfully indoctrinating those kids in misinformation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The long term cost of that is enormous because it engenders in Australia an ethos that we do not have to produce; there is no need for the nation to create; and there is no need to export-jobs will be provided somehow or other. These people seem to think that social security actually produces something. Until this problem is addressed in our schools, we will have lots of problems achieving what must be achieved in Australia.

       <para>
        A very good friend of mine, David Mulrooney, is a mining engineer who is a pre-eminent expert in Australia in deep shaft sinking, particularly in soft ground where freezing is required. He has worked all over the world and he has said to me that, without a doubt, in his experience Australian miners are the best in terms of efficiency. He has said that in terms of work done they compare very well with anyone anywhere else in the world. In no other country does he see miners with a greater level of self-sufficiency and preparedness to think and act on their own initiative than he has seen with Australian miners. That is a tribute to Australian miners and it is true of a lot of our work force. I find it quite appalling to hear the denigration that is heaped on our work force by Opposition members.

        I read in the Australian Financial Review today that the Opposition, which has waxed eloquent about labour market reforms, now opposes the amalgamation of unions.

        Fundamentally, the Opposition's position has always been the same: to divide and conquer. The power of privilege has been its forte. However else the Opposition tries to disguise it, this is what it will be trying to achieve.

         â€”It is good to see you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, knowing of your exploits as a successful Speaker in the past. I rise in this grievance debate to talk about a very important matter-something with which honourable members may not be terribly familiar-and that is the current campaign for an Australian bone marrow register to be put in place as soon as possible. It is currently being promoted in the office of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and is something that has been mooted for quite some time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not think I need to go into great detail about the enormous difficulties and problems that confront people who contract the dreaded disease of leukaemia. There are many varieties of it, and four varieties can be treated successfully with bone marrow transplants. Of course, in this day and age we are seeing enormous advances being made in the transplant field. The need to become more efficient in terms of bone marrow transplants is now coming very much to the fore in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the early 1970s there was a family in this country by the name of Nolan. One of the children contracted leukaemia and was taken to London, which had a registry of some kind, but the young fellow died. His mother got to work in the United Kingdom-it could not be done here-and got the Anthony Nolan Register going, which is famous in the world today and is in great demand. It is still the main register that Australian sufferers use to get treatment for leukaemia or to find out whether there is a person with a matching bone marrow that can be used in transplants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The demand today from leukaemia sufferers who wish to have a transplant is considerable. For example, the search for a suitable donor takes three months to institute. When the search is implemented, at least $20,000 must be raised for the search to be made and for the person who is giving the bone marrow to be brought to Australia for the transplant operation to be undertaken. We have a major dilemma, but it is something that can be overcome; something can be done about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two common forms of leukaemia-chronic myeloid leukaemia and severe aplastic anaemic leukaemia-cannot be treated in any form other than through a bone marrow transplant. Two other common forms-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia-can be treated through other methods, but bone marrow transplant is by far the most effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently in Australia we are dealing with transplanting bone marrow into 80 to 100 patients. In the instances where this is taking place, there are success rates of up to 60 per cent; whereas if the transplants did not take place, the life expectancy of those people who contracted the disease would be nil.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two-thirds of the patients who need bone marrow transplants in this country do not have a donor in the family; so it is important that the search through the registers in other countries can be undertaken, although it is a great expense. Some 200 people die of these diseases every year in Australia, and the poignancy of that is that something can be done. The matching of unrelated donors of bone marrow has been undertaken since 1984 in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are on the brink, with the talks being undertaken today with the Minister for Community Services and Health and the meetings that will be taking place between the various State Ministers and the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health, of getting an agreement between the States and the Federal ministry of Health to provide recurrent funding, which will be only $1m or $2m to start it off, for the capital equipment necessary. With the guarantees of recurrent funding that I hope will result, we will be able to get the registry going in this country, which will be quite a milestone. Many hundreds of families will be eternally grateful for the funding that will be provided by the Federal Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        My grievance is from the point of view that we have not seen anything take place with any great speed in the past. The time has come when the Minister should take some decisive action with regard to getting this bone marrow register in Australia under way as soon as possible. I commend the whole concept to him.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank Dr Jeremy Chapman, who is in Parliament House at the moment, and Mrs Laurie Dutch, who is a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council advisory committee, for coming here and bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister and the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) and shadow Minister, who has given them a sympathetic ear as he has had experience in this field during his medical career. We have his full support for the establishment of this bone marrow registry in Australia as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other thing I would like to mention is that the Springwood Lions Club, of which I am a member, has been very active over the past five or 10 years in raising funds to enable people to be sent to England to have these bone marrow transplants. I would like to place on record the fact that the club has been so diligent in terms of its fund raising. The main person behind it is Mr Joe Bourke. I commend him and all the members of the Springwood Lions Club for their splendid efforts in raising funds to make it easier for people who, under the present circumstances, have to go to London for bone marrow transplants.
       </para>
       <para>
        I bring that to the attention of the House, not necessarily as a grievance. I urge the Minister to give his careful thought and support to the discussions he is having now.

        Hypocrisy can be defined as the blatant politicking of the Queensland National Party over the western Queensland floods-and this can no longer go unchallenged. For weeks we have witnessed the spectacle of Russell Cooper tearing around Queensland trying to score political points during a time of extreme social stress. Judging by the performance given by the member for Warrego in the Queensland Parliament on Tuesday, one can only assume that the Queensland National Party is delving into the dregs of the barrel.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to compare the quick action of the Goss and Hawke governments to get emergency workers, equipment and financial assistance into flood affected areas with the poor response of the previous National Party Government in Queensland last year when Gympie was flooded. It is obvious that the Labor governments are far more compassionate and competent than the National Party was or is ever likely to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Party has declared ad nauseam that it represents the rural sector; yet the pathetic speech delivered by the member for Warrego in the Queensland Parliament clearly demonstrates that the National Party has no goals for western Queensland and, that being so, the National Party has forfeited its claim to represent these honest, hardworking people.
       </para>
       <para>
        To attack funding for the Worker's Heritage Centre whilst supposedly fighting for the interests of small business in western Queensland towns in the ultimate in hypocrisy. Tourism is vital to the survival of towns such as Barcaldine and to the expansion of job opportunities for the youngsters of western Queensland. The Worker's Heritage Centre, which was so scathingly attacked by Mr Hobbs-like the Stockman's Hall of Fame, the wool scour proposed for Blackall and numerous other venues-will open up western Queensland as a major tourist destination.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) tells me that tourism is high on his agenda for the development of his electorate. Kennedy can thank its lucky stars that it has a Labor member of his calibre and vision to oversee its future, not some lacklustre National Party mouthpiece like Mr Hobbs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Queensland National Party's attacks on Labor's handling of the floods are more hypocrisy. I am amazed that the National Party in Queensland-this discredited bunch of no-hopers-actually has the audacity to point the finger at others. When the National Party was in power, did it ever show anything near the same degree of cooperation that exists between the Federal and State governments on this occasion? No. There was no concern for suffering people. Instead, we witnessed the Canberra bashing that characterised the previous 32 years, not to mention the rorting of drought relief funds. I am sure I do not have to remind the House of that. I wonder what the National Party would have done with the money this time round. The $30m that was lost over five years through rorts on drought relief funds would have been well used to help the people who are suffering now.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have information from one Queensland Government Minister that in the shire of Jericho, the Shire Clerk, Mr Robert Millis, was in possession of vouchers from the western Queensland flood appeal for nearly a week before he condescended to distribute them to the people of Alpha-people who had lost everything; people who had nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we are talking about Alpha, an article published in the North West Star on 4 May 1990 concerns me greatly as it suggests that there might have been more than storm pollution behind the murky waters flooding this township. I am going to read a couple of paragraphs of it to honourable members:
       </para>
       <para>
        Ratepayers in the town of Alpha in the Jericho shire in Queensland's west, are concerned that their funds might have been used to cause some of the worst flooding in the town's history.
       </para>
       <para>
        Business people and residents reported that the recent flooding was in different areas to normal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many residents blamed a levee bank which had been built by the shire council across what was usually the natural watercourse during floods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Instead of following its usual course, the water stopped at the levee bank and was backed up around and into the higher parts of the town until the middle of the bank burst.
       </para>
       <para>
        A yardman at the Alpha hospital, which is next to the levee bank, said the water dropped about two feet once the levee bank burst.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is clearly a serious matter and one which I have reason to believe was spawned by the National Party's corrupt electoral system, the basis of which has been pork-barrelling of large landholders at the expense of the country towns. It is an absolute joke that the National Party runs around talking about the importance of country towns when we all know that under the present electoral system in Queensland, the people in country towns are underrepresented and the squattocracy has all the say.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coming back to the levee bank, as I understand it, a former Jericho Shire Chairman was very keen to see this levee bank completed. It may interest the House to know that on 9 October 1986 the then National Party Government in Queensland issued a special lease, No. 37/47992, for a block of land, being 1.214 hectares in area, this land being described as lot 1 on plan BE 159 in the parish of Alpha, in the district of Springsure, in the county of Belyando, for the purpose of erecting a motel and caravan park. The term of this lease was 30 years and the annual rent determined at auction was, for the first 5 years, $400 per annum, with this figure to be reappraised every five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        This particular block of land is partially within the natural watercourse formed in flood situations that I have previously referred to. The names of the lessees shown on this lease are those of the then Shire Chairman, Mr Eddy Hock; the then and present Shire Clerk, Mr Bob Millis; the then councillor for division 3 of the said Council, Mr Roley Roberts; and a Mr J. W. Andrews. Is that not a cosy little coincidence? We have a levee bank built across an escape route for floodwaters-a route, moreover, that had always been largely open ground-and when that levee bank is all but complete, we have a Queensland Government lease being sold to prominent members of the shire council.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 24 January 1990 this lease was transferred to a company trading under the name of Bethune Pty Ltd, the directors of which live within my electorate. The question of whether or not the previous lessees actually adhered to the conditions of the lease is incidental here, as is the transfer of the lease to Bethune Pty Ltd early this year. What is important to me is the considered opinion of many long term residents of Alpha that that levee bank would have greatly exacerbated, and possibly caused in its own right, the severe flooding through the body of the town.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this is so-as I believe it is vital that after any disaster we try to ascertain its cause and develop strategies that minimise future suffering-I believe that either the Queensland Government or the Federal Government, which is in fact footing a considerable share of the flood relief bill, should take a very close look at the reasons why the township of Alpha was submerged.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Kennedy cannot be here today due to his attendance at memorial services for those north Queensland local government officials who were tragically killed in the recent plane crash. However, the honourable member informed me that he discovered that while he was in Alpha trying to ascertain the needs of that community, a meeting of local officials involved in the response to the devastation wrought by the flooding was held behind closed doors at the hospital and he was not invited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member also tells me that he was highly impressed and deeply touched by the courage of the residents and business people in the town, but very disappointed that the Shire Clerk, with whom he had met the night before, did not do him the courtesy of extending to him an invitation to a meeting whose agenda was one of paramount importance to the people he represents in the Federal Parliament. Let us not forget that it is the Federal Government that is providing a substantial amount of relief money to the Jericho shire.
       </para>
       <para>
        I congratulate the residents of Alpha on their courage; the honourable member for Kennedy, who, I believe, has worn a path to the doors of numerous Ministers on behalf of the devastated areas within his electorate; and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, for the deployment of the defence forces to the shire of Jericho to undertake major road repair. It is a great pity that some of these National Party dominated shire councils do not give greater credit to just what Labor governments are really prepared to do when the chips are down.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, last week in the House I mentioned the politicising of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ). Since then representatives of the Motor Traders Association have contacted my office and told me that some two years ago the President of the RACQ, Mr Love, was very pleased to be able to say that breakdown callouts had increased dramatically, which was a surprising comment to make.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fees for inspections of motor vehicles, of course, are a major contributor to RACQ revenue. It is interesting to note that the RACQ has been a very strong opponent of compulsory testing of cars in Queensland. I have always believed that, if that were introduced, it would save lives. It seems ironic that the RACQ on the one hand is talking about improving road safety and at the same time is opposing compulsory testing of vehicles, and that it was pleased to see that the number of callouts had increased. I think that the general public, certainly members of the RACQ, will take that up at the next annual meeting. I hope that the directors of the RACQ will be thrown out for the way in which they have politicised a once great organisation.

       <para>
        The latest 1989-90 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) survey of Australia is interesting in a number of respects. It is interesting not so much for what it tells us about the Australian economy, which we all know is in dire trouble, but for what it tells us about the failures of economic policy making under this Government. The various economic commentators have all noted the OECD's call for a faster pace of micro-economic reform, the need to adopt measures to address our inflation proneness, the need to improve our productivity performance and to increase the level of fiscal restraint. By and large, the report has been seen as a call for the Government to pull its socks up, in the light of the wasted opportunities of its third term.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest survey contains, as its major subject of concern, a chapter on industrial relations reform and the labour market. As was noted at the time of the survey's release at the end of April, it is particularly critical of the Government-Australian Council of Trade Unions accord for its failure to deliver productivity growth over the past seven years. Indeed, the productivity figures contained in an annexe to the survey are a damning indictment of the centralised wage fixation system generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        We find on page 101 of the survey that productivity grew at an annual average rate of only one per cent over the period from 1980 to 1988. If we then look at the period from 1986 to 1988, we find that total productivity growth was a miserable 0.4 per cent. Despite the Government's attempted fiddle of Australian Bureau of Statistics and OECD productivity figures during the election campaign, with particular reference to the manufacturing sector, it cannot run away from these dismal economy-wide figures that I have mentioned, which have become apparent over the most recent years of the accord.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the price that this Government is forcing the country to pay for the accord and the centralised wage fixing process. Despite some job growth, for which the accord can take only a small amount of credit, our productivity and international competitiveness are virtually stagnant. Despite these figures and the magnitude of the task of structural reform identified in the survey, the OECD claims that the economy is heading for a soft landing-to use the jargon of the day-following the Government's high interest rate policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding the Government's deliberate and self-confessed engineering of a recession, the OECD now contends that we are not staring down the barrel of a 1982-83 type recession. While the media has tended to report this finding without much ado, it deserves to be met with much greater scepticism. We must remember that the OECD's economic survey is prepared on the basis of information supplied by an increasingly politicised Australian Treasury and that Treasury officials are involved in vetting and amending the draft report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The OECD also seeks to minimise the political impact of its commentary on the Government of the day. Thus, the current survey, although it was finalised in December last year and approved for release last January, was held over for release until after the Federal election, in accordance with what is apparently OECD policy. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has done his bit to minimise its subsequent impact by ignoring it to the greatest extent possible. He argues that the survey is now out of date, which is all very convenient for him, but the Treasurer would be right to criticise the commentary contained in the report because it is indeed out of date. That is because more recent economic indicators suggest that we are heading for a major recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        The OECD's forecast for the stabilisation of our external debt is based on continued job growth and only moderate falls in private investment. Now we find from one of the more reliable indicators, the ANZ Bank job advertisement series, that this month's index is down a massive 40 per cent on this time last year. This suggests major falls in employment levels over the next 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is probably even more interesting is the OECD survey's brave predictions of a reduction in the current account deficit, as well as a recovery in domestic demand in 1991 and reductions in the rate of our inflation. I say `brave' because every survey since 1985 has consistently overestimated Australia's future economic performance on the basis of these key indicators.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us go back and look at the prophesies of the OECD for the Australian economy over the past five years. In its survey 1985, it gave us this prediction:
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent fall in the Australian dollar, if maintained, should lead to a positive contribution from the foreign balance, particularly in 1986, and to some narrowing of the current account deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was in 1985. We all know what happened in 1986. Needless to say, in the 1986-87 survey, the OECD was forced to eat those words, noting that, `contrary to expectations, imbalances that were emerging at the time have become distinctly worse'. That is a slight understatement. Yet this did not stop the same OECD in its 1986-87 survey going on to predict `some reduction in the external deficit and moderation of inflation'. This prediction also proved to be way off the mark.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then in the 1988 survey we were told to expect `some additional decline in the current account deficit as a share of GDP'. Instead, that share climbed to 6 per cent of gross domestic product.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latest 1989-90 survey now tells us that `the current account deteriorated anew and inflationary pressures increased'. Indeed that is true. With the benefit of hindsight, who could argue with it? We ask why the OECD has been consistently wrong in its estimates of the future performance of the Australian economy. Why should we take its latest prediction of a soft landing for the Australian economy with anything other than a grain of salt?
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer is that the OECD's commentaries have been based on optimistic assumptions about Government economic policies. Its predictions have been predicated on calls for greater structural reform, anti-inflationary policies and fiscal restraint. In other words, major policy changes have been required to give effect to the OECD's forecasts; they are changes which we all know have not been forthcoming from this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This fact is all the more damming because the OECD economic survey is largely a reflection of the Treasury line. Thus, while the Treasurer was telling us during the election that all the tough decisions had been made and the economy was set for non-inflationary growth and a reduction in the current account deficit, the OECD had already finalised its report based on Treasury information, which argues that these things can be achieved only with a major effort on the part of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The failed predictions of the OECD with respect to the Australian economy are thus a catalogue of the policy failures of this Government. The OECD and, by implication, the Australian Treasury, know what needs to be done and I suggest they get on and do it.

         â€”In the weeks leading up to the last Federal election and to a lesser extent since that time, there has been considerable unrest among service station proprietors and the motoring public, particularly in north Queensland, about the escalating price of petrol. Not only has the rapid price increase for petrol impacted on the national economy, but for tens of thousands of people living in rural areas and provincial cities of Australia it has caused significant hardship.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is the firm belief of many people involved in the petrol retail industry that the cause of the trouble was the introduction of what is commonly known as `rack pricing'. The Prices Surveillance Authority has described rack pricing as the price charged by a refiner to all resellers who purchase and collect petrol at the refinery on a cash on delivery basis; that is, the purchaser collects the product at the refinery rack. It is believed that rack pricing was first introduced by Shell and later by each of the other oil companies. Indeed, the introduction of rack pricing by the oil companies was encouraged by the service station associations.

        Rack pricing has backfired to the detriment of service station proprietors, many of whom have lost their discount benefits. It has also backfired on the motoring public and the industry, who are currently paying the highest price ever for petrol products. When rack pricing was first introduced it applied only to petrol, but it has now been applied to a wide range of transport fuels, including diesel. People living in inland Australia face the additional burden of high freight costs. To its credit the Trade Practices Commission opposed the concept of rack pricing from the outset and as early as 1988 predicted that the policy of rack pricing would be a failure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suspect that the Shell oil company, which is a foreign owned multinational company whose main motivation is self-interest, introduced rack pricing without dealing with the concerns expressed by the 1988 report on the petrol industry by the Trade Practices Commission. Many service station proprietors thought that the introduction of rack pricing would provide stability in the volatile petrol retail industry. This has turned out to be an unrealistic expectation in a market oversupplied with retail outlets. The oil companies quickly recognised that rack pricing would eliminate the price erosion they experienced in their wholesale price, which had previously prevailed in a far more competitive market.
       </para>
       <para>
        One practical effect of the introduction of rack pricing was that oil companies were able for the first time to secure the full wholesale petrol price, which constituted for them a gain of more than 2c a litre. The 2c or more a litre gain for the oil companies was calculated because the current market structure does not allow the price reduction that existed previously. Prior to rack pricing all companies gave rebates to their franchise dealers when price cutting occurred. The present rack pricing system has meant that the oil companies have not had to provide these rebates because discounting does not occur. This vast windfall for the oil companies has constituted an unjustifiable impost on the community and, indeed, the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        To add insult to injury, the Prices Surveillance Authority changed the basis of the wholesale price from a price which could be justified to a so-called intervention price, based on the benchmark price of the cost of fuel imported from Singapore. The intervention price is easily calculated by the oil companies which can then maximise the price they charge to the outlets.
       </para>
       <para>
        From all this, one hears frequent and bitter complaints from people associated with the industry against rack pricing. Surely only the gullible would believe that in circumstances such as this the oil companies would forsake self-interest and compete in the wholesale market. The regime in force is somewhat akin to putting a guard dog in a butcher's shop.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its report, the Prices Surveillance Authority highlighted the high fuel costs in north Queensland and indicated it would visit Cairns and Townsville to investigate the collapse of petrol retail practices developed by the Prices Surveillance Authority. After being advised that the Authority proposed to visit the area, I advised the local media and other interested parties of the impending visit, only to find time after time that the Prices Surveillance Authority prefers to operate from the rarefied air of its Melbourne skyscraper in blissful ignorance of the burden it has imposed on the people of northern Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not content with the windfall profits derived from rack pricing and ineffective price surveillance, the oil companies are continuing to extract more revenue from their lessees and commission agents through facility based rentals and franchise fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Petrol is an essential commodity and because of its importance every efficiency must be exploited in delivering reasonably priced fuel to the public. This efficiency is normally achieved by vigorous competition, by market forces. I do not need to enter into a detailed debate on economics, but the inescapable fact in the petroleum industry is that the present marketing arrangements have failed. The oil companies do not compete; they are not forced to compete.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission is aware of this but, whilst it has considerable statutory powers to maintain competitive forces in a market, it has no legal mechanism by which it can ensure fair competition when the market fails. Townsville recently played a significant role in bringing about a price reduction after it became apparent that the service station proprietors had not passed on a reduction in the wholesale price as a result of the currency movement.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Parliament has a duty in circumstances such as this to provide the Trade Practices Commission with the legislative authority to deal with market failure as has been provided in some other countries, for example, the United States. Market failure may occur when demand collapses, and there is a need for a time to allow the formation of supervised crises cartels to allow for recovery. I give the House two instances of what can happen when the market structure fails. In the first instance, an industry group is formed to create agreements to resolve market problems which under normal circumstances would be classed as anti-competitive practices. This cartel conducts its recovery under the supervision of the Government, for example, a statutory body established for that purpose. In the second instance, market failure may also occur, as has happened here, when supply is in the hands of a self-interested few who see no need to compete. As it stands, the oil companies are becoming richer, the retailers are becoming frustrated, misdirected, manipulated and unprofitable, and the consumer is paying more than ever before.
       </para>
       <para>
        In their frustration, the service station proprietors have begun what they call `a public awareness campaign'. The real issue for many retail outlets is that they are not making an adequate living. The Motor Traders Association of Queensland has commissioned a study by the University of Queensland. In a preliminary report, it found that the typical average service station needs a margin of around 15 per cent to break even and around 21 per cent if it is to achieve similar profitability to other small businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst it seems obvious enough to the service station proprietors that they must substantially increase their prices, it is less obvious to the consumers who must pay for the continued existence of the proliferation of service stations.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are around 7,000 service stations in Australia, most of which sell an average of one million litres of petrol a year. To ensure the profitability sought by the industry, the public, the consumer, will be asked to find between $350m and $560m. Such imposts are unacceptable to any government. The industry knows this and that is why it directs its campaign against the present levels of tax but, without stopping to think whether it would be directly or through changes in the tax regime, it is still asking the public to pay, through increased prices, at least $350m, to ensure that they achieve a level of income to which they would like to become accustomed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The oil companies, the representative associations and even most service stations, agree that there are two many sites. There has been some reduction, but the change is too slow. It is time for the Government to intervene in this failed market for the public benefit. The cost of intervention is slight by comparison with the alternative of doing nothing. I would be surprised if a petroleum marketing authority could not be established for a small sum of money, maybe $2m to $3m a year. It would face a restructuring task, drawing on the expertise of the Prices Surveillance Authority, the Trade Practices Commission, consumer affairs bodies, the Australian Taxation Office and so forth to develop and administer a revenue neutral scheme to accelerate change in the industry and to initiate competition in a failed petroleum market which presently does such a disservice to the Australian economy.

         â€”I wish to grieve now on behalf of the Australian wool industry because the Government has seen fit to have only two hours of debate later in the afternoon about the major problems facing the wool industry. I declare my interest as a woolgrower, which was my previous occupation before entering the Parliament. The problems facing the wool industry go back to the arguments in the 1960s, led by Sir William Gunn, when he put forward the proposition that a reserve price scheme be implemented to ensure that there was a floor in the market at a low level for all Australian woolgrowers. The alternative argument was that a reserve price should become the price that woolgrowers received, come hell or high water. That is the argument today amongst woolgrowers, wool processors and manufacturers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The background to the reserve price scheme is that it was introduced in 1971 at a low point in the industry when wool was worth 36c a pound. It was not dangerous at that time, because of the low level and state of the industry. It was suggested that it would provide a stable price for a range of fibres and the key element of the argument at that time was that the purchaser would know that his competitor would not get these fibres at a lower price than he purchased them at.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been two occasions when the stockpile of wool has been fairly high-1.6 million bales in 1974-75 and 1.6 million bales in 1983-84. On both occasions when the industry became disturbed, the stockpiles were cleared steadily in a rising market, with a real price that was 66 per cent less than the price in 1990. This gave the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia, made up of woolgrowers, and the growers themselves around Australia a false optimism that the reserve price scheme could in fact maintain and set a price, and that would work along the lines of a consumer price index approach to setting a world commodity price in wool, something like the controlled wage fixing system that we have in Australia. There was no regard in the attitudes and arguments to the fundamental laws of supply and demand that so afflict the problem that we are facing in 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the supply side, because of the existence of the reserve price scheme, woolgrowers were encouraged to increase their sheep flocks. In 1983 there were 130 million sheep in Australia and in 1990 there are 173 million sheep. We have had a run of good seasons; we have had better wool cuts per head; and we have had an increase in production, because a number of new producers have been encouraged to move into the industry due to the floor price security.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the demand side, we have had the factor of a high price, which has caused considerable problems in past months. China has pulled out of the market, which has made a major difference in the auction system. In recent months the USSR has been unable to find the hard currency to pay for its wool purchases. Exchange rate fluctuations have also added to a falling away of demand, not to mention a slowing of the world economy in some of the developed nations. This has all led to concerns about the state of the wool industry. Because the reserve price mechanism was in place, there was a reluctance for woolgrowers and wool leaders to enter into any meaningful debate about this rapid escalation in price and the changes that had been going on in the wool industry over the past couple of years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the attention of the House to a quote from a report prepared by Acil Australia Pty Ltd to the Australian Council of Wool Exporters, dated January 1990. This summarises the position clearly and precisely:
       </para>
       <para>
        Between 1986/87 and 1988/89 the minimum reserve price for Australian wool was increased by 71 per cent-from 508 cents per kilogram clean to 870 cents. Over the previous six years it had risen by just 39 per cent. While the increase reflected strong overseas demand at the time and the fact that, due to devaluation of the Australian dollar, wool had become relatively cheap in terms of user currencies, the move was a potentially dangerous one for two reasons: first, it made the industry vulnerable to any subsequent downturn in demand; and second, it unleashed a strong incentive for wool growers to increase sheep numbers and wool production.
       </para>
       <para>
        These dangers were real because, since the reserve price scheme commenced in the early 1970s, the wool industry at all levels had accepted as an article of faith that under no circumstances would the reserve price level ever be reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987 and 1988 these concerns were voiced by a few but not heard-and certainly not heeded-by the majority.
       </para>
       <para>
        I re-emphasise that quite dramatic change. In two seasons the price went up by 71 per cent, compared to the previous six years, when there was a 39 per cent increase. That was an obvious danger sign to the wool industry. Any steep increase in the base commodity price-if we compare the coal industry, wheat industry, iron ore, rubber or silver-immediately signals danger to the producers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I seek the indulgence of the House to incorporate in Hansard a graph which clearly demonstrates the movement of the wool price.

       <para>
        I would like to draw the attention of the House also to a quote from Mr Julian Cribb, which summarises my argument, when he wrote in the Australian on 28 May 1988:
       </para>
       <para>
        Six weeks ago the New South Wales Farmers' Association handed the wool industry a loaded gun. The next month will reveal whether the industry uses it to blow its brains out. Within that time the AWC and the WCA must take what is potentially the most momentous decision in the history of the modern wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        That decision is whether to set the floor price for wool at a level higher than the real price of wool for most of the 20th century.
       </para>
       <para>
        If they get it wrong, not only could it spell the destruction of the wool marketing scheme and the future of thousands of wool growers, but it will also cause a blow-out in the trade deficit and impose huge costs upon the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Economic history shows that no price support or buffer stock scheme has yet survived more than a decade or so, for example, the collapse of the New Zealand scheme for wool in the 1960s, the international tin price in 1986, a Brazilian coffee scheme in the 1930s, the failure of OPEC to maintain high oil prices-and even the failure of the Australian trade union movement to maintain full wage indexation.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the reasons so many price support schemes fail is that the industry concerned becomes too greedy. Fixing prices too high has three major impacts:
       </para>
       <para>
        discouraging customers, so reducing demand and creating surpluses;
       </para>
       <para>
        encouraging the production of alternative competing commodities; and
       </para>
       <para>
        encouraging other non-producers to go into production.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wool industry's dilemma is that it has already largely committed itself to using the floor price-essentially a disaster prevention mechanism-as a device to ratchet up and lock in its returns. In other words, it is no longer a floor price, but has become instead a form of intervention price.
       </para>
       <para>
        He quite clearly states the case that the problems we see in the wool industry today are a reflection of the greed of industry leaders who did not read the market signals at that time. The position now is that we have a reserve price of 870c and the possibility of a 20 per cent wool tax, and the potential of these positions is a peak debt of $4 billion in 1993 with a surplus of six million bales.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wool industry next week will have to resolve whether it will bite the bullet on the reserve price scheme back to 700c or a lower figure. It is my hunch that the reserve price would probably be nearer 600c if the wool industry is to clearly face the market situation and clear away that huge stockpile and not bring about a situation where the Wool Corporation, Australian woolgrowers and the nation itself will get into such heavy debt that the wool industry will never recover.

         â€”The 1990s have begun with fresh hope for developing countries. The United Nations Special Session on International Economic Cooperation has agreed on a declaration outlining a new development strategy for the 1990s. The special session was proposed by the G77 developing countries, principally to deal with the debts of the Third World. Those debts, which total over $1,700 billion, are the principal cause of the net outflow of funds from developing to industrialised countries.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Between 1984 and 1989 there was a net transfer of funds from developing debtor countries to industrialised creditor countries totalling $240 billion. That net payment from the poor to the rich prevents the investment within developing countries which is essential for renewed development.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1980s were a lost decade for development. During the last decade many parts of the developing world experienced a depression more severe than the Great Depression in industrialised countries in the 1930s. For example, average real income of the highly indebted countries is about 10 per cent lower now than in 1980 and a third lower than it would have been had the 1965 to 1980 growth trend continued through the 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nearly a billion people live in absolute poverty. The gap between industrialised and developing countries has continued to widen. The policies of governments of both Western and developing countries have contributed to this increase in poverty. Ministers and ambassadors who spoke at the special session generally recognised this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The meeting was held in the last week of April and the early days of May in the United Nations in New York. Given the difficulty of reaching agreement amongst the 160 member governments, the final declaration is a considerable achievement. The Assembly President, Mr Joseph Garba of Nigeria, called the declaration `a watershed in the history of international economic cooperation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the declaration, the governments accept a shared responsibility for global injustice. Each country must accept responsibility for the well-being of its own citizens, while recognising that its policies also affect other countries. Western countries recognise that global economic conditions have been extremely unfavourable for developing countries during the 1980s. To break this impasse, comprehensive national action and international support measures are required. The declaration stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Finding an early and durable solution to the international debt problems, meeting the increasing needs for development finance, creating an open and equitable trading system and facilitating diversification and modernisation of the economies of developing countries, particularly those that are commodity dependent, are conditions for the revitalisation of growth and development in the developing countries in the 1990s, requiring continued concerted efforts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Acceptance of this challenge leads naturally to broad policy recommendations. As the industrialised countries dominate the global economy, it is essential that they coordinate their macro-economic policies, which should take full account of the interests and concerns of all countries, including developing countries. The declaration emphasises that `efforts should be made to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral surveillance aimed at re- ducing existing external and fiscal im- balances, promoting non-inflationary sustainable growth, lowering real rates of interest, and making exchange rates more stable and markets more accessible'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In return, `developing countries should continue to work towards keeping control over inflationary tendencies, promoting domestic savings, achieving favourable conditions for domestic and foreign investment, modernising the economies and increasing their international competitiveness'.
       </para>
       <para>
        A primary objective of developing countries must be the human development of their people, which includes maximising attention to health, nutrition, housing, population policies and other social services. There was considerable dispute during this special session about policies for reducing debt. The declaration represents a compromise which it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent initiatives and measures to reduce the stock and service of debt or to provide debt relief for developing countries should be broadly implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        That very general statement is clearly inadequate as a debt relief strategy. Most developing countries and some industrialised countries recognise that the present Brady plan has been ineffective, as so far only five of the 70-plus problem debtors have received benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The special session did not generate a breakthrough on debt, but it was the judgment of all participants that the most important outcome of the conference would be a unanimous declaration providing a firm foundation for future negotiation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The declaration calls on all developed countries to implement their commitment to the international target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for official development assistance. That is a challenge for Australia, as our aid is now only 0.33 per cent of our GNP, which is less than half of the target that we continue to endorse.
       </para>
       <para>
        The role of science and technology in upgrading economic dynamism is recognised in the communique, as is the role that research can play in finding ways of protecting the environment. The communique acknowledges that industrialised countries must accept the main responsibility for reducing pollution and also that new and additional financial resources will have to be channelled to developing countries to enable them to protect their own environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many speakers at the special session mentioned the peace dividend which the end of the Cold War should allow. The communique calls on all countries-West, East and South-to reduce expenditures for military purposes, so opening up the possibility of enhanced spending on social and economic development.
       </para>
       <para>
        The declaration calls for the liberalisation of the global trading system. This is a goal to which Australia provides leadership, both through our role in the Cairns Group in advocating reduced agricultural protection, and through the reductions in our own protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        Agreement on a generalised communique is a modest achievement, but it is significant because 160 governments were involved. If all countries implemented the policies described, global injustice would be considerably reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are also other sources for hope. The special session was the first of a series of conferences, each of which, to be successful, will have to build on the achievements of those before it. During the next three years there will be five global conferences on development: the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries; the preparation of a new international development strategy at the General Assembly later this year; the World Summit for Children in September; the Eighth Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1991; and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        Intellectual leadership this year is likely to come from the United Nations Development Program human development report which will be published on 24 May. This report is about people and how development enlarges their choices. The report outlines a new development index reflecting life expectancy, literacy and command over the resources to enjoy a decent standard of living. This is a more comprehensive index than the usual comparison of income per head.
       </para>
       <para>
        To achieve implementation of such goals and policies requires strength and political will. Concurrently with the special session, Parliamentarians for Global Action organised a workshop for politicians. The communique from that workshop is considerably more ambitious than the declaration from the special session. For example, we call for all governments to reduce their military expenditure to a maximum of 2 per cent of gross domestic product. We also call for a reduction of both commercial and official developing country debt by 50 per cent. The establishment of a global debt management facility would assist in achieving that goal.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I flew back to Australia from the special session, I read forecasts prepared by the United Nations for the next decade on the assumption of unchanged policy. Those forecasts conclude that, without policy changes, income per head in sub-Saharan Africa will continue to decline and in Latin America and western Asia will grow only very slowly. The poor will become poorer unless governments act decisively, and that requires electors to urge them to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can be encouraged by the fresh start made at the special session, but not one inch will be gained unless our Government and every other government change their policies in the ways proposed. Political action is essential.

         â€”A very disturbing trend has emerged over recent years in the provision of State and Federal government services. Sadly, it is true to say that country people have suffered a disproportionate share of the burden in the general reduction or abolition of government services. Nowhere is this more starkly revealed than in the area of health services.

        Conclusively, the Federal and Victorian Labor governments have minimal interests in Australians living outside the major metropolitan centres. Worse still, the more remote or relatively isolated a community, the more disadvantaged they become. It is no exaggeration to say that there has been a complete abdication of the responsibility that Federal and State governments have to these Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Decisions regarding the allocation of government services are invariably made on the basis of population, rather than the need of communities, however small in number. It is a cruel and callous hoax for these governments to make play of the catchcry of social justice. The catchcry of social justice has a very hollow ring to most country people.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the area of provision of health services in Victoria there are particularly startling problems. Country hospitals, particularly small public hospitals, have found it impossible to operate under the budgeting processes imposed by the Cain Government. A classic example of a true community hospital dying a death of a thousand cuts is the Shelley Memorial Hospital at Bunyip, situated in my neighbouring electorate. I know that the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) has worked very hard to assist the Shelley Memorial Hospital. Regrettably, the State Government continually turns a blind eye to the whole problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        As concerned as I am about country public hospitals, I wish today to draw the attention of the House specifically to the issue of bush nursing hospitals. Bush nursing hospitals are a unique Victorian feature. They are not public hospitals but are owned by the community and are non-profit organisations. Consequently, they depend on privately insured patients. Naturally, with the introduction of the compulsory Medicare levy, the number of privately insured residents in the communities has dramatically declined. I urge the House not to make the same mistake as the Federal Government, which regards bush nursing hospitals in the same light as private hospitals operated for profit.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is vitally important to remember always that many of Victoria's 35 bush nursing hospitals are situated in remote areas of Victoria, especially in parts of the Mallee and Wimmera. Therefore, local residents have no choice but to rely on the bush nursing hospitals, as the nearest regional public hospitals are often a very considerable distance away.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one knows this better than my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), who has worked tirelessly since the introduction of Medicare in early 1984 to save the bush nursing hospitals in his electorate. His efforts on behalf of the endangered Beulah bush nursing hospital have been relentless and are an example to all honourable members of how to vigorously discharge their responsibilities to their constituents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those of us who represent bush nursing hospitals have been greatly assisted recently by the determined campaign by journalist and feature writer Glenda Banks in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial newspaper. Several columns highlighting the parlous financial plight of bush nursing hospitals and the consequential effect on local communities have been written by Glenda Banks. Her publicising of the issue has given a great deal of encouragement to otherwise despondent staff and supporters of bush nursing hospitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, new public pressure has been placed on Federal and State Ministers of health to respond to the funding problems, pushing almost all bush nursing hospitals to the point of closure. Of the 35 bush nursing hospitals in Victoria, 15 have estimated that they will close within five years, some even within 12 months. The Korong bush nursing hospital at Wedderburn closed on 30 March this year, and Murrayville hospital, west of Ouyen, is expected to close on 30 June 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        In smaller towns, where the aged are in need of care, most hospitals need help to expand their role to respond to the changes in their communities. However, it is important that each hospital be assessed on its individual needs and assisted accordingly. I do not believe that there is a universal prescription which can be applied across the board which will assist all bush nursing hospitals; rather, they must be assessed individually according to the specific needs of their local communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        This could be, firstly, a mix of acute beds and/or nursing home beds and/or hostel beds, plus community nurse and outpatients; secondly, flexibility of staffing to provide the services required; thirdly, adequate capital funding to assist with the conversion to provide the approved services; fourthly, adequate ongoing funding to assist with recurrent costs. This may need to be slightly more than is at present allowed for in the Commonwealth criteria for nursing homes or hostel services, particularly if the number of beds allowed is fewer than 30. In summary, a small rural hospital may be quite adequately served with two to five acute beds, eight to 20 nursing home beds and/or 10 to 20 hostel beds with community nurse and outpatients.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has made much play of the fact that multipurpose centre funding has been introduced by the Commonwealth to assist in rural areas, but this system has very restrictive guidelines. The Commonwealth multipurpose funding of $6.3m is provided for four years, commencing in the 1989-90 financial year, for the whole of Australia, but only three Victorian bush nursing hospitals received funding in the first round. The aim of the multipurpose funding is to supplement the mainstream funding of the other services.
       </para>
       <para>
        While there do not appear to be too many complaints with the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, there appears to be a hold-up with the State Government, which now apparently has to approve all concepts and plans for nursing homes and hostels, even after the Department of Community Services and Health has given approval, and, inevitably, this is where the hiatus occurs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question could be asked of the Victorian State Government: if it is not providing funds for nursing homes and/or hostels for bush nursing hospitals, either for capital works or recurrent funding, why does it have the power of veto over any approvals that might be given by the Commonwealth?
       </para>
       <para>
        Country people pay Medicare levies, too. When the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) was the Minister for Community Services and Health, he stated quite clearly that under the Commonwealth charter there was no reason why Medicare funds could not be used towards acute bed funding in bush nursing hospitals. So far, all efforts to obtain any assistance in this area from the State Government have been fruitless. In the rural communities, while the population is not great, the needs of these people are just as real.
       </para>
       <para>
        Salvation for bush nursing is realistic multipurpose centre guidelines, recognition of the vital role that bush nursing plays in the community, and flexible, committed support and cooperation from government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been staggered over the years, as have my honourable colleagues, by the inertia within the bureaucracy and State and Federal governments in addressing the problems of bush nursing hospitals without attempting to resolve them. It seems that they comprise the forgotten component of the health system. Tragically, I have to say that there has been a washing of the collective hands of State and Federal governments for several years. If the political will is apparent, the problems can be overcome. Nothing in the bush nursing hospital sector defies solution. It is simply a matter of the Government finally addressing the problems of the funding crisis now threatening the bush nursing hospitals and, most sadly, the local communities they serve so very well.

It is easy for them to say that more government funds should be found for their electorates, but day after day I have sat in this chamber and heard the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Mallee and other Opposition members say that too much money is spent by governments; that taxes should be lowered and less should be spent in all areas. So I find it contradictory that those honourable members are able to say that more money should be spent, although on worthy causes, such as the bush hospitals.

Honourable members might recall that I made a series of allegations about Dr Page's activities in November and December last year. I had intended to advise the House of some new developments, until this morning, when some information was drawn to my attention. Apparently Dr Page is appearing in court today in Wagga Wagga, after being charged on 12 counts of fraud involving a total of $722,000. As that matter is now before the courts and is sub judice, I will not give the speech that I intended to give today on those matters. Like any person charged, Dr Page has the right to be considered innocent until the matter goes before the court and is dealt with in the appropriate manner.

        Today I wish to read to the House one of the most interesting letters that I have ever received as a member of parliament. It is a report written by a young gentleman called Richard Fernance. I met Richard at Camp Breakaway, which is a camp established to provide a holiday or a break for people who suffer severe physical disabilities. Richard has such severe physical disability that he has to be fed, usually by his parents, or by the people who look after him in his home, or when he is at Camp Breakaway, by the volunteer helpers who assist people during their period at Camp Breakaway.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has some mobility, because he is able to drive an electric wheelchair. This report was prepared by Richard with a pencil on a computer terminal, typing one letter at a time. I would like to read to the House some of Richard's comments about his time at Camp Breakaway:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Breakaway Lodge is a dream that became a reality this week (14th-21st October, 1989). It has been a vision for everyone who has been connected with Camp Breakaway in the past. On behalf of everyone, I would like to try to highlight what the spirit and reality of Camp Breakaway is all about!
       </para>
       <para>
        Camp Breakaway started 7 years ago in 1982 with its Inaugural Camp being held at the Camp Toukley site in the township of Toukley on the Central Coast of NSW. This Breakaway Camp came into being through the support of the Rotary Club of Wyong. I was fortunate enough to be among the 30 Campers who had disabilities to witness this first Breakaway. That's why I have chosen this title, the ``Breakaway Report''.
       </para>
       <para>
        At Camp Breakaway's first camp it was the beginning of something of a total breakaway. Its primary function was and still is to provide young people with disabilities a holiday as campers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Camp Breakaway has proven to be a training ground for both people with and without disabilities in that it allows young people with disabilities to take control over their own care as far as possible. This is so because the Campers (young people with disabilities) tell their respective Helpers what they can and cannot physically do. This means that the Campers receive the help that they require. Camp Breakaway also has Voluntary Trained Nurses to advise Campers and their respective Helpers on any medical issues that may arise while staying at the camp. This is done in a manner with a minimum of fuss. As a person with a disability, I don't feel we are treated in patronising ways. This is a real breakaway (change) for some of the Campers who live in Nursing Homes where these patronising attitudes can be rampant!!
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the best aspects of Camp Breakaway is the method of using voluntary Helpers who don't often have any prior contact with people with disabilities. Sometimes some of these Helpers are unemployed at the time of these camps. One of these Helpers that I met at Camp Breakaway felt so close to the people with disabilities that he later went on to work at a disability organisation that I also used to work at. While being at Camp Breakaway some past values (barriers) of both Helpers and Campers are broken away. This Helper (mentioned above) and I had deep and meaningful conversations about both our past life experiences. His life was of travelling around Australia, while my life was of living with my family and going to a Special School for the disabled. This Helper and I learnt a lot about each other's different past backgrounds. Before Camp Breakaway I don't feel that we, as two individuals, had ever contemplated each others different life experiences. Later I was to find out that this particular Helper had nearly walked out on the first day of this camp. This was because he had never previously had any contact with people with disabilities and felt that he couldn't cope with the camp's situation. As I have already mentioned above this person and I went on to be workmates at a disability organisation soon after this Camp. I call us ``workmates'' because when we, the people with disabilities worked with this person at this organisation, that's what we all were, equal workmates. Similar experiences like this for other Campers and Helpers at Camp Breakaway are good in that they make us equal in our attitude towards each other. Contact like this is always a highlight of `Breakaway' because I feel through the physical help that voluntary Helpers provide, everyone benefits. These benefits are as a result of the Campers and Helpers mixing in a real life holiday situation for a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        I feel one of the greatest breaks that came out of this first camp was the fact that it provided a holiday community, where young people with disabilities were and still can have a rage of a holiday with dignity. This is the kind of help that I feel people with disabilities don't mind receiving from a Community Club such as Rotary. This Club could have easily given disability organisations monetary funding to help the ``poor'' disabled in other ways, but they chose not to. The Camp Breakaway function was to be a lot more than this.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that first Inaugural Camp, three weeks preceding it, the Wyong Rotary Club had to run newspaper advertisements to find enough young people with disabilities to participate in it. I remember having conversations with local Wyong Rotarians about some opposition from some people within disability organisations who were concerned that Camp Breakaway wasn't specialised to handle and care for people with disabilities. Both of these issues weren't problems for later camps. In fact later camps have become so popular that Camp Breakaway has had to turn away many prospective Campers. This is one of the reasons why Breakaway Lodge was built.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have time to read all the comments, but I would like to read one more paragraph:
       </para>
       <para>
        As a Camper of Camp Breakaway I was amazed to come back to the new Breakaway Lodge site, this last week. It amazed me to find that the general spirit of the camp hadn't changed to all from the first camp, seven years ago. Reflecting over the past week it has made me realise what the Camp Breakaway Committee and its strong supporters have tried to achieve. They have made this Breakaway Lodge site at San Remo, somewhere we, the Campers can go to have a good holiday break, thus gaining independence from the institutions or our families in which we live with. This also gives a well earned break for the parents or care providers of the Campers. This is another reason why Camp Breakaway was set up and needs to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply emphasise the views of Richard Fernance, someone with a very severe disability, who found the work at Camp Breakaway and the work that is now being carried out at the new site at San Remo to be very productive, not only for himself but also for the voluntary helpers who gave up some of their time to help people with disabilities to have a break from their families.
       </para>
       <para>
        Richard is currently studying accountancy at one of the tertiary institutions in Sydney.

I thank the House.

Other aspects are looking after the family and looking after the elderly, the sick and the disabled, as the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said a few minutes ago. Those things engulf everything. A politician who tries to look after those things is a true environmentalist, not the greens, who are single issue people, as I have said in the House on many occasions.

        As we enter the 1990s, the greatest stain on our civilisation is the fact that 250,000 children are dying each week from diseases which can be prevented.

        UNICEF states that protecting the mental and physical well-being of the 1 3/4 billion children who will be born in the 1990s is fundamental to the world's economic prosperity, political stability and environmental integrity. However, money alone cannot solve that problem. It requires a public and political commitment at the highest levels to take on the challenges and see them through. That is why UNICEF has proposed the first ever World Summit for Children, at which presidents and prime ministers from around the world will examine the extraordinary opportunities now available for protecting and enhancing the lives of children.

        In response to the speech of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), this amount would have adequately funded bush nursing hospitals in my electorate for 12 months and would have given isolated people a measure of social equity. He is obviously unaware that these hospitals are not asking for additional funds; they are simply asking for some funds. They get not one cent at present. They are community hospitals and deserve the same support that the community and public hospitals throughout Australia presently get.

         â€”The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and I have recently received representations from pharmacists in our electorates who have told us that there is a very great shortage of influenza vaccine. We immediately contacted the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who told us that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories produces the vaccine from May to November, and this year it produced about 200,000 more doses than it would have normally produced. Unfortunately, this shortage may have been caused by media reports of flu strains that are entering Australia, and there has been a bit of a panic about the situation. The reason that Commonwealth Serum Laboratories produces that vaccine from May to November is that the viruses tend to change each season.

        The Minister's response was that the vaccine should be saved for those people at risk, meaning the elderly, invalids and those who are susceptible to the flu, but this situation is very hard to police. There is a very real shortage of this vaccine. One pharmacist in my electorate told me that he gets five or 10 vaccine doses a week, but he needs up to 100. I would ask the Government to look at the situation because, if there is a very real shortage of the vaccine in the electorates of Lyne, Riverina-Darling and Mallee, there is certainly a shortage throughout Australia.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) tells us that, on present trends, 100 million of those children will die. Fifty million deaths could be prevented through the use of simple technology against the three biggest killers: measles, which can be cured by vaccination; dehydration, which can be prevented with oral rehydration therapy, commonly known as ORT; and pneumonia, with the use of antibiotics.

        Over two million lives were saved last year through immunisation against measles, tetanus and whooping cough, at a cost of some $1.50 per child. One million children were saved through the use of oral rehydration therapy to prevent dehydration, at the cost of 12c a day. I should explain oral rehydration therapy to the House, as it was barely known outside scientific circles in the early 1980s. It is a simple solution of salt and sugar to prevent dehydration which saves one million lives of children aged under five each year.

        There were, of course, other major achievements during the 1980s through UNICEF. Immunisation coverage increased from less than 10 per cent of the developing world's children being immunised in 1980 to 70 per cent now. Immunisation is on target for 80 per cent by the end of this year. This is now saving approximately two million young lives per year.

       </para>
       <para>
        I said, in regard to those who are in employment in this period ahead, that as far as one can see looking at those elements that because of a combination of the projected increases in wages that will occur, the tax cuts that will take place at the beginning of next year and the projected movement in prices for those people it does appear that there will be some marginal real improvement in living standards. The standards of those who are dependent upon welfare payments-to the extent that those are, as they overwhelmingly are, indexed-should be maintained.

       <para>
        I also in that press conference made it quite clear that as far as Australians were concerned they ought to understand, as we do, that we are not looking towards easy economic circumstances in the future and that it will be incumbent upon the Government as we approach this period of Budget formation to continue the fiscal tightness that has characterised our conduct of the affairs of this country over the last few years. That tightness has been reflected most particularly, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, over four successive years in real reductions in Commonwealth outlays, in moving to surplus and turning the public sector borrowing requirement into a public sector debt repayment situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of those things have been achieved easily, and what I wanted to make clear to the Australian people yesterday during my press conference was that we would adhere to those decisions that we had already taken in the area of wages and in regard to taxes and, on the basis of the assumption about price movements, that that should be what happens to living standards for those in employment, but I said that we would be making some tough decisions in the period leading up to the Budget. That I regard as an accurate and appropriate statement of the situation.

       <para>
        Basically, the proposition from the honourable member for Bennelong is that we should not just be calling upon employers to spend more on training, but should in fact introduce a new tax and tax everyone. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . if the Government really wants to put more money into training, it ought to have the guts to tax everybody.

        He is not content with our proposal, which in any event is not a tax but only a requirement that employers should spend one per cent, and later 1 3/4 per cent, of their payroll on training. It is not a tax, and indeed the measure will be successful when we raise nothing at all-indeed, when employers themselves are deciding the best way to spend their training dollars.

        Once again, Opposition members are demonstrating, as they did yesterday, that they have a kind of frenzy about taxation and want to impose a training tax on everyone.

        Everybody benefits from training. If people go into a restaurant and do not get the soup spilt on them, they benefit. If those people are consumers who do not get soup spilt on them, they do not pay anything towards the cost of training that waiter. That is my very point.

         â€”Later in the speech-in a slightly more coherent part of the speech-he asked me to respond to his suggestion that there ought to be a delay in relation to the start-up date of this measure. That is what I am doing, Mr Speaker: I am doing a service to the honourable member for Bennelong. This is a quite extraordinary backflip as far as the Opposition is concerned. At the time of the election, in order to justify a reduction of $250m of expenditure on training and training related programs, members of the Opposition said in their policy:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Liberal and National Parties' policies strongly support industry efforts to upgrade workers' skills by providing training and retraining courses, but believe it is more appropriate for employers to accept the financial responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, nothing from a Liberal Party government. But just last night we were told that we should not muck around with something which in fact requires employers to spend just a more on their own training, but rather we should introduce a new tax and tax everyone. The Government, of course, does not support that proposition. Our measure will involve those employers whose payroll exceeds $200,000. It will pick up something like 75 per cent of the work force. I am quite sure it will make a contribution to lifting the level of skills in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most extraordinary comment that the honourable member for Bennelong made was that we should delay the introduction of this measure. He said that we were not giving employers sufficient time to respond to this. The point is that we have been debating this issue for two years. We revealed the Bill before the election, and yet the Opposition says, `No, not enough time'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very interesting to put that against the honourable member's claims about what should happen with the work force and what should happen in relation to micro-economic change generally. He is caterwauling constantly about the need for an acceleration of micro-economic change. Indeed, only last week he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No micro-economic challenge is more important than that in relation to industrial relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        But when it comes to the point of putting the acid on employers, putting the acid on industry and asking them to make a response and asking them to improve their performance, of course, the honourable member for Bennelong and his colleagues say, `It is too fast-slow down'.

The theme of that is that we demand the best standards possible, and our electorate expects us to maintain that.

         â€”The Government's intention clearly is to stand by its election pledge not to introduce a consumption tax. I note a statement by the shadow Treasurer yesterday indicating that in 1985 the Government itself was intending to introduce a consumption tax without compensating future savings. Opposition members should pay very close attention to what the shadow Treasurer is saying and the path he is leading them down. Yesterday, he issued the following statement:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Treasurer's methodology for calculating the cost of a consumption tax compensation package, as outlined by him at question time today, is completely wrong and his own 1985 White Paper tells us why.
       </para>
       <para>
        His calculations clearly inflate the compensation package so as to provide not just for the tax on current consumption but also to provide additional compensation now for future consumption out of current savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is arguing against the proposition that that is how the compensation should work-that is, to compensate future savings-and he is claiming that the White Paper supports his position against my current position.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is he is entirely wrong about that. The fact is that that is the proposition he is pursuing. He and Access Economics are saying that any compensation need not just be paid on consumption tax paid but also on future savings and, hence, future consumption. He is advocating a tax which does not fully compensate taxpayers.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, someone earning $500 a week spends $450 and saves $50. The process being put forward by the honourable member for Flinders is that prices will go up by 10 per cent, say, with the consumption tax but this person will get a tax cut on only $45 a week, that is, 9 per cent of income-in other words, an explicit cut in real disposable income. In other words, there will be a tax of 10 per cent and 9 per cent will be given back.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask honourable members to think for a moment what this means. The shadow Treasurer is going to introduce a consumption tax which explicitly cuts real incomes and believes that the community is not going to attempt to recoup that loss of real income. He believes that the trade unions and wage and salary earners generally will say, `Yes, you can levy a 10 per cent tax on us but only give us back 9 per cent.' Of course, it is complete nonsense.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shadow Treasurer's claim yesterday, as I said, was completely wrong. The 1985 draft White Paper was predicted on completely maintaining the real purchasing power of income spent on consumption, completely maintaining the real purchasing power of income spent on savings, and adding some extra on top of that. It was over compensation. Those who remember the debate back in 1985 will remember the questions about over compensation. If one turns to page 10 of the draft White Paper one will find a table headed:
       </para>
       <para>
        Net Gains: Excess of income tax cuts over increase in consumption tax paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        It then lists those particular increases in the document. In other words, the table shows that at every income level the then option C provided net gains and disposable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point of my speech last week was that, because of the broadening of the tax base and the exclusion of restricted goods such net gains are no longer possible. That was the very essence of what I was telling the honourable member for Flinders. Because the game has changed since, that net gains table would not be possible. Any such table introduced by the honourable member would have net losses.

In other words, the White Paper quite forthrightly said that the purchasing power of assets held prior to the date of increased consumption taxation would fall if the assets' nominal value and post tax stream of returns did not rise sufficiently to compensate for the rise in the price level. In other words, it was completely forthright in saying--

That is the point. It is a completely different point. He has picked this up.

With regard to past savings it sets a straight loss and was honest enough to say so. On future savings it was over compensation. But he has his foot in his mouth again with a press statement confusing the fact that future savings are the taxed references to past savings.

         â€”In answer to the honourable member's question, we have received an interim report from Professor Russell Linke of Wollongong University who has been working on the project to look at the question of a charter of academic freedom and institutional autonomy. In his report he did not, contrary to what the honourable member suggests, advocate abandoning the proposal. But he did suggest a distinctly modified set of ideas as to how that should be proceeded with. In particular he made a distinction between the question of academic freedom on the one hand and the question of institutional autonomy on the other.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On the question of academic freedom, it does seem that there really is very little genuine concern in the higher education community about the prospect of loss of academic freedom as such in the sense of people being able to express ideas, conduct research and so forth. There is a more substantive issue to do with institutional autonomy. When the institutions talk about academic freedom they tend to equate it with institutional autonomy whereas in actual fact if one talks to other participants in the higher education sector one gets a rather different perspective. For example, in discussion with the higher education staff unions they argue that some of the most significant threats to academic freedom come from within the institutions themselves. There is a balance to be struck between those two and there is a tension between academic freedom and institutional autonomy. So essentially Professor Linke's interim advice was that academic freedom is probably not appropriately the subject of legislative action to protect, even though the academic staff unions tend to favour that. His view is that the Government should go for a broad statement of principle on matters relating to academic freedom.
       </para>
       <para>
        On institutional autonomy-the basis of the complaints coming from the higher education community relate to institutional autonomy-he advocates developing a proposal that would involve seeking to prescribe what information and what obligations would lie with institutions to limit and prescribe those things. That is the approach he favours and that is the second arm of his interim report.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is within the community an immense diversity of opinion regarding institutional autonomy-about whether the changes that have been introduced post the White Paper constitute a threat to institutional autonomy. There is a big difference between the opinions of people associated with the old established universities, on the one hand, and the opinions of people associated with the old advanced education sector, on the other. If we confine our attention to institutions in the advanced education sector, it is clear and unambiguous that the new White Paper arrangements give them a greater degree of discretion and autonomy than the previous arrangements whereby in New South Wales, for example, every individual course in an institution in the advanced education sector would have to be accredited by State authorities. They are now to be given a great deal more freedom in that respect. With respect to the traditional universities, a survey has been carried out by Meek and Groedegebuure from the University of New England on attitudes of managers of higher education institutions.

That material showed that, while there are some concerns about institutional autonomy, even though there is still a great deal of ambiguity-for example, the creation of larger amalgamated institutions. Quite a few of the managers thought that that would give them greater bargaining clout vis-a-vis the Government than do the existing arrangements. So even on the autonomy question there is ambiguity.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In conclusion, in response to the honourable member's question about the proposed charter of academic freedom and institutional autonomy, the Government started to go down this track as a response to perceived concerns from sections of the higher education community. So far most of the vice-chancellors, the councils of directors and principals, and the organisations which represent the higher education institutions have by and large been hostile to the idea and not supportive of it. They do not see it as providing any kind of protection or assistance to them. We have had a somewhat more ambiguous response from the academic staff unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this point the Government's position is that, if it becomes clear that there is not support for the proposition within the higher education community, if it becomes clear that the various conceptual problems involved in constructing a charter of academic freedom and institutional autonomy appear to be insurmountable-there are some very difficult problems; and I do not believe it has been done successfully anywhere-and if it is clear that there is not support for the proposal, the Government will not continue to progress down that track. I say that to honourable members here and now. We are waiting with interest to hear the final report from Professor Linke.

         â€”Since 1983 the Government has sought through the accord and on a consensus based model to change the way the craft system in Australia has functioned. As we have succeeded in getting aggregate wage flexibility, we are now in the process of rationalising the basis of union organisation and award coverage so as to guarantee and induce more flexibility between awards and within sectors of the economy. It is worth recording that since 1983 the performance of the labour market has improved considerably with a fundamental rebalancing of the wage and profit shares.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the past six years real unit labour costs have fallen by 14 per cent and business fixed investment has increased as a share of gross domestic product from 10.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. The wage share is better than at 1960 levels. The profit share is higher than at 1960s levels. Industrial disputation has more than halved. Job growth has run at 25 per cent. So a work force of six million in 1983 has become a work force of 7 3/4 million in this period. The unions over this period have recognised that high profitability and comparative wages have been essential.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words the accord has enabled the craft structure to work as well as it possibly could, and we are now on the basis of rationalising those outcomes. Today we have average weekly earnings figures out for February 1990 which show that for the year to February 1990 average weekly earnings grew-this is for all employees; average weekly total earnings-by 6.6 per cent; or over the quarter, 1.7 per cent, well within, of course, the Budget forecast. But today, Mr Speaker, there was a further demonstration of the Opposition's confusion about wages policy. The honourable member for Bennelong is quoted in the Australian Financial Review under the headline `Libs now wary of 20 big unions' as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am becoming increasingly sceptical about the headlong race to union amalgamations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess I have for a long time gone along with the view that big is beautiful in this area because you break down the demarcation disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        But I am beginning to see the mega-union concept of the ACTU as being the last gasp of the corporate state in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        You will, if you get 20 unions, have a very strong power constellation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article goes on to say that he is planning to sharpen his focus on enterprise unions. And the honourable member went further on to say that the fears of business groups in terms of flow-ons were unfounded. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The flow-on is greatly exaggerated . . . The world is greatly different from what it was in 1980-81,
       </para>
       <para>
        The article then states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The massive unemployment which resulted from the wage explosion of 1981 had taught people hard lessons about the long-term effect of unreasonable wage demands.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Howard is keen to extend the concept of enterprise-based unionism and enterprise bargaining-
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, nothing could demonstrate more clearly the total confusion on the Opposition side about wages policy. No reference is made to the fact that if we do not rationalise the union structure 320 unions will remain. I do not know what the honourable member thinks those 320 unions are going to do when he then wishes to embark upon an enterprise basis for wage determination. Will they just pack their bags, not attend, not appear, not have an opinion, not do anything?
       </para>
       <para>
        Against the phenomenal changes I have just mentioned-those enormous changes which would have been, on the other side of the House, undreamt of in 1983 real unit labour costs down by 14 per cent, the profit share at an all time high, wage share at 1960s levels, business fixed investment up from 10 3/4 to 39 per cent of gross domestic product and 25 per cent employment growth-one would think that the Opposition would at least say, `Well, these fellows have got something here; there is something working right'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), business and the Government are moving to a structure which contains the revision of job classification, multiskilling and minimum award rates, and brings down the 320-odd unions to a smaller number of broad based unions covering various sectors of the economy. The fact is that this cannot be done without rationalising the structure first, getting rid of the 320 classifications in the metal industries and going to 14 broadbanded classifications, and having a minimum award rate structure in place, so that we are not cutting the earnings rates of the very low paid. We need to do that to get that kind of consensus basis together. But the Opposition says, `It would not happen again'. The fact of the matter is that it would happen again, and the view of the honourable member for Bennelong that what happened in 1980-81 is different is not right.
       </para>
       <para>
        In November 1988 I was ringing the managers of major industrial companies stopping them from paying a 15 or 16 per cent wage round. The ACTU was in there stopping that kind of stuff. The slightest pressure in a period of demand and out these things all spring again. This is a sort of Alice in Wonderland approach. The Opposition's belief that because the Government, under the accord, has kept these 6 3/4 per cent wage numbers coming out then in some way there could be an enterprise bargain with all these little companies through the economy, with 300-odd unions, and that there will not be a break-out in wages and a period of accelerating demand, is of course just fairyland stuff. It is just childish. The fact is that Opposition members are no further advanced now than when the Prime Minister and I answered our first question in 1983 about wage determination. And here they are back prattling the same stuff--

         â€”Well, the Leader of the Opposition has always got the wrong answer. The fact is he never recognises national progress and companies that are involved in the rationalisation do not want a bar of the Opposition policy. That is why they are all saying to the Government at the business lunches, `Well, we hope you guys get up'. Most of them would be voting at the polling booths for honourable members opposite hoping that the Government would win. Of course, that is what happened. The fact of the matter is the reason the Government won is that they know this is tripe. I said this the other day and it is not my position to give the Opposition advice but here is a bit of free stuff: Go back and do some basic policy work. If the Opposition just wants to retail all the policies or non-policies it had in the last Parliament, well the same thing will happen to the Opposition at the next election as happened at the last. I suppose the Government has a vested interest in the Opposition keeping it up and all I can say is that today the Opposition is keeping it up well. If we look at the shadow Treasurer's performance during the week and last night in not even being able to read a basic source document, and the former Treasurer trying to do it all again as he did it in 1981 and 1982, and never learning anything, then is it any wonder that the business community and a great body of the Australian public have given up hope on the Opposition.

I am talking about inflation going to 6 per cent in the next financial year. The Opposition had an objective taking it to zero. What interest rate would honourable members opposite apply, what draconian and vicious recession would they induce and what price asset values under them, with an objective of having a zero inflation rate; that is using a monetary policy to just beat the economy to a pulp, to beat activity to a pulp, to beat companies and employees to a pulp, and to pull inflation down to zero. At what price the decline in asset values and the decline in inflation under that policy? Under our policy we are reducing inflation by a very ambitious monetary policy, the most ambitious fiscal policy in the nation's history, the first series of negative outlays growth ever, the first surplus.

The first surplus in our Federal history, a succession of them, the first public sector surplus ever, the most ambitious fiscal policy ever, negative outlays growth for four successive Budgets, real high rates of interest which have been applied to reduce the rate of growth in spending in the economy and that decline in inflation which is coming from the price taking that occurred in the main when demand was up in the period 1988-89 will obviously be unwound.

        But what the Opposition is about is an entirely different thing. The Opposition is about reducing inflation to zero by the use of a vicious monetary policy. Then the Opposition is asking me about asset prices. Of course asset prices boom in a boom, and of course they come back as the boom subsides. It has happened on each and every occasion. What the Opposition is asking me is about the level. Well, who can be certain about the level? One thing that would be certain is the level would be catastrophic if the Opposition applied a policy which would reduce inflation to zero simply using a vicious monetary policy while the weakened fiscal policy is providing tax cuts to high income earners.

As honourable members will recall, last week I indicated the Government's concern about the delays in payment to Australian wool exporters by the Soviet Government. I said then it appeared that the delays appeared to be due to the reorganisation of the foreign trade system in the Soviet Union. I stressed then, as I do now, that these were not defaults, but delays in payment.

        At that meeting the Government undertook to make representations at the highest levels in the Soviet Union about these delays and express our concerns. I can report to the House today that the Australian Ambassador to Moscow met with representatives of the Soviet Government yesterday to discuss this issue and register those concerns. The ambassador has been informed by the Soviet authorities that they anticipated that all outstanding payments to Australian wool exporters for the months of March and April would be paid either later this week or early next week. Similar assurances have been received from the Soviet wool organisation Novo Export. This is a very positive development. I will keep the House informed of the ongoing issue.

The honourable member asks a question which has no basis in logic or that which has been put in policy by the shadow Treasurer. It only extends the logic of the question put to me yesterday, which begs the question that the Opposition is proposing that the Government should remove these anomalies by taxing all foods at the same rate. If the honourable member wants to tax meat and vegetables and butter at the same rate he should say so, but he should not ask questions which he thinks make a clever point but which make no point at all because there is a basis of differentiation between these applications of various rates in the system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I made the point yesterday and I make it again: the great body of the tax in the wholesale sales tax on the goods is at 20 per cent and a minority of the revenue comes from the 10 and 30 per cent categories. If the lot were put together, it would run out to a rate averaging around 18 per cent. But the fact of the matter is it provides the Government and the tax system with some discretion as to whether or not one wants to tax a certain beverage or item at 10, 20 or 30 per cent. Because there are only 75,000 taxpayers, it is a relatively efficient tax and a very efficient one to collect.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, what is perceived to be the great technical complexity and difficulty in administering the sales tax is overdone in comment. That is the truth of the matter. We could easily go to an 18 per cent rate-but all the things taxed at 10 per cent then go up to 18 per cent. The honourable member is arguing that all the things taxed at zero-food, clothing, butter and all that stuff-go to 10 per cent or 20 per cent. If that is what he is arguing, he should say so.

         â€”I believe that everyone associated with the wool industry now appreciates the seriousness of the package of decisions which they will have to make over the next couple of weeks. The seriousness of the current situation is underlined by the fact that there is now bipartisan political support for the compromise position on the maximum rate of wool levy which the industry should impose upon itself. I place on record the Government's appreciation for the decision apparently made by the Opposition to support the levy legislation. People should be aware that 20 per cent represents effectively a 400 per cent increase in the amount of levy going to the minimum reserve price scheme.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At present the levy is 8 per cent of proceeds, with 3.5 per cent of that for promotion, 0.35 per cent for research and development, and so far 4.15 per cent going to the minimum reserve price scheme itself. From that level the industry piled up a reserve of some $1.8 billion over the years. By increasing the levy to a 20 per cent maximum, if all that was applied, even with a bit of an increase for promotion and research and development, it is a 400 per cent increase that the industry is taking upon itself. Of course, many in the industry were willing to take on something like a 500 per cent increase in the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are all aware that from time to time it is possible for people in our agricultural industries to accuse governments and politicians of involving themselves for political reasons in agricultural matters. This is not one of those times. Both the Opposition and the Government acknowledge the importance of doing everything we can to ensure that our pre-eminent farm industry will not simply survive but continue to prosper in the years ahead.

       <para>
        Wool is not just a major contributor to our export earnings. There is a sense still in this country that wool is a symbol of Australia's economic capacity. Australia is very good at producing agricultural products which are intrinsically valuable and which will always be in demand at the right price. Wool is certainly in that category.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate, for the benefit of the honourable member, that the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation must reach the right decisions on the package of issues which will determine their future. These are the level of the wool levy, the manageable level of the wool stock, the marketing of promotional strategies which will enable us to sell wools of all descriptions, the sustainable level of borrowings, and the floor price.

         â€”I wish to formally advise the House of the retirement on 14 March this year of Mr John Martin Campbell, Principal Parliamentary Reporter since February 1985, and to extend to him publicly the deep appreciation of the Parliament for his services. John Campbell was born in Brisbane and began his reporting career with the Queensland State Reporting Bureau in 1953. In August 1960 he joined the Parliamentary Reporting Staff in Canberra as a reporter and was promoted to senior reporter in May 1971, supervisor in May 1974, Leader of Staff in January 1979 and Assistant Principal Parliamentary Reporter in May 1981. As I have mentioned, he became Principal Parliamentary Reporter, the head of the Hansard department, in February 1985.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Throughout his long career with the Commonwealth Parliament, John Campbell earned the friendship and respect of very many members and senators who served in both Houses over that period. Had the Parliament sat earlier this year prior to Mr Campbell's retirement, the only member of either House who was in the Parliament when John Campbell came to Canberra would have been Tom Uren, the former member for Reid. Hansard reporters are frequently the chroniclers of history, and during his service with Hansard John Campbell reported many momentous events in the Parliament, both in this building and in the provisional House. He observed seven Prime Ministers and recorded the historic Joint Sitting of the Parliament following the 1974 double dissolution.
       </para>
       <para>
        John also witnessed the growth in numbers and scope of committees of this Parliament. Early in his career he travelled throughout northern Australia on an inquiry into Aboriginal matters and subsequently travelled through Australia and Papua New Guinea with a diverse range of committees. As head of Hansard, John Campbell represented the Commonwealth Parliament at the annual conferences of the Australasian Hansard Association and the Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout his dedicated service to the Parliament, Mr Campbell ensured that the other aspects of human endeavour were not neglected. He has always been active in his church and committed to his family. Not surprisingly, given his Queensland origins, he is a keen football follower but converted, so to speak, to Australian rules football during his period in Canberra. I suppose we all make mistakes.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of all members of the House I wish John Campbell a long, enjoyable and productive retirement and sincerely thank him for his untiring efforts for this Parliament. Mr John Templeton has taken up duty as the Secretary of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and Mr Bernie Harris has been appointed the Chief Hansard Reporter.

What happens to the Bills determines what happens to us. If there is a requirement for us to come back then we will. If the Senate is sticking to its intention to sit for four weeks it will be Thursday and Friday of that fourth week. If it is longer it will be the two days before when we can assess when the Senate is likely to rise. There is a possibility that if we come back for two days we will add one day to it.

The second is to control what is being described now as the Button-Keating situation. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) was initially at fault, of course, in a clear breach of accepted standards of ministerial responsibility and Cabinet solidarity. The Prime Minister chose the soft option-not to speak to him; indeed to back him and to have a go at Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Of course, Senator Button retaliated and performed the same breach as the Treasurer had of those well accepted principles of Cabinet solidarity. Of course, the Prime Minister has subsequently let that situation drift.
       </para>
       <para>
        This leadership vacuum makes a mockery of our parliamentary system when there are such clear-cut principles-as evidenced in relation to Cabinet solidarity in Alan Browning's House of Representatives Practice, pages 86 and 87-that are so blatantly breached, and those breaches are treated so lightly and incompetently by the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, my concern today is to concentrate on the second paralysis, and that is the policy paralysis, of which we have had considerably increased evidence over several days. I would appeal to those that are left in the gallery in this respect: the excessive focus on Parliament as a scene for blood sports and political scalps may well be obscuring what is a very real and a very important issue in terms of economic policy in this country; that is, the fundamental difference of opinion that presently exists between the two key economic spokesmen in the Government. The Treasurer is No. 2 in the Government and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce is No. 3 in the Government. They have fundamentally different views about our current economic circumstances and fundamentally different views about the appropriate policy responses. These differences are, of course, long-standing and have been compounded over the years by a number of events, but particularly by the Treasurer's grab for power in July 1987 in the sense that he took control of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and claimed to be taking control of the micro-reform agenda at the same time.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that we focus on these differences because they are, I believe, fundamental to the policy paralysis we see at the present time in this Government. It is the fundamental reason why our economic circumstances have been left to drift into recession at a time when we are as a nation particularly exposed to an increasingly difficult international economic environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the benefit of the House let me briefly identify the two views. We will call one the Keating view and the other the Button view. There are a number of key elements to the Keating view. Firstly, it is a view that is driven by a belief that it is important to get the macro-economic picture or, as the Treasurer describes it, the big picture right. He believes this is the best way to restructure the economy and to facilitate micro-reform. He claims to have done that-and I say `claims'-by both fiscal and wage restraint. Several political considerations have intervened in that strategy, such that he has run a decidedly easier fiscal and wages policy than he had initially claimed, such that the great bulk of the work in the policy sense is now being done by monetary policy and by what has been shown up as an increasing and sustained reliance on high interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against that background, though, the Treasurer tends to take a selective view of what is happening in the economy-to talk about things like the improvement in corporate profitability, the shift in the profit wage share, the fact that there has not been an identified wage explosion, the size of the fiscal turnaround-as he did today-the so-called investment boom, the strength of employment growth and so on. On that basis he incessantly says-and guarantees in fact-that there will be a soft landing and that there will be no recession. Indeed, it is an essential element of his policy that we should have a soft landing and that demand growth in particular should move back in line with production growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, two things are becoming increasingly apparent. Firstly, recession is the logical consequence of that policy strategy; indeed, some would say that it is the hidden agenda of that policy strategy. Excessive reliance on high interest rates has driven this economy into recession already. The second logical consequence of that policy approach is continued falls in living standards. Of course, Mr Keating will not admit either of these things. He cannot do so because he has spent so long trying to convince his colleagues and everyone else that it will not happen, that we will not have a recession. So, if he did admit that we are in a recession, it would be seen that his whole policy strategy had failed. As a result of that, with the release of every piece of economic data the Treasurer has been maintaining an increasingly ridiculous charade-indeed, a pathetic and ridiculous charade. It has eaten into his credibility to the point where he has become now the subject of considerable ridicule. Of course, he has been compounding that situation by some of his recent actions. I refer, for example, to the way that he has dropped the standard definition of recession-he has made a mockery of that-and put in place his own definition of recession, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the frustrations came to a head at the start of the week with his attack on Senator Button when he was hoping to eliminate or minimise the internal criticism that had been growing against him within his Party and within the electorate generally, with perhaps the implicit hope that Senator Button would be fired. But the Treasurer has become the subject of ridicule. As one leading economist, Paddy McGuinness in the Australian, summarised it:
       </para>
       <para>
        But we are not on the correct course of economic policy to bring the Australian economy right, and we never will be so long as the Treasurer clings pig-headedly to his belief in his own superior judgment. However, while Mr Keating is an amateur of talent when it comes to economics, he has absolutely no claim to either wisdom or knowledge in the field.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        But as far as Australian economic policy is concerned he deserves only one message-for God's sake, go!
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the overwhelming assessment of our Treasurer at present across a large part of the media and of course in the business community both here and overseas. It is interesting that some of our friends in the press gallery-one in particular today-attacked me for not going after Senator Button's scalp in the context of the events of this week. They have missed the point. Why would we go after Senator Button's scalp? He is the good guy in this. He is the guy who is contributing significantly to the national debate. He is the guy who is giving the honest version of what is happening. Of course, he is the one who is just simply telling the truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        That leads me quite naturally into the Button view by comparison with the Keating view. Button essentially argues that the current macro-economic strategy is killing the scope for reform. He favours a more interventionist style, which I do not agree with. He pushes for a more interventionist style, which one journalist has described as a situation in which business needs prompting, goading and incentives. But he has argued a number of key points about macro-policy. First, he emphasises his excessive reliance on monetary policy and high interest rates. Secondly, Senator Button has pointed out that this has had a double whammy on the corporate sector and our overall economic welfare. High interest rates have cut into corporate profitability and they are now significantly eating into business investment, the key to any successful restructuring program. Of course, high interest rates have significantly appreciated the Australian dollar, which has eaten into the competitiveness of our domestic industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button has been very clear in those two criticisms of the Keating strategy. He argues that we are in the midst of an economic downturn of some severity-he therefore immediately disagrees with the Treasurer-and he goes on to say that he does not think that it is really fair or appropriate to talk about rising living standards in such circumstances. So, where the Treasurer denies the recession, Button hints that one is on. Where the Treasurer promises rising living standards, Button concedes that it is unrealistic, under that strategy, to expect any. Of course, he has gone on with other detail in other places to emphasise that a lot of the investment that we are getting is not going to the right place; it is not creating the capacity for us to service our increased debt or to turn around our balance of payments to a sustainable level.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are left in a situation of policy paralysis where a number of people on the other side, including the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is sitting at the table, have chipped in and put their views about the significant consequences of this basic neglect. This week the Treasurer made a strong case that he was the agent of change-he is the one who will pull the country out of this mire.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find that very hard to believe for several reasons, one being that he has never been the agent of change. We only have to look at the Treasurer's handling of the Industries Assistance Commission, now the Industry Commission, since he took it over in 1987. We have had about 25 months of sustained inactivity. The director resigned, a new director-an ex-staff member of the Treasurer-was appointed and he immediately criticised the Treasurer for inactivity and slow pace of reform. There are many other examples through that period of references not being made, of reports not being delivered and so on. Of course, the Treasurer remains hogtied at the present time by the ACTU, which simply will not contemplate significant micro-economic reform in what are recession circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The key factor here is unemployment. Unemployment has already jumped since October last year by about 30,000. On reasonable forecasts that are around in financial markets, unemployment will rise by another 100,000 or 110,000 by the middle of next year. Can honourable members seriously imagine, in that context, that the Treasurer will push significantly for micro-reform and significant change to the structure of industries if any of those changes have any additional effect on unemployment? The answer is no. We are in for a fourth term of the Hawke-Keating Government which will be very much like the third term of that Government: total inactivity on the micro-economic reform front.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today, the Treasurer sat here in blissful isolation maintaining this ridiculous facade that there is no recession. Anybody in this House who walks anywhere in his or her electorate only has to look at the number of vacant shops and the number of businesses that have gone broke or pick up a newspaper and look at the advertisements in the auction columns to see the extent to which average Australian families and businesses are struggling under the force of these high interest rates with much worse still to come and with record levels of personal bankruptcies and small business failures. And he maintains this charade.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to finish with a positive suggestion for the Treasurer. There are very few opportunities in any government's life to make significant economic change. This Treasurer has had a few. He had the opportunity he created with the exchange rate crisis in 1985. He had another one with the banana republic statement and another with the stock market crash, either one of which would have provided him with an opportunity to make substantial change. I issue him a challenge to embark on the process of substantial change now, to admit he has been wrong and to take the opportunity of the remainder of this year to make significant change in three respects.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer should make a major economic statement to this House, at the resumption of this Parliament, in which he puts down a very clear-cut assessment of where this economy is and provides forecasts of where it is going over the next three years with reasonable Forward Estimates of Government expenditure. Indeed, it would be nice for once to get some estimates of likely Government tax revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer should seize the opportunity at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings which will take place in late June to do a number of things. First, he should ensure that the States share in the necessary fiscal restraint. It should be a matching of restraint on the Commonwealth's own expenditure and State expenditure as a minimum. Secondly, he should initiate discussions designed to eliminate duplication between the Commonwealth and the States in terms of expenditure function. Thirdly, he should initiate a major exercise for identifying the scope for privatisation and contracting out at both the Commonwealth and the State level as part of that process. Fourthly, he could take the opportunity of locking the States into the process of micro-economic reform on that particular occasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        This last point is very important because so much needs to be done in this country in terms of micro-reform and structural reform which has a very important State dimension and involves a significant amount of cooperation. For example, what needs to be done in the areas of health, education, infrastructure development, roads, rail transport and the waterfront has a significant State dimension. He should take the opportunity of this year's Budget to make a major economic statement which brings down a new wages policy that links wages more to productivity, which offers a significantly tighter fiscal policy and which offers a significantly different tax policy with substantial cuts in marginal tax rates and a shift in the nature of the tax mix, and to provide a detailed agenda for micro-reform for the remaining period of the fourth Hawke-Keating Government.

         â€”Seven weeks ago the people of Australia assessed the respective economic policies of the Opposition and the Government and re-elected the Government for the fourth time in seven years. What that indicates is that the people of Australia are not fools. They realise what happened in the previous 33 years before we came into office-for 30 of which the Liberal-National parties ran this country and drove it into a state of recession, stagflation and enormous structural inefficiency. That was the legacy of 30 years of Liberal-National Party government in this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The shadow Treasurer, who is apparently to speak in this debate, thought he had found a new word the other day when he came up with the word `stagflation'. If he wants to see stagflation, he ought to have a look back at what it was like in 1982-83. When the Labor Party came into office in 1983 we had inflation and unemployment both at double digit levels. Opposition members now talk to us about stagflation. They are the experts on stagflation; they invented the whole process. We never had it in Australia before the Fraser Government came into office and certainly gave us large heaps of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the Opposition's economic policy simply lacks credibility, as the people of Australia assessed, and for very good reasons. The reasons were simply that Opposition members had $7 billion of unfunded promises which would obviously have led them to higher interest rates; they had no credible wages policy or credible fiscal policy; how could they possibly, therefore, propose solutions to Australia's problems? They had no credible alternative economic policy. It is all very well for the now Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to stand up here and tell us what the policy should be a few weeks after an election in which he was the economic spokesman and clearly put up a policy which was not credible and which was repudiated by the Australian people, and for good reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        The subject of this matter of public importance (MPI) is the so-called Government's policy paralysis. The fact is, there is no policy paralysis under this Government. The Opposition might accuse us of all sorts of things, but for God's sake, do not accuse us of policy paralysis, because it is just an absurd statement. There can be no way in which anyone could say that this Government had not been a reforming government in terms of the economic structure of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        No government since Federation has attacked the economy of this country to reform it, to put it into some sort of decent shape, to redress the disaster of the previous 30 years or so from the other side running this country, and to give us a chance for the future. No government in the history of Federation has engaged in such a fundamental program of economic reform. Any aspect of our economic policy shows that that is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened with macro-economic policy? Well, obviously there has been a tremendous turnaround. The $9m deficit when we came into office has been turned into a $9 billion surplus. Very few countries in the western industrial world can run a national Budget surplus. We are running such a surplus. Not only that, for the whole public sector we now have a net public sector borrowing requirement which is in fact a surplus. We have no public sector call on national savings at all. That sort of turnaround has never happened before in our history. In the last couple of years, last year and this year, we have that overall net public sector borrowing requirement surplus.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a total transformation of the national account; a total transformation of the way in which the Government runs the accounts of this country and the economy of this country in terms of its own involvement and the involvement of the other governments in this country. Through the process of the Budget and through the process of the Loan Council we have been able to transform that public sector call on the national savings totally, so that we now have no such call at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of a nation which has historically not had a high level of national savings that is a very important change and one which will bring about, as time goes on, great structural improvement. It will not happen overnight, clearly, but it certainly is a major factor in improving savings in this country, and something which the previous Government never got within cooee of doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        So at the macro level there can be no argument that there has been total transformation. We are running a very tight fiscal policy. No-one can accuse us of running a loose fiscal policy. As I said, virtually no other country is running a surplus and there has been a total transformation in the Budget of $18 billion in the period that we have been in office from a $9 billion deficit to a $9 billion surplus. Now those are tremendous changes and it means therefore, as I said in relation to the public sector borrowing requirement, that when we came into office it was in fact 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the net public sector borrowing requirement. Now it is minus 1.2 per cent. What an incredible turnaround.
       </para>
       <para>
        At that level, quite clearly, there is a tremendous change for the better because we all know that we need to improve our savings so there is less call on national savings if we are to attack the current account problem. Of course the current account problem was a major legacy from previous conservative governments which ran us through most of the post-war period. Not only did they give us stagflation, not only did they give us a public account with a massive public sector deficit, but also they gave us a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP and gave us an industrialised country, so-called, behind the high tariff walls totally non-competitive, totally inefficient in terms of any world level of activity and totally unable therefore to give us a pattern of exports, which would enable us to ride out any fall in commodity prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were an industrialised country with a Third World patter of exports. That is what the National-Liberal Party governments gave us in the post-war period. They industrialised this country in a way which gave us a Third World pattern of exports. Of course that was the problem in the 1980s. We then had the fall in commodity prices in 1984-85 and we were rocked by that infinitely more than other industrialised countries which have agricultural exports, such as Canada or the United States, because they have a far more diverse pattern of exports. We did not have it because it was this group on the Opposition side which ran this country so badly for so long and which gave us a totally uncompetitive manufacturing industry, totally uncompetitive service industries. This gave us therefore a totally distorted pattern of exports and left this country absolutely vulnerable. That is the lesson that we all well and truly learned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question is how to get out of that mess. Part of the way of getting out is the fiscal reform which I have already outlined to the House and which of course is well known to many anyway; that is, the total need to have far less call on overseas savings and for the public sector to play its role in that by improving national savings. But not only that of course. We also have to make manufacturing industry more efficient and so who has taken the action to make manufacturing industry more efficient? It has been Labor governments. The Whitlam Government, much criticised, at least saw the need to do it and took the 25 per cent cut in tariffs and that was the first step. Nothing happened under Fraser and then we came into office.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a program continuing since we came into office of improving manufacturing industries' competitiveness, reducing the tariff barriers, reducing non-tariff barriers and basically building up our manufacturing industry. Gradually we are becoming a nation which can export more in the way of manufactured goods and also, I must say, in the way of services. But it has been this Government that has done that. The National-Liberal Party governments never got around to anything like that. It was this Government also which said that we have to improve competitiveness by bringing wages under control and we did it through the accord. The Opposition continually tells us the accord is a terrible thing but it has no wages policy. We all recall the then Leader of the Opposition in the course of the last election campaign when being asked what his wages outcome would be saying, `Who knows; who knows?', and of course nobody knew-least of all him or the present Leader of the Opposition. Under the policy of the Opposition, it would have no wages policy. It would simply live on a hope and a prayer that a wages policy would not be too damaging.
       </para>
       <para>
        Members of the Opposition have all this comforting rhetoric about the workers and the management getting together and producing nice outcomes. It might sound nice at a Liberal Party branch meeting but it is idiocy out there in the marketplace, as is known well and truly to people in industry, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said at Question Time. The fact is that the Opposition must have a wages policy that it can deliver on. Until it has that it has no credible policy at all. That was part of the deficiency of the Opposition during the election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, our wages policy has been immensely successful. It has meant that there has been a very substantial reduction in real wage costs. It has meant that there has been a big increase in profits share. It has meant, therefore, that there has been a real incentive to invest. It has meant that our competitiveness has improved enormously and given us a chance to get a wider array of exports through manufacturing and services. It has given us a real chance to become a country which can have a future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The accord, rather than being decried, should be seen as something which was very much needed. Of course, it is an evolving process. As it evolves, it is becoming more flexible and the flexibility which the Opposition talks about is something which is gradually being built into the process. But we will certainly not take up the Opposition's policy, which would be to throw away the accord and simply hope on the expectation of flexibility that it would get an appropriate wages outcome. That would be an absolute absurdity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, in micro-economic reform we have taken a tremendous number of steps. The Opposition keeps asking what is happening in micro-economic reform and saying that nothing has been done. Nothing could be further from the truth. No government in history has tackled micro-economic reform as we have. Certainly no Australian government-and I would venture to say no government anywhere-has engaged in as much micro-economic reform as we are now undertaking unless that government is transferring from communism to capitalism as some East European countries are doing. Apart from that kind of fundamental transformation, I cannot think of any country in the western industrialised world which has ever attacked its micro-economic structure in the way in which this Government has-in crucial areas, of course.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shipping and the waterfront are two areas that are talked about by the Opposition in gross ignorance of what is going on. In shipping we have seen a tremendous change in productivity in the last 18 months. There has been a 20 per cent increase in productivity in the shipping industry in the last 18 months. Another 20 per cent is to come in the next 18 months. Is that no progress on micro-economic reform?
       </para>
       <para>
        On the waterfront we will see enterprise employment in place in our major ports by the end of this year. Is that no progress on micro-economic reform? The coalition sat for decades, just letting the old cost plus system wander on. It said: `Let it go on. Don't make any real change. Don't worry about being competitive; don't worry about exports; don't worry about manufactured exports; just let it go on, because it is too hard to tackle.' That was its problem. It criticised, but did nothing about the problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has done something about it. Through the course of this year there will be a fundamental transformation of the waterfront. By the end of this term in office, the waterfront industry will be unrecognisable from what it was at the beginning of this period of office. That whole reform program will have brought in enterprise employment and certainly will have brought about an enormous increase in efficiency, not just the 30 per cent that is talked about by the Opposition as providing the only scope for the reform process. That is the minimum increase, but we expect a hell of a lot more than that to come from it as enterprise employment really brings some drive and efficiency into the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have reformed government business enterprises. We have taken tremendous reform steps in aviation, particularly with the deregulation of domestic aviation. Coalition members sat for decades in the post-war period tying up the two-airlines system. Just before they went out of office they tied it up so much that we could not undo it for about seven years. Under the Act they brought in just before they went out of office little could be done. They had no interest in deregulating the aviation industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just instance those few examples as I am running out of time. This Government has undertaken the greatest amount of economic reform of any government since Federation. It needed to do so because of the economic vandalism of the Liberal and National parties who totally corrupted our economy in the post-war period by simply relying on the agricultural and commodity exports and not doing anything to give us a vibrant, dynamic economy with manufacturing industries and service industries which could compete on the world markets. We are doing that and this term of office will show by the end of this three years that we have achieved great progress in that area. I am sure that the people of Australia will go on and elect us once again because our economic policy is infinitely better than anything that is coming from the Opposition.

        The Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Monday this week, to contradict the Minister's contribution a few minutes ago, said that not enough was being done in respect of micro-economic reform. In fact, he said that so little had been done it was a disgrace that he, the Treasurer, had to defend the inadequacies of the Government's economic policy as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many areas of differences and I think that the Parliament and the electorate would have been better served if the Minister had addressed those in a more substantial way. For example, we have had comments from the Treasurer this week in respect of the labour force situation. Basically he says it is being well managed as a result of his policies. But he omitted to acknowledge that unemployment is rising against the background of employment topping out. We have had other surveys, such as the ANZ job advertisements series, for example, predict a 41 per cent drop. In addition to that, most commentators expect a jump of seven to 7.5 per cent in unemployment figures. There is also anecdotal evidence of a deteriorating labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another example of difference lies in the Treasurer's view that it is all the fault of 30 years of coalition government, carefully omitting the fact that by the end of this Parliament the Government of which the Minister is part, the Labor Party, would have been in office for 13 out of the last 20 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to go to the substance of a critical part of this whole economic debate, the whole question of the level of investment in this country. The Minister referred to it in a fleeting way in his remarks and we have had the Treasurer on a number of occasions in this Parliament this week and last week talking about the boom in investment. It is a critical issue; it is the linchpin of Labor's economic policy. I will give the House an example. When the March 1990 balance of payments came out, the Treasurer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        And that simply means restraining spending further while we have more time to see the existing investment phase lift production.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the Treasurer says `Yes, we do have a current account problem; we have a lot of imports coming in.' But he also says that those imports are going into productive capacity and that all will be well in due course because, as that investment takes place, it will produce exports and import replacements. That is critical to the Government's policy. The Treasurer says: `look, it's not just good news on the investment side. We are in fact experiencing a boom; never been better.' He said words to that effect today.
       </para>
       <para>
        In calling for the Government to reassess its policy, as the Leader of the Opposition did today, we substantiate that argument by pointing in fact to the realities of those investment figures. When we look behind the bravado and the bluster of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, we see that unfortunately the great reliance which the Government places on investment is not in fact properly so placed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Legislative Research Service has done a very interesting paper on the whole question of investment. I refer to the figures that the Treasurer relies on. He says that we have the highest percentage of gross domestic product in living memory in respect of business investment, but he cites the statistics selectively. The figures have been analysed, and I raise this matter because I think the Treasurer ought to respond and give us a substantial reply to this attack on his use of the figures. The Legislative Research Service paper says:
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia's case, we have been fortunate in recent years that the same proportion of our incomes will buy more equipment investment. This lower relative cost also explains some of the growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many ways in which to calculate the level of investment. The Treasurer picks that which best suits his political circumstances, but when one analyses the figures it becomes apparent that the rosy picture is but a charade, a mirage. The paper says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Equipment in current price terms has recovered from its low point of the mid-1980s, but was still below the most recent peak in 1981-82 . . . In 1988-89, it was higher than most of the 1970s and similar to many years in the 1950s and 1960s. Overall-
       </para>
       <para>
        and this is the critical part-
       </para>
       <para>
        in official national accounts history, it is lower than 14 previous years, higher than 24, and the same as two other years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it is nonsense for the Treasurer to say that we have an investment boom and that that is the basis upon which our economy will produce its way out of the current account problems. That is not the full story. Public investment is in fact at a record low. The paper then goes on to explain that, when public investment is added to private investment, the total investment is `neither particularly high nor low'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Within these levels of investment, one can understand that the big issue is where these investment funds are actually going. That has also been analysed. Contrary to the very considerable claims of the Treasurer, when one looks at those figures in detail one finds that there is considerable evidence that questions where that investment actually ends up. The calculations show that we have had considerable increased investment in some areas but not in those areas which will necessarily lead to a boost in exports and a boost to production in respect of import substitution. That is a very significant point. This point was made by Senator Walsh in his first article. So significant did he see it as an issue in terms of economic policy that in his Cassandra article he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is doubtful, however, whether the quality and composition of recent investment spending will service the additions to foreign debt, let alone deal with the accumulated deficits of previous years. The 1989 Budget papers showed a significant decline of the proportion of investment in the tradeables sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point that we make is that the Government is again relying on an old friend of the Treasurer, the J-curve. Honourable members will remember that back in 1985-and how this echoes his comments today-the Treasurer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we are seeing a turn in investment practice across the economy which will eventually turn the current account.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was said five years ago, and we got the same line today during Question Time. He also said in 1985:
       </para>
       <para>
        The J-curve effect takes time-it gets worse before it gets better.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a prophecy that was. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the current account deficit is running as we forecast it would. On that score also the Jeremiah stuff we have heard from the other side of the House has no basis to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are very substantial points. They go to the heart of the Treasurer's economic policy and we say that this reveals a fatal flaw in that policy. The truth is that we do not have the investment there that will claw this country out of the economic hole that it is in. The Treasurer should understand that, reassess, and then take stock of the advice given today by the Leader of the Opposition.

         â€”We have had a couple of boring contributions from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith). All I can say to the Deputy Leader is that he was more interesting when he was debating Peter Steedman on radio than he is as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition complained today and in his speech to the National Press Club as reported in the newspaper that he is not getting good enough treatment from the media. He also complains that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) seems to have an amazingly good run in the media. This is interesting, because he then goes on to say that this reflects on the quality of the journalists. What a nonsense. The fact is that it has nothing to do with the quality of the journalists. The journalists can perceive very well who has the correct representation of what is happening in the Australian economy and in the Australian society, and who does not. It is the Leader of the Opposition who does not. We expected that he would come forward with a more intellectually rigorous and more substantial analysis than the kinds of slogans that he came forth with today.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The reason the Treasurer is being given such good media coverage is that on all occasions he had been intellectually rigorous and intellectually courageous. This is something that should be borne in mind by a number of the new members here from the New Right of the Liberal Party, now totally dominating the front bench and of course led by the Deputy Leader. They have these gung-ho, New Right, Thatcherite policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole of the Western world had abandoned Thatcherite policies. The Australian people have rejected Thatcherite policies from this mob opposite on four occasions. Yet when these people are asked something intellectually interesting or rigorous they simply give you the same material, the same policies, again and again, after 10 years. Can we believe it? The whole world has dropped Thatcherite policies, and yet the Opposition in this country is still sticking to the Thatcherite New Right policies. It must be the only Opposition, the only major political party in the whole world, to still do this. In their maiden speeches, the major members of that Party came forth and tried to give us intellectual defences of those same New Right policies that have been rejected by the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask: What is the correct situation? The Leader of the Opposition claimed that only a fool would maintain that we are not in a recession. That is not correct. Everyone can quote different economic commentators and different professors of economics, but it is not correct to say that all commentators maintain that we are in some kind of deep recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that the economic picture is mixed at the moment, as the Treasurer has said. Honourable members opposite talk in contradictory terms. They say that, if the economy has slowed down, we must be in a recession. Yet we made it perfectly clear that it was necessary to slow down economic growth in order to slow demand. That was part of the policy. So, when that happens, honourable members opposite say that the Government has no economic policy, no economic approach. What a nonsense. It was part of what we were trying to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question that honourable members opposite should be asking is whether we will get the result we want. I did not hear a single comment, from either the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on the crucial questions: Are we going to get a turnaround in the current account? Are we going to get a turnaround in the import situation? They did not even ask those questions. Had they been intellectually rigorous, they would have asked these questions. As to the soft landing and the reduction in growth in order to achieve a turnaround in imports, the Opposition should be asking whether we are going to achieve that turnaround.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition did not ask that question; the Leader of the Opposition, who prides himself on being some kind of economic guru, did not even ask the question. He did not even raise the issue. He did not even discuss it. Then he claims that he has got all the other answers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is: we are at a crucial point in the Australian economy. The Opposition's continuing negative comments about the economy are doing no good. This is a serious point I am putting to the Opposition. The Opposition's negative comments are contributing to trying to create a recession. The Opposition ought to be ashamed of itself for some of the comments its members are making. Opposition members are saying there will definitely be growth in unemployment. Opposition members are saying there will be no investment. The fact is Opposition members are trying to discourage investment in this country. They are doing their own country damage by their continual negative criticism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition Leader comes into this House and says, `We want to have a good standard of parliamentary debate. We want to have more intellectual rigour. We want to have more intellectual honesty.' The next thing we see is that he and all his shadow Ministers are encouraging a concept in the Australian community and in business that there is something dreadfully wrong and they should not be investing. That is a very serious situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is happening with the economic policy is this: We want the pattern of investment-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke about the pattern of investment-to continue, and we want it to continue in productive enterprises. We want to have a turnaround in the current account by having import replacement. We want to have more export orientated industries. Therefore, it is in the interests of every responsible politician-every responsible member of parliament-to encourage this investment pattern. Instead of going around knocking our country and our economy, and saying how dreadful things are, we should be saying, `Look, we are in a downturn situation but we can get out of it, and this is the process for getting out of it.' The process is more production, higher productivity and more export orientation. We do not hear anything about this from the Opposition. All we hear is this continual negative carping about the Treasurer because he dares to be optimistic. He dares to say that, in fact, he is going to achieve the soft landing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say to the Opposition, if I had to make a bet, and I had a choice between putting my money on Hewson or Keating, I know very well where I would be making the bet; that is, on the man who has proved over and over again that he can get this economy going, keep it going with high growth, high employment and a very positive situation-and that is the Treasurer of this country. The Opposition's continual attacks are resulting, as I said, in an undermining of the situation in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition talks about policy paralysis. What an impertinent comment in this matter of public importance. If there has ever been policy paralysis it has got to be the demonstration by the Opposition parties here and what they have done in the last 10 years Give us a single new idea that has come from their minds? There has been nothing. As I said before, everything has been pinched from the Thatcherite polices of Great Britain which have failed in Britain. That is all that has happened. I ask the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) to give us one single new idea. Various supposed intellectuals were brought into this place, yet where are the new ideas? All we have heard is the same stuff.
       </para>
       <para>
        The world is changing. The Opposition has to understand that we live in a mixed economy. We live in an economy which is sophisticated and requires very sophisticated judgment in order to get everything right-not simple formulas coming from the New Right about getting rid of all government involvement and having an explosion of wages, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has said, because it has got no wages policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The former Leader of the Opposition made the famous comment, when he was asked what is going to happen with wages, `Well, who knows?'. Of course he has to say that. If the Opposition simply unleashes all the market forces and has no wage policy or wage guidance, no arbitration commission and no role for judgment about national interest, what will it get? I will tell the House what it is going to get. The Opposition is going to get war between the various forces.

       <para>
        In a referral motion that the Minister for Small Business and Customs put to the House on Monday, 14 May, the Minister detailed a proposal for the construction of a multi-user depot at Oakleigh, Victoria for use by various Army reserve units which resulted primarily from a request from the Victorian State Government that the site of an existing depot in Batman Avenue, East Melbourne, adjacent to the National Tennis Centre be vacated for use as open space. The Commonwealth agreed to make the land available to the Victorian State Government as part of a wider Commonwealth-State land transfer agreement. Under that agreement the Department of Defence is required to vacate the Batman Avenue depot by 31 June 1991. A suitable 3.17 hectare site at Oakleigh has been purchased for the construction of a new depot.
       </para>
       <para>
        The construction of a new depot will also allow rationalisation and co-location of like Army reserve functions which is consistent with this Government's policy of rationalising and upgrading defence facilities.

        The Public Works Committee, in its report, noted that there is a need for the Department of Defence to review its policy regarding the provision of access for civilian staff at its establishments and, in addition, recommended that modifications be made to the design of the proposed depot to provide access for people with disabilities.

       That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Housing developments by the Defence Housing Authority at Laverton and Macleod, Victoria, and Bullsbrook, Western Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       A motion the Minister for Small Business and Customs put to the House on Monday, 14 May outlined three housing developments being proposed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) for referral to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination and report and the Government was pleased to hear that the Opposition supports these developments. Briefly, the DHA had purchased the 32.5 hectare site at Laverton in Victoria and a 21 hectare site at Bullsbrook in Western Australia and is negotiating the purchase of a 50 hectare site at Macleod in Victoria to be developed under arrangements with private sector developers to provide a mix of defence and civilian housing. Ultimately the development of these three sites is expected to yield some 980 houses at a total cost of $145m, of which some 400 will be retained by the DHA.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Public Works Committee in its report noted its agreement that a need existed for the provision of appropriate housing for defence personnel and that the proposed housing developments will assist the DHA in providing service families with that housing. It also acknowledged that environmental safeguards and standards must be adopted by the DHA and that it must continue consultations with relevant and interested bodies and persons in relation to the development of these sites. The DHA will ensure that for all projects the due processes of public comment and environmental impact under the relevant state legislation are observed.

        â€”by leave-I would like to speak to all five notices. Firstly, I would like to commend the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for the speed with which it has handled the references it received on Monday. It has been able to handle five references in three days. I think it is a credit to the Committee, the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who I notice is present, and also to the new Deputy Chairman, my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor).

       I would like to make a couple of comments on the Oakleigh multi-user Army Reserve depot. It was, of course, part of the move to allow the Victorian Government to build the tennis centre. While I think most Victorians enjoy that tennis centre I regret to add that, like so many things that the State Government of Victoria has been doing lately, it has not managed to make it a profitable enterprise; in fact, it is losing money. I understand that right now it would be looking forward to a $40m capital injection to maintain its operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The housing developments at Laverton and Macleod and also at Bullsbrook in Western Australia, as I said the other day, are long overdue. Our service personnel have had to put up with some extremely poor housing for many years. They have been long suffering. It is something that should have been addressed many years ago and it is something which I believe the Government has been very tardy in taking up. No doubt much of this housing is, by any standards, appalling and in many cases would not be considered fit for most Australians. It is also worth noting that the Defence Housing Authority, which will be doing the housing developments, is a commercialised venture. We on this side welcome the change in the operation that this has brought about.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to notice No. 3, the construction of the Commonwealth law courts, again we would obviously be in favour of these changes. It does bring about a rationalisation of services in Brisbane and no doubt this should prove to be cost effective.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the question of the Puckapunyal redevelopment, stage 1, in Victoria, again this should lead to a rationalisation of facilities and an integration. It should also lead to operational efficiency improvements. I am sure that all honourable members would support that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now refer to notice No. 5, the redevelopment of the army aviation centre at Oakey, in Queensland. My colleague the honourable member for Groom has a very keen interest in this, not only because he happens to be Deputy Chairman of the Public Works Committee but also because Oakey is in his electorate. He suggested that there is an important need for the Government to re-examine the recommendation by this Committee that a local government grant be made to the Jondaryan Shire Council for a feasibility study on the augmentation of the town and the base water supply.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that for some reason that grant has not been approved. I would hope that the Government might re-consider that because obviously if the water supply for the town of Oakey and for the base could be put together and worked on together there would be greater community and Army cooperation. I would hope that the Minister would take that suggestion on board.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, obviously the Opposition has no problem with these notices and recommendations. Again, I would commend the Committee for its speed. I wonder whether it may be able to handle future references with the same speed. We may see all sorts of new projects.

        â€”For the purpose of completing the record I wish to make the following comments on behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) concerning the Puckapunyal redevelopment, stage 1, in Victoria. The Puckapunyal military area is situated in Victoria, approximately 11 kilometres west of the town of Seymour and 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. On Monday, 14 May the Minister put a motion to the House to refer redevelopment work at the Puckapunyal military area to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for report and examination. The Puckapunyal military area is currently home to three major operational units, two of which are part of the Operational Deployment Force, a newly formed logistic battalion, three major training establishments and various minor units and is considered a significant defence base by the Australian Defence Force. It employs approximately 2,000 service men and women.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The proposed work currently before the House is the first part of a two stage development plan for Puckapunyal and is directly in line with the Government's commitment to improving existing live-in accommodation and rationalising and modernising working accommodation and facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Public Works Committee noted in its report that a need exists to provide permanent living-in accommodation at Puckapunyal to service scales and standards and recognised the advantage of rationalising and integrating logistic facilities at the Puckapunyal Logistic Battalion. It is reassuring to have the full support of the Opposition to the redevelopment of the Puckapunyal military area. On behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, I would also like to thank the Committee for its support for the proposal, and I commend the motion to the House.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to notice No. 3 and on behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, I should place on record that the proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee involves the construction of a purpose designed multi-storey building with associated engineering services to house the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in central Brisbane. In November 1989 expressions of interest were sought for a detailed design documentation construction package to erect the new courts. The preferred developer was Consolidated Properties Ltd in conjunction with Concrete Constructions (Queensland) Pty Ltd, who offered a guaranteed maximum construction cost of $95.91m, subject to the present brief being maintained and a contract being confirmed by October 1990. Completion of the project on the above basis would be by 1993.
      </para>
      <para>
       The former Public Works Committee conducted a hearing of the proposal on 13 February 1990. Subject to Parliament accepting the expendiency motion, the preferred developer will shortly be invited to submit a fixed construction price for the more detailed design that has been developed by Australian Construction Services since the Public Works Committee hearing. The fixed price must lie within the previously offered $95.91m figure. If acceptable, the preferred developer will be offered a contract to finalise the design and undertake documentation and construction. While supporting the proposal on its present site, the Committee suggested that the Attorney-General's Department review the need for courts to be established in `legal precincts', giving particular emphasis to the costs involved and the convenience of the public, staff, judiciary and the legal profession.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department has pointed out that court facilities for the Family Court are provided in several regional centres throughout Australia and that a combined Family Court-Federal Court-AAT building is currently under construction in Parramatta. It also advises that sites have already been purchased for court projects planned for Melbourne and Adelaide. The Department will, however, address the matter of location, together with other factors such as cost and convenience of staff, the public and the judiciary, when these projects are submitted for formal consideration by government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee also requested that the Attorney-General's Department review space allocation within the building with the objective of providing permanently for the needs of the Commonwealth Reporting Service (CRS). The Department has advised that although the CRS will be accommodated initially, a review of space allocation will be made in the building with the objective of providing permanently for the needs of the CRS. The Department will report to the Committee on the outcome of that review.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, the Committee suggested that during the design stage comprehensive consultation be undertaken with the judiciary, staff and staff associations, the legal profession and interested Commonwealth, State and local government bodies. The Attorney-General's Department advises that this has happened and substantial agreement has been reached on planning. Further consultation with staff associations and the legal profession will be undertaken as agreed. Australian Construction Services continues to consult regulatory authorities as necessary. On behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House, as I have done previously.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to notice No. 5 and once again on behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, in a referral motion moved on Monday, 14 May, the Minister outlined plans for the stage 1 redevelopment of the Oakey Army Aviation Centre, located 160 kilometres west of Brisbane, to be examined by the Public Works Committee. The centre was originally established in 1941 for use by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II but was taken over by the Army in 1969. Since then a number of developments have taken place, including provision of temporary and permanent facilities for units currently located on the base.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed works are aimed at rectifying significant occupational health and safety deficiencies and upgrading working conditions at the base. In line with this Government's commitment to enhancing defence capabilities, and as stressed in the Defence Policy Information Paper of 1987, there is a continued need for Army aviation assets and an extensive infrastructure of bases, airfields, training and other facilities to support the operations of the Australian defence forces. The centre at Oakey is a major part of that infrastructure, providing the core for both aviation training and support for the Army throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Public Works Committee in its report agreed that a need exists to overcome serious occupational health and safety deficiencies at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre and recognised the need to replace temporary buildings built in 1972. Furthermore, the Committee is satisfied that the proposed works will overcome the more serious occupational health and safety problems at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre.
      </para>
      <para>
       On behalf of the Minister, I am pleased at the support that this proposed redevelopment has received from the Opposition and I would like on his behalf to thank the Committee for its support for the proposal. I also commend this motion to the House. May I say in conclusion that the matters raised by my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) I will take on notice on behalf of the Minister. I will request that the Minister get back to her in relation to those matters in due course. In conclusion, I thank the House for its indulgence.

         â€”In the dying hours of the shortest sitting period of this Federal Parliament for 50 years we are being allowed to debate for under three hours one of the most critical pieces of legislation confronting our major industry, the wool industry. The Wool Tax Amendment Bills are of considerable importance at this critical time and need to be passed, but I must complain about the way the House is so shabbily treating this greatest of our industries, particularly with the deteriorating situation becoming so apparent day by day due to the Government's inept handling of the present crisis in the collapse of the auction system. There is a long list of speakers and most of them will not be able to participate in the debate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The wool industry is our greatest industry. It is our most efficient industry and our largest rural industry. Over a period it has been our largest export industry and, in spite of that large buying-in by the Wool Corporation this year, is still worth $4 billion. On a net basis, it is probably still our most significant export. As an industry it is most significant for Australia for research and promotion. The woolgrowers of this country in good times and bad have levied themselves $190m a year to make sure that wool is respected and accepted as a quality fibre throughout the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Wool Tax Acts are part of the greater wool legislation which was passed in 1987, of which the Wool Marketing Act was the major piece, setting the structure for this Bill. I wish to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones):
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Wool Corporation can on a financial transaction basis be equated with larger Australian private corporations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not appropriate in this regard for the Australian Wool Corporation to be hampered in its ability to operate commercially. It cannot be expected to seek frequently ministerial or government approvals for corporate financial decisions. It is also fundamentally wrong for major decisions on the finances and market operations of the Australian Wool Corporation, such as decisions on the minimum reserve price, to be taken in a political environment. If the Australian Wool Corporation is to act as an autonomous commercial body it must have its financial arrangements established, as far as possible, on a commercial basis like any other business organisation. The Bill introduces a number of changes to ensure this. It also establishes a proper relationship on financial matters between the Australian Wool Corporation, the Government and the Wool Council of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present the Minister for Primary Industry determines the market indicator floor price each year for the reserve price scheme. This is inconsistent with the Government's objectives of maximum commercial flexibility and autonomy. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the Corporation as the commercial operator to set and announce the minimum market indicator reserve price and the reserve prices for the various wool types, after agreement with the Wool Council on the minimum market indicator price. This arrangement recognises not only the commercial role of the Australian Wool Corporation but also the role of the Wool Council of Australia in representing the wool growers who provide the funds through a tax paid on the shorn value of wool sold.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the basis, the philosophy, for the establishment of the levy and the floor price. The Minister, enshrining in the 1987 legislation, said, `It is the industry responsibility'. However, he did say-it is part of the legislation and it is a necessary part of all statutory marketing legislation-that there are circumstances when the Minister, on behalf of the government, has to intervene. Under this legislation there are at least three ways in which the Minister can intervene, particularly in relation to determining the floor price. The first is when there is disagreement between the Australian Wool Council and the Corporation on the level of the floor price. The second is when the borrowing approval for the Corporation, for the market support fund, exceeds a certain limit. It now appears that that limit has been exceeded; I will come back to that later. The third is what are called exceptional circumstances or a national interest clause. Those are the formal ways in which the Minister as a last resort can intervene after taking into account what the present Minister has said is the way in which the industry, as a great and responsible industry, should be left to make those decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        But several Ministers have already intervened in an unprecedented way to interfere with the market. I refer to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). During the election campaign both I, on behalf of the Opposition, and Mr Kerin on behalf of the Government, gave written assurances to the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council to approve borrowing limits of $2 3/4 billion which would allow the then projected stockpile or buying-in requirements of the Corporation to be covered for the next wool selling season. Now, partly because of the deterioration in the market, but particularly because of the crisis that has been created in the industry by this inept intervention of these Ministers at this inappropriate time, another half a million bales of wool will almost certainly be bought in. Therefore there will be that requirement for further approval which the Treasurer has already indicated, if he has been reported correctly, may not be given. These unprecedented interventions are causing chaos in the industry at present. They are not related to the already serious situation the industry was facing. They are not related directly to the piece of legislation before us today dealing with the wool levy. But they are directly related to the campaign by the Government to lower the floor price. It is doing that when sales are in progress and ahead of industry decisions.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Levy Bills are very common pieces of legislation in this House. We have already had notice of one for the dried vine fruits industry which will double the maximum levy limit. Under that maximum level the industry determines what the operating level will be. It has always been regarded as important that there be a buffer or space between the two to allow for contingencies and also so that there is not this requirement for amendment legislation to be continually coming back to this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Due to the increased buying by the Australian Wool Corporation this financial year, or season; due to increased production with favourable seasons; due to the withdrawal temporarily of China from the market and of other countries who were buying for the Chinese market; due to warmer northern winters; and due to the move to lighter weight fabrics, those purchases have increased. So earlier this year both the Council and the Corporation recommended an increase to 15 per cent to cover that necessary further support. Since then, there has been more uncertainty concerning the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I am pleased to have heard statements of reassurance here today concerning that country's purchases because that country is our second largest buyer of wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        To cover the situation, the Wool Council recommended lifting the 10 per cent maximum to 25 per cent to give greater flexibility and, as I have mentioned before, greater grower equity in the fund. The Wool Corporation also recommended 25 per cent but made the further point that it can borrow better with that level and there may be a need to increase the the promotion levy to move more of the coarser wools which are not selling as well. Both made the point about having a good safe buffer between the operating level and the maximum levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has said that it will accept 20 per cent; that is the purpose of this Bill. On behalf of the Opposition, I can say that we will support the legislation and thus this figure of 20 per cent. But that does not mean that the Opposition supports anything beyond the levy. Any inference concerning the floor price is completely unfounded and incorrect because the philosophy that we adhere to, even if the Government does not, is that it is the industry's right and responsibility to determine that floor price.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are faced with the situation that Parliament is about to rise and the end of the season is approaching. The Wool Corporation is meeting tomorrow to make its decision or to start its decision-making process on what the recommendation for the floor price should be for next season. The Wool Council is meeting next Wednesday. It is important that they know what the Government, what the Parliament, will legislate for in terms of the wool levy. They have indicated that, although they would prefer 25 per cent, 20 per cent is acceptable and will not impede their decisions in relation to the floor price. If we look at the figures that have been provided by the Wool Council, there is little difference between the 20 per cent and 25 per cent levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a tax Bill; therefore, there are limitations on what can be done with regard to amending that figure of 20 per cent. Basically, the Opposition cannot amend that figure. I am not saying that we should or should not, but it is right that people should know that it cannot be amended as such. The only procedure that can be done would be for the passage of the legislation to be blocked-realistically, that is only in the Senate-until such time as the Government decided to redraft the Bill and bring in a different figure. But any such blocking or attempted blocking of this legislation would be devastating for the industry because it could mean that the industry would be left with a levy of only 10 per cent for several months. This would critically impede the ability of the Corporation with credit ratings and borrowings and dramatically reduce grower equity. Any attempt by anyone in the Senate to block this legislation should be condemned because that would be contrary to the wishes of the industry and the necessary approvals that the industry needs at this moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I come back to the points about criticism, the problems of the industry and how this Government has very much added to the problems of this great industry. First of all, it has done that with its interest rate policy, with record high interest rates which have brought with them an overvalued dollar, which in turn has created hesitancy in the market in relation to purchases by wool buyers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, this interest rate policy has resulted in greater cost to growers in maintaining the stockpile. We have been told that a bale of wool, after being held in a stockpile for four years, will completely lose its value. Associated with that, inflation is twice that of our competitors, adding to the costs to growers, and we have a continually inefficient transport and waterfront sector, which adds once again to the costs of this great industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of that we now have, because of this inept intervention by a range of Ministers, a crisis in the wool industry quite separate from and additional to the already serious situation. I do not disagree with the legislation and the right of a government and a Minister to intervene-that has to be there-but there is a right time and a right way for that intervention. To have created this unnecessary uncertainty in an already insensitive market is terribly inept. That is why 75 per cent of the offerings have had to be bought in in the last couple of days by the Wool Corporation-over two times the average buying-in level of recent markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Minister and the Government believe they must intervene for the reasons I stated earlier, there is time to do so after the conclusion of the wool selling season and before the commencement of the next season. Wool buyers, brokers and growers are bombarding us at the present time, thus there is a terrible dilemma in the industry and the market. The industry is saying, ahead of those meetings which I have referred to, that the current floor price is its preferred position. The market has a perception, because of the statements by Ministers, that the Government will intervene and lower the floor price; hence, this massive buying-in. That will mean several hundred thousand bales unnecessarily added to the stockpile, a loss of millions and millions of dollars in exports and additional and unnecessary costs to the growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal legislation, the Wool Marketing Act, prevents any immediate resolution of this dilemma. The reserve price can be changed only once in the financial year, at the beginning of the financial year. It cannot be done at any other time without further amendments to the major piece of legislation, the Wool Marketing Act. The calls that have been coming from the industry have, by far, overtaken any criticism with regard to the level of the levy. That is bypassed now. The industry call is that, if the Government is to intervene-and the market is indicating it believes that to be the case-it wants the Minister to resolve this chaos and this dilemma that the inept way in which the Government is moving is causing the industry. It is possible for the Government to do that. On behalf of those people who have rung in, I put it to the Government that it must consider the situation seriously. We have at this very time in the market a chaos which is not necessary, which is adding to the already great problems of the industry and which the industry itself did not cause.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, the Opposition supports the legislation. We believe it should have a speedy passage through both Houses of Parliament so that the industry can know, ahead of those meetings, the decision of this Parliament. There is a request, if possible, to accelerate the debate and the passage of this Bill in the Senate. That would be helpful to the overall cause of the industry at the present time. If the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is sitting at the table, could take that to his Senate colleagues, it would be appreciated.

         â€”The Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills seek to increase the maximum rate of wool tax from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The minimum rate of wool tax that may be imposed remains at 5.25 per cent. There is no doubt that the wool industry faces a great challenge today and is at the crossroads. In Roma in the next few days and weeks it has to look at the proposition of the floor price of wool. Prices peaked in 1988 at 1,250c or thereabouts and they have come down to around 800c today.

        One of the problems that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) touched on was the fact that Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) stocks now stand at 2.5 million bales. The AWC has used the $1.8m reserve of woolgrowers' funds and has borrowed additional funds that will amount to approximately $1 billion at the end of the season. On present indications, the prospects are that in 12 months' time wool stocks will stand at approximately 4.4 million bales and the debt will be $2.2 billion, increasing at an alarming rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this debate so far in the community there has been a reluctance on the part of the National Party of Australia to show any leadership or any vision. The honourable member for Murray basically said that it was up to the growers to set their own price. That is true. But politicians in all political parties are expected to show some leadership and to have a bit of courage. In the bush I have seen that the Nationals are very good at saying to farmers what they want to hear but not good at saying it the way it is. The reality is that the price of wool, at 870c per kilogram, is too high.
       </para>
       <para>
        Daily we hear the new dries and the right of the Liberal Party of Australia saying, `Let us have a bit of market forces; let us embrace market forces'. At the same time we have the National Party, the agrarian socialists, saying, `Let us put our heads in the sand and walk away; pretend the problem does not exist; blame everybody else. Let us leave it to the industry to tell us what we should say'. In other words, they say, `If we see a team running out to the right, we will get in front of it and hope it is running in the right direction'.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has not been any leadership on the part of the National Party and it is quite obvious that the Liberal Party is controlling the rural debate and the conservative side of politics today. I am very pleased to see that the Liberals will support us in this regard. I do not know whether any Queensland Nationals will cross the floor and keep well in with Sir Robert Sparkes or whether they will follow the line, begrudgingly; but the fact is that the wool price is too high and has to come down. The reason it has to come down is that demand has dropped. The biggest threat to the wool industry is that the competitors of wool, the synthetics and the mixtures, will gain access to the market if they sell at a lower price. Once industries lose access to the market they find it very hard to regain that market share.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess that some leaders in the wool industry have been happy to set the price at 870c. They have to tell the growers that they made a mistake, in retrospect. At the time it was not necessarily a mistake but it is now in retrospect. They ought to be big enough to say that they made a blue and that the price has to come down for the welfare of all in the industry, not just their own egos. As I have said, it is interesting that the National Party is trying to blame the Government for the fact that world demand has dropped because of the problems in Europe and Japan.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was interesting, too, to hear the honourable member for Murray touch on the high exchange rate. Who was it that floated the dollar? For 40 years rural Australia was affected by a high exchange rate, high protection and high tariffs. It was McEwenism, the tariff monkey on the back of farmers that the National Party endorsed, which held back agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is regarded as the most respected person in the industry is that he says it the way it is. It takes a bit of courage to stand up and say what is needed to be said in this debate. As I have said and will say again, the price has to come down. It is not a reality. It is common sense. In four years at the present rate, interest would wipe out the total value of the stocks of wool. There is no-one in any grade six mathematics course that would embark in that direction. Yet we have had in this debate many people putting the proposition that there should be no leadership at all. We would be wrong and irresponsible if we did not show leadership. If that cops a bit of flack here and there, so what? It is all about leading this nation, not sitting back and trying to win popularity contests at the expense of agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similar schemes to the present scheme and a high floor price-I would like to make this comparison-as has been promoted by some people in the industry and on the other side of politics, have been tried. I refer to the International Tin Agreement. Some members may not be aware of what happened. The ITA operated with a series of five-year agreements from 1956 to 1985. In the face of falling demand, large production and large stockholdings, the ITA collapsed in 1985. Its funds and credit were exhausted in an attempt to maintain a floor price which was far too high relative to the price on the prevailing market. And that is the very reality of maintaining 870c a kilo today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to point out that given Australia's size in the rural wool market decisions regarding the reserve price scheme will have impacts on world wool supply and demand. The policy of maintaining a high floor price which is supported by the wool tax, either immediately or through repayment of borrowings, will have the effect of dampening growth in wool demand and encouraging increased wool supply by overseas producers. In other words, Australian woolgrowers would be in effect supporting overseas woolgrowers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other reason why I believe it is important to lower the price and to accept reality is that growers would get more liquidity; the more stocks that are cleared the quicker we can clear the stockpile, because it is the small to medium farmers that will be at most risk. While there will be pain regardless of what decision is taken, if the tax levy went to 25 per cent and if the floor price is maintained we would simply be pricing ourselves out of existing markets or future markets at present and handing that over to our competitors. All that will do is force more people that can maintain their viability to the wall.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that there is a guillotine on this Bill and I will not take up the full 20 minutes, but I would like to reiterate the fact that it has been interesting to note that in the wool debate up to now, in the wheat debate and in the sugar debate, when it came to tough economic decisions it was the National Party every time that wimped out. Now we have a new National Party Leader, and the press releases are still hot off the press saying, `A new direction-we're going to go back to the bush; we are going to go back to our own constituency'. The first hurdle National Party members come to, they squib; they will not jump the hurdle. What they have done is run around and run back to the saddling paddock. Of course, the hurdle is the problem in the wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the wheat debate, again it was the National Party that baulked and squibbed there. It was Sir Robert Sparkes who ran the show in the National Party, and of course there were comments such as `50,000 trucks going through the main street of Brisbane'. None of us have seen 50,000 trucks going through the main street of Brisbane. Then it came to the sugar debate, and the deregulation there and the abolition of the sugar embargo. Again we had the National Party saying that was going to be the end of the industry. Sugar prices are better now than they have ever been. We have had a win at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since then and we will get bigger access to the United States market.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has happened of course is that honourable members like the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who has some understanding of agriculture-I do not believe in his politics, but he has some understanding of agriculture-has had to drag the National Party screaming to these decisions. I can understand the factional differences that the members have. But the first time they face a hurdle under their new leadership, they baulk and they cannot muster.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is interesting that-and I know it is only a coincidence-the Wool Council is going to meet in Roma, the home of Sir Robert Sparkes, and it will be there that Sir Robert Sparkes will give riding instructions to the Federal members of the National Party on what to do with regard to wool and what to say. But it will be too late, because everyone else will know what is happening, bar the Nationals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Australian Democrats will be a bigger dominant force as a minority party in politics in another three years than the National Party. In the last 12 months, when three of the largest and most important industries in Australian agriculture, wool, wheat and sugar have been threatened, each time the Nationals baulk and run away; each time they have to stand up and make a tough decision and tell it the way it is, they run away. What do they say? `Let the woolgrowers tell us what we ought to say; let them write our policy'. That is not what politics is about. That is not the way it is done. I believe what they really have done is to hand agriculture and the conservative side of politics over to the Liberals. It is no coincidence today that the Labor Party holds more rural seats than the Nationals.

         â€”The Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills have the effect of increasing the maximum rate of wool tax from 10 to 20 per cent. It is the coalition's decision to support the 20 per cent tax based on a number of factors, but first I think it is worth saying one or two things. Firstly, this has been a very difficult debate. It has been a very difficult decision for all sorts of people, including those in the industry. It is a very serious situation and I think it important that we approach this matter on as bipartisan a basis as possible.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think it is worth saying that the Wool Council of Australia, which represents the growers and of which I had the honour of being President some time ago, at only the executive meeting before last issued a press statement. That statement said that a detailed analysis of the current wool marketing situation and forecasts for the balance of this season, 1989-90, and the 1990-91 season confirm that a 15 per cent wool tax was adequate to meet the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) financing requirements to maintain the floor price of 870c clean. It also resolved at that meeting from which the announcement came that this 15 per cent ceiling be reviewed at the November 1990 policy conference. So not long ago-just several months-the Wool Council had a 15 per cent levy in mind. It fleetingly moved to support a 20 per cent and ultimately, in the last few weeks, a 25 per cent tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        I raise this subject only to show how difficult and mobile this debate has been over the last few months and to emphasise the fact that it is not always easy to know exactly whether one is right or not in a debate that is moving as fast as this.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a great number of complexities of the possibilities facing the industry. There is doubt about supply. There is doubt about the purchasing power of the eastern Europeans and the Russians-China seems to be out of the market but is perhaps about to come back-among other things. It has been a complicated debate and, therefore, the position is difficult.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the reasons why the coalition has come down for a 20 per cent tax are several in the main. In all the simulations that we have been shown and in all the possibilities that we have seen by the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and everyone else, there does not seem to be a great difference in the additional interest that will be required to finance the floor at 870c between a 20 or a 25 per cent tax when one relates that interest to the total borrowings of the Corporation and that is, of course, in any one year. In the first year-the 1990-91 year-it looks as though the maximum added interest that the Corporation will need to provide is about $40m to $50m a year, at 20 per cent. If that tax were 25 per cent, then that $50m would be paid by the growers either in additional borrowings by those growers or in interest forgone. I think that is a very important thing to realise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second factor that was mentioned earlier by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) is that if we had taken the 25 per cent tax debate in the Senate and won it, there was a possibility of going into the next purchasing season with a maximum tax of 10 per cent because the House of Representatives is at this stage not due to sit until 21 August. The possibility of having that impediment hanging over the wool industry was untenable, so we did not take that decision. Putting those two factors together-the fact that the Corporation will not really have a much greater interest bill to pay at 20 per cent when it is related to the $2 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion of debt, and the fact that it was untenable that we should face the possibility of going into the July and early August sales with a 10 per cent tax-then the decision became quite obvious. It seems to me that, having made it, out there on the grass people have become more relaxed on that subject and are starting to face the real decision coming up, which is the decision about the reserve price.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does raise several problems, and I think that one of the greatest problems about this debate for us in this House has been the lack of information. It is quite understandable that there should be a lack of information because in some respects the wool industry is in the same parlous situation that the Treasurer of a country would be in with a fixed exchange rate. He almost has to not think about it; he certainly cannot talk about it until the moment that he makes a decision to change it. The same thing applies in the wool industry when there is a reserve price and people are buying. One really cannot publicly contemplate any lowering of that price or any major change of arrangements until the end of the time for which those arrangements have been made. I think that has been very difficult. It has been difficult here, but it has been much more difficult for the industry. There are thousands of growers out there today who have not the slightest idea what the figures show because they have not seen them. It is understandable, but it makes it very difficult for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition, in reaching its conclusion took note of various propositions and simulations. They were available to us of late days. We notice in some of them that it was possible that we could have a peak debt of $4 billion under certain possibilities. We noticed in some of those simulations-and one has to look at these things because they are the best workings of the people who have the best chance of knowing what the possibilities are-a peak stockpile of between three and seven million bales of wool. When we looked at those figures, it brought home the point very strongly that the current cost of storing a bale of wool is approximately $220. That is made up of about $180 in interest, depending on how well the Corporation manages to borrow, and $40 in storage. So for every million bales we will be paying out around $170m to $190m in interest. It is either interest that one pays out to an outsider or, if that money comes from the wool tax, it is interest forgone by the growers. When one gets to five, six or even seven million bales, not only is one able to build a ski resort into the sky with the pyramid of bales, but one has an unbelievable amount of dead interest going out to other lenders.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also came home to us very strongly that the value of a bale of wool dissipated totally within four years at these interest rates, and that is without adding compounded inflation rates. As I have said, I would like to keep this debate reasonably bipartisan. But it is true to say that, if our current interest rates were 9 per cent instead of 18 per cent, 10 per cent instead of 20 or 8 per cent instead of 16, that borrowing requirement would stay the same but the interest to be paid would come down enormously. Of course, when interest rates are held up, the dollar is also held up, so the gun is doubly loaded to the extent that one is paying out much higher interest than would otherwise be the case and, because our dollar is higher, buyers from the other end of the world are not able to buy our wool at the same price.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be a sad thing if we have a stockpile of five million bales, but quite a number of the simulations show that it is quite possible that at the end of June 1995 we could have between four million and six million bales in the stockpile. As we have never sold today's current production clip, which is about five million bales in any one year-I think I am correct in saying that-that is, we have not had a disappearance of wool out of either the stockpile or from the day-to-day auctions of five million bales of wool, that will mean that it is possible under some of those simulations to have two wool clips in Australia. If that were to be the case at the end of June 1995, it would most certainly mean that some of the wool that we have in the stockpile today would still be in the stockpile in the year 2000. That is rather a salutary point.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of general points I would like to make about the wool industry which I think people sometimes forget. First, in the whole history of wool selling in this country back into the early part of the nineteenth century, we have never had extremely high prices for wool for more than a season and a half-not ever, not even when we had three American companies bidding against each other to provide wool for the American Army in the Korean War. There has never been a single exception to this fact. That is something that many woolgrowers do not know. It is something that we should remember. It is certainly something that I think we forgot in the euphoria of 1987, 1988 and 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to take us back just briefly to the formation of the reserve price which evolved over a number of years. Initially, provision was made in the early 1970s for only a flexible reserve-one that followed the market up and down on a daily or weekly basis. The early legislation did not make provision for what we now call the reserve price or the floor price until 1974. The basis of the floor price was a price below which we would not sell our commodity to the world. It was based on a number of premises. It was a price which was to give predictability to the growers, a price which they could depend on-maybe not a profitable one but at least it was known. Secondly, it was a price which was to give some predictability to the buyer. Of course, that varies from country to country because a predictable price in Australian dollars may not be so predictable in French francs or deutschmarks as those currencies move against our own.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later, in the early 1980s, when we were looking at a sheep flock of just over 130 million-a low number in reasonably recent historical terms-and when we were thinking about setting floor prices, an ingredient was added and was heavily discussed within the Wool Council and the industry and that was that the floor price should not be so low that it affected the structure and size of the sheep flock. We believed that 130 million was on the low side, and it had got there for good reason-because, over previous years, the price was low. Of course, we had a fairly useful drought on the eastern seaboard in 1982. But we regarded the thought process of setting the reserve price as important in regard to what effect it might have on the national flock. As I said, it was discussed many times and it was not a price that was supposed to be directly related to the cost of production but, in an indirect sense and in the sense I have just discussed, of course it was.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think there are a number of reasons for our current surplus and I believe that, in the main, they are probably five-fold. As I said before, firstly, we have to remember that we have never had a disappear-ance, as the term goes, of wool in any one year that is the equivalent of this year's wool clip. In the normal way we would actually be adding slightly to our stockpile, even if we had sold any previous year's record amount.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the age-old move from wheat to an alternative product has been around during the 1980s when the wheat industry found international prices totally unsatisfactory. Thirdly, we have had a run of extremely good seasons in Australia, and in New South Wales in particular, which of course is the engine-room of quantity wool growing in Australia-many of the New South Welshmen would believe of ultimate quality as well. But when New South Wales is good, we certainly produce an enormous amount of wool. Fourthly, I believe we have had a reserve price which, as it turns out over the past two or three years, has been too high; it has been above the long-term trend line. Fifthly, as I mentioned before, China, Russia and eastern Europe have been in a doubtful state from the point of view of purchasing our wool and, of recent times, it seems there is some doubt about their ability to pay for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        To the extent that the reserve price has been too high, then it seems to me that it has encouraged some people to make positive decisions about the size of their sheep flock. If all these things are put together, then we have the current situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making these comments I am not in any respect trying to lay blame, for the blame could easily be laid at the feet of all of us-grower, Wool Council, the Corporation, Government, Minister, or any of us who did not speak up earlier. I must say that, in making these comments, I am not taking any position on the reserve price decision that is to be made this week or next. That is properly a decision for the industry to make. I realise that it is a most difficult decision-probably the most difficult decision that has been made by the wool industry since it finally and, fortunately, in these circumstances, decided not to acquire the Australian wool clip in the early 1980s. I make the comments because I believe that, after this impasse is over and we have worked our way out of it, we should be able to look back and remember that history quite often repeats itself and there are some things to be learned from all traumas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, as the financial differentials were not all that important-between 20 and 25 per cent-I want to reiterate the point that, whether or not this House were to sit again in a fortnight, whether or not a decision for 25 per cent in the Senate would have forced the Government to sit again, the possibility of sending the Corporation into the next season to start in July without the ability to underpin whatever reserve price is to be chosen by not raising the levy from 10 per cent to much more than 10, could not be contemplated.
       </para>
       <para>
        With these two things in mind the coalition made a decision which I believe was a strong decision. It was a sensible decision. It was a decision which has not taken any purchasing power away from the Corporation. It is a decision which will enable various bodies, the Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia at the end of this week and through next week to make decisions for the industry into the future which, I hope, will stand us in very good stead. I hope that out of this we can learn the lessons from the past. I hope that the industry, great as it is, will survive yet another one of its occasional traumas, and I look forward this week and next week to the decisions the industry will make.

         â€”I congratulate the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) on his sober and very well argued exposition of the position of the wool industry in this country. He is an acknowledged expert in this area. My only disappointment is that he did not venture a position on the reserve price, because it would have been of great interest to us to get his view on what would be an appropriate reserve price, given that the Opposition is supporting the 20 per cent rate.

         â€”All I am saying is that I would have been interested in his view. I acknowledge his expertise and the quality of his contribution here today. The position that the wool industry finds itself in is, as he suggested, due to a large number of factors, principally a considerable fall in demand overseas. In China and the Soviet Union there have been significant changes that affect their ability and desire to access our wool. There have been a number of warm winters in the northern hemisphere, which has affected demand. There is concern about increasing subsidisation of sales from South Africa and a number of other issues that are related to demand.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In this country we have had a number of good production seasons and, as a result of that, an increase in broad fibres, which is the most vulnerable area of the market. We have much larger flocks as a result and considerable substitution occurring within the industry. People who were previously involved in wheat farming have taken up producing wool because of the outstanding possibilities of the price and a number of factors. Even the most recent floods, which many perhaps thought might affect wool production, will probably in the long term mean that at least the status quo is preserved and may result in even better pastures and more wool production.
       </para>
       <para>
        For all those reasons, we find ourselves with decreasing demand and significant production. Those two things lead to an inconsistency and difficulties with stockpiles. The issue that we are very much concerned about is the effect this will have on returns for growers. The floor price and the tax options are seminal to considering that. The scenarios that have been developed by those who are in the best position to produce statistics and to speculate as to the direction indicate that we are looking at about 2 3/4 million bales stockpiled by the end of June this year and borrowings by the Australian Wool Corporation of more than $1 billion. If the price is held and we continue with the demand and production predictions, we are looking at about 4.8 million bales next year and over six million bales the year after in the stockpile. That represents grave difficulties and, as has already been suggested, more than a complete year's wool clip on the market to be sold and terrible problems for the Wool Corporation in servicing those very large debts.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the Wool Corporation needs to understand that times have changed. This marketing strategy, this floor price structure, was developed at a time when we had a managed exchange rate. The commodity markets were much less sophisticated in their hedging activities than they are today. It is important for us to consider that, because previously devaluation of the Australian dollar could be engineered and the position and the price of wool for overseas markets was able to be varied in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not have that possibility now. Even with falling interest rates and the Government selling Australian dollars, we find that we do not have a devaluation of our dollar and so that structure is not available any more. The danger is that these very large projected stockpiles will dampen the industry for many years to come. The Government does not find it an easy decision to make, but the point that has already been mentioned is that only a few months ago it was believed that a 15 per cent tax would be sufficient to fund the borrowings of the Corporation. We find that escalating to 20 per cent, and now 25 per cent is the asked for figure. It is the case that the growers will soon be their own best customers. A massive international storehouse in Australia, Australian growers buying most of their own wool and a product which is not competitive internationally would stress to us that we would be in a very parlous situation. Such a policy really does not make any sense. It is important for us to consider those aspects.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must state that I do have an interest. My brother is a woolgrower in the south-west of Western Australia. He is a member of the National Party, much to the chagrin of the family. I spoke with him today because he is very concerned about this issue. I think that he is facing very difficult circumstances himself. He is not a large farmer, but he accepts that the wool industry is damned if it does, and it is damned if it does not. It is a case of the Government taking the option which we believe provides the best prospect for the future or the long and medium term recovery of the industry. Therefore, we have looked at all of the scenarios produced by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) and the Australian Wool Corporation, and taken into account reserve price scenarios, the resulting stockholdings, the borrowing requirements of the Australian Wool Corporation, the debt equity outcomes that will result from the various scenarios, the marketing strategies which are envisaged and the research and development which is presently taking place. All of those things will take time, and it is necessary for us in this position to make a more immediate response. The speed with which this present situation has developed, I believe, is the most frightening aspect of the whole issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are concerned about the long-term viability of the industry. We are absolutely committed to the fact that it is not appropriate for the Government to use its statutory powers under which growers have no choice but to pay the levy. The Government has to be very careful in this position. Given all those considerations, the decreases in demand, the increase in production and the costs of handling and storage, we have taken the position that the appropriate level for this tax to be struck at is 20 per cent. Given that position I believe that it is not a logical thing to hold the reserve price at its present level. By holding the reserve price at its present level we allow countries producing overseas, in particular New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina and Uruguay, to continue to undercut our price.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time, we are saying that we do not believe the market is price sensitive. When those on the other side preach the market economy, it does not make any sense at all. If we endeavour to maintain the price at that high level there is an effect on production in this country. Indeed, it is necessary for there to be an appropriate production response.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other major concern is that if we continue to maintain the price it will be an incentive for those overseas to substitute other materials for wool. That consideration is very important. It is already a worry in Japan that substitution of synthetic fibres is occurring. If we endeavour to maintain an unrealistic price we have to consider that. It is our view that that reserve price needs to fall. The more rapid recovery of the market will occur as a result of doing that. I will quote the final paragraph of the summary of a document from the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics:
       </para>
       <para>
        By far the greatest risks faced by the industry are associated with not reducing the floor price. By maintaining the floor at 870c/kg with a tax of 25 per cent (as has recently been suggested), and given the losses that this implies, the industry would be sending a clear signal to world markets that it believes that wool is really worth much less than 870c/kg. However, overseas producers would continue to be supported by the Australian industry and Australian growers would fail to benefit from the increase in consumption that would be stimulated by a reduction in the floor price.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not a decision that the Government has made easily or with any relish. There is and can be no victor in this position. But a decision must be made. It is appropriate that we respond as decisively as possible. The scenario mapped out offers the best medium to long term solution for the industry. The extent and the speed of the development of this present situation and the sluggishness with which there has been a response is frightening. It is not a circumstance which we will be able to tough out.
       </para>
       <para>
        There needs to be a significant market response by the industry. I hope that it takes that position. It is not even a philosophical argument. If it were, we would expect support for a much lower price than that which ABARE is suggesting; it is an empirical judgment we need to make on the best evidence available. Given that, it is necessary for us to make a decision. I hope that in the ensuing weeks the Wool Council of Australia and the Corporation will consider these issues very clearly. Perhaps the information will change even in the next month, as the honourable member for Barker suggested. But it is clear that there is no winner and no easy way out of this problem. We believe that the decision that we have made here and which is entailed in the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills is the best chance for the industry.

         â€”The debate tonight on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990 is about whether we raise the wool tax from 10 per cent, of which presently 8 per cent is utilised, to 20 per cent as a maximum figure. It is, of course, up to the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and the Wool Council of Australia to determine, in consultation, what percentage of that maximum level they wish to use and also, let us not forget, the floor price, which stands at present at 870c.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very sad that we are tonight debating this matter when the industry is in such a parlous state. It has been Australia's greatest industry; we have indeed ridden on the sheep's back. The industry is still Australia's greatest industry, and it will continue to be Australia's greatest industry for the foreseeable future. Only a year or two ago it was bringing $500m a month into this country from sales. Regrettably, that has now fallen to less than $300m a month, on average. Of course, that is impacting greatly on our economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why have we got to the situation that we are in today? I believe that the blame lies in many quarters. I think the Government carries a fair burden of that blame, particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating) who has run an insane one-dimensional high interest rate policy in this country which, just in this particular instance, has added enormously to woolgrowers' costs through having to meet interest payments on borrowings as well as helping to force up the price of everything they use. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) mentioned in his speech, $180 of the $220 annual cost of storing a bale of wool in the stockpile is due to interest alone because of the record interest rates that this country is presently burdened with.
       </para>
       <para>
        Money is being sucked into the country chasing these high interest rates and, as a result, the exchange rate is much higher than it would otherwise be. Of course, that impacts on this industry because it makes it so much harder to sell our wool, particularly at a proper price. I believe that, as well as these vital factors, the Government is also at fault for the loose talk that has gone about in recent days which has sabotaged the markets in this country this week.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as this, I believe blame also lies fairly and squarely with both the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation. Quite frankly, I am starting to doubt the competence of those who sit on these bodies. They have kept the growers totally uninformed, if not misinformed. In some cases they have fed out information that is the reverse of what the situation actually is and encouraged us all to live in a fool's paradise where euphoria has been praised. Those who have questioned the developing situation that has been building up in this country have been condemned and hounded as doomsayers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think a measure of this incompetence has been reflected in the degree of lobbying, which has been almost non-existent, in the lead-up to the debate on this Bill. I am a back bench member of Parliament with probably as much wool production in my electorate as any other in Australia but I have not yet received a note across my desk from the Wool Council or the Wool Corporation.

         â€”Not one note, as the honourable member for Mallee confirms. We even had to invite a member of the Wool Council along to brief us. This compares with the Carpet Institute of Australia which sent us a very well argued case that I think won the hearts of most people on both sides of this chamber. I want to cite a couple of examples of the fairyland situation that these bodies have been in. I turn to the AWC annual report for 1987-88, back when the job was good. On page 14 it says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Record prices and record production in the same year were the highlights of the wool industry's successes but these achievements were by no means coincidental. They were the results of years of commitment by wool growers, the judg- ment and leadership of their representatives on the Wool Council of Australia and the contribution of the management expertise of the AWC.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is true, and they are claiming credit for the high prices, no doubt they will be rushing in to accept some of the blame for the state we find ourselves in today. It was with interest that I turned to pages 14 and 15 of the Corporation's report for the following year. This was when wool had come off the top and finished the seas at 893cs, an enormous plunge of the order of 30 per cent. Yet the annual report says:

       <para>
        . . . wool is still in sound demand. . .

       <para>
        Then further down-this is the daddy of them all-it says:

       </para>
       <para>
        . . . consumer demand for the product is strong and widespread . . . We are now entering a period of consolidation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It concludes:
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to pay tribute to all the AWC staff whose hard work, dedication and loyalty to Australian woolgrowers have made a major contribution to the success of the wool industry that we see today. I am sure the growers appreciate this.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure indeed. The farm organisations are hardly in a better position. They have sent little or nothing to us, either, on this matter. I believe that the way they have approached this debate is totally unprofessional. On top of all this we have had the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia setting the wrong floor price, against I believe all the technical advice, at 870c, when the long-term trend was probably substantially less than 700c a kilogram.
       </para>
       <para>
        The original reasons for the floor price were touched on by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). I think it is worth reiterating some of those reasons, because the Corporation and honourable members on both sides of this House have lost sight of these, to their shame in some ways. Originally the floor price was put there for stability, predictability and for a smoothing of the price mechanism which it was hoped would advantage buyers, and that would flow on to growers. In effect, it was also a type of disaster insurance. But with any type of insurance there is a cost, and the cost was a slightly lower price for the product to smooth out the price variability that is passed on to the grower. We have lost sight of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was not put there to get more income for the growers, in that direct sense. It was not put there as a mechanism to compensate growers for their costs and to allow them profit margins above that, as desirable as that may be. It was not put there as an incentive to produce more wool. It certainly was not put there to buck the long-term market trends-because we know through the history of marketing in the world that that cannot be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 870c came about after six years of rises in the floor price, averaging 6.5 per cent per year, followed in the last two years by rises averaging 35.5 per cent for each year. I stress that that is the average. On top of that, we have a high supply situation. We have had an increase in supply in this country of 50 per cent on the 1982-83 levels. We had China coming in to buy our wool, and that was fortuitous, and then we had a devaluation of the order of 25 per cent or 30 per cent. It is worth mentioning this, because until 1983 the dollar had been fixed. After that, the dollar was floated, and collapsed. I think people have forgotten that when the dollar floats it is impossible to have stability for both the grower and the buyer. It just cannot be done. In this regard it would be more logical to set the floor in United States dollars, if that is what people want to achieve.
       </para>
       <para>
        The people who set the floor price also ignored the ratio of the price of wool to the price of the alternative products, particularly synthetics, which blew out from three to one, to in excess of eight to one. People ran into the same problems that we have seen in recent decades with the tin cartel fixing, with oil pricing and with coffee pricing-and the story goes on. Australia produces less than one third of the world's wool. Even the de Beers diamond cartel, which has probably been the most successful in the world's history, had a much greater grasp of a monopoly position than that. Of course, the Australian Wool Corporation was egged on by certain growers and farm organisations, which said that it should chase the exchange rate up and chase high prices above the long-term trends. They forgot that in chasing an exchange rate up it was only logical that it should then be chased down. Of course, it should not be chased up in the first place.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the floor price first came in in the early 1970s it had considerable success. That was the case for more than a decade. Because the original principles for which the floor price was put in place were followed, a false sense of security was built up in this country. Even more than that, it built up a slackness of analysis of how the floor price should be set.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the end I believe the floor was set more by intuition than by hard, substantive, critical analysis. I think that only highlights the need for independent advice, because the people who sit on these boards are only human beings. We became, in effect, price makers rather than price takers, and that has been our undoing. We should always have had a conservative and sustainable floor, and if we wanted to start chasing prices up it could have been done through flexible intervention pricing. This would have allowed us to chase the price up and, at the same time, to chase the price down without interfering with a sustainable floor.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the House that the situation and the circumstances in financial markets in the world have changed so much since the early 1970s when the floor price was first brought in. We have things like the fluctuating interest rates that I have talked about, futures contracts, the availability of hedging and so on. Floor prices, certainly as they are managed now, have become somewhat archaic. In many respects they mute the ability of the talented producers especially to manage their own affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        If nothing else, the reserve price scheme, after this episode is over, needs to be looked at again and revamped. Some of the things which could be looked at as well include rejigging the various levels of the market indicators. I am talking about the floor price that is put in place for the different micron counts: the equity of having it struck on price per kilogram rather than price per volume, or some combination of that; the equity of having carpet wool producers who produce in excess of 32 micron wool having to pay into the scheme; and the inequity of having the superfine producers who sell their product easily-there is a shortage of it in the world-being penalised in this way. We need to look at how it operates, from whom the information is got and how it should operate. I stress that in many ways it is outdated, and we must move with the times. The way the AWC has operated in recent years, it would not surprise me if its members turned up to the board meetings each in a horse and sulky with blinkers on the drivers instead of the horses.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have arrived at a situation in this country where an 870c level is too high-way above the long-term trend; where we are losing our market share and, let us not forget, we have got only about 4 per cent of the world fibre market. We are subsidising overseas growers, and even though we produce the bulk of the world's quality wool, we produce only a third of the total wool. We are buying back half our wool. We have borrowed to the hilt-we have spent the $1.8 billion nest egg we had-and we have borrowed in excess of another billion dollars. We are only starting and we have this massive oversupply situation caused by the factors that I have talked about.

        What should we do, given that we are in that situation? I ask that bearing in mind that legally only a Minister may move an amendment to a tax Bill.

         â€”The main options that I talked about-and I use AWC figures-are the 20 per cent tax option, the 25 per cent tax option and the 20/20 option, which is a 20 per cent tax and a 20 per cent drop in floor price to 700c. Whichever way we go we will be in a parlous situation. The 20 per cent tax option gives six million bales in two years and it only reduces to 5.4 million four years down the track, with external borrowings $8m over the legal borrowing limit, which comes out at $3.3 billion and a wool tax still close to 20 per cent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The 25 per cent tax option, because it only collects another $200 to $250m, gives virtually the same result-only about 200,000 bales better off four years down the track, with external borrowings still over the legal limit and the wool tax high.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 20/20 option, which is not for us to decide tonight, of course, would lift the present stockpile at the end of next month from 2.8 million bales to 3.8 million falling to two million-less than what we have now-in four years time, borrowings reducing to zero and the wool tax halved down to 10 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, if one were making a business decision one would chose the third option. The first two options alarm me because we are almost mortgaging our children's future. We are going to have a five million or six million bale overhang with borrowings like that if something does not turn up in the meantime. I acknowledge that something could turn up, but equally let us not forget that something could turn down. That is the more likely event the way the job looks overseas and the way things are in Russia, eastern Europe and other countries. It will be some considerable time down the track before they come good. We will have over hanging on the market a stultifying effect which could last us into the beginning of the next century. Those options do not excite me at all. I have stressed that there is very little difference between the 20 per cent option and the 25 per cent option. For that reason I am happy to support the Minister's proposition in the Bills here tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I conclude I would like to touch quickly on a few myths and arguments regarding the floor price and wool tax that have been raised with me by a number of constituents. Some say that if we devalue the floor price-which is not in the legislation tonight-we devalue the stockpile. That is quite true; we do. However, we also devalue the money we have to shell out in future to buy these extra bales of wool, if we go to hold on a 20 per cent. If we are going to go up to six million bales, that is another 3.2 million bales we have to buy. The figure of 3.2 was bigger than 2.8 when I went to school. Therefore, what we lose on the swings we more than make up on the roundabout.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some say it is unfair to overseas buyers because some will have bought in at the higher price and if we devalue the floor price those people will have an advantage. Strangely enough, we did not have this concern when the price collapsed by 30 per cent over the last year or two. But this argument conjures up an image in my mind that there might be 100 buyers out there, 50 who have bought their supplies and another 50 who are about to buy theirs. But that is not the way the world works. On average, of the 100-odd buyers or whatever there are in the world, they are all in roughly the same position. They have bought some of their wool and they are going to buy some of their wool later on. Obviously, there will be individual exceptions. That is the case as I see it, and I do not think that the argument holds great validity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Corporation has to decide, and decide quickly, whether it holds the floor or whether it lowers it. If it lowers it, the thing it has to take most into account is the terrible emotional attachment wool growers in this country have to their product and to that floor price. It has to make a very difficult decision. I have criticised it here tonight but I sympathise with it on that decision. We have got ourselves into a mess and we are all at least partly to blame for it. I wish it well and I trust, as I am sure all of us do, that the wool industry is descended upon by the Micawber effect and we get out of this position and go on to future prosperity as we have in the past with Australians greatest industry.

         â€”Like the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), I have a brother who produces wool but I see this as no reason why I should declare an interest. I declare an interest because I think every single person in Australia has an interest in the future of the wool industry in this country. In my view, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has done the very best under very difficult circumstances. Whilst I have not always agreed with some of the Minister's stances in the past, in this instance I take my hat off to him. He has done a tremendous job and I am pleased that he is the Minister in charge of this matter, and not, perhaps, some other people.

        I did listen with attention to the speech from the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). I thought that it was a very reasoned speech-almost statesmanlike. If he continues to be objective in this Parliament, it may be that he is not going to be as bad as I am telling everyone he is.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make a few comments about the wool industry because there is an enormous sense of deja vu here. While I am handling out bouquets, I might say that I could not understand what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was talking about. Hopefully, no-one else in the electorate can either, because I believe that he raised some very dangerous concepts. But I will get on to that in a minute.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1970-72 the Bureau of Agricultural Economics was telling us that wool was finished, there was no future for wool. If there was any advice at all, it was to get out of fine wool and get into medium wool because there was no market for fine wool. That great rural institution, Elder-Smith, was closing down its offices in country towns because there was no future, it told us, and it closed its office in Kalgoorlie-one of the greatest medium quality wool producing areas in Western Australia. I think that should be remembered.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this time there is not in the supply pipeline the stocks of wool that there were in those days. I believe that we are being subjected to a sting by overseas buyers, and I think that the evidence supports that. Honourable members who come into this place and laud the market system should realise that the free market system works with all the precision and finesse of the bull in the china shop, and I do not think that the Australian Wool Corporation is worthy of receiving the tremendous criticism that it received from the honourable member for Parkes tonight. He was revelling in hindsight.
       </para>
       <para>
        The indicators for the price of wool have been very positive over recent years. I would like to dispel the myth that the present price of wool is high. This is nonsense. The presence price of wool, even at the present floor, is much lower than the price at which wool has been traded at. Wool has a very particular niche in the market. It is not in direct competition. What we have to do with wool is to increasingly service that niche and expand that niche market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why have we had this problem? It is true that there has been an increase in supply. Why not? All the market indicators were telling people and all the advice from the experts up until fairly recently was to get into wool. That is not surprising. We have seen downturns in the price of wheat-another great incentive to get into wool. We have seen agricultural departments everywhere very correctly tell farmers that they had to get out of single cropping back into rotational cropping-here again, a need for sheep in that mix. Also, in Western Australia and throughout Australia generally we have had two very good seasons in the last few years. This has not only given us a tremendous increase in the quantity of wool but has also affected the quality, because good seasons increase the micron diameter. I guess we can say that a good season puts two microns on the quality of wool, which has compounded our problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        I address myself to another myth, because many people in my own Party-and listening to members opposite, it seems that the view is also current there-seem to think that we are talking about taxpayers' money. People talk about the cost to us. It must be remembered that this money is woolgrowers' money; it is entirely their money. I shall say more about that, because that is a position I lament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that there is room for confidence in the wool market, and I believe that we will see the price turn up. We are in a position today of inevitability-and I think that the Minister has realised this. There has been so much talk and speculation in the community that only by taking the direct action which he has can we restore that faith in the market and in the floor price, and I am sure that by introducing the regime recommended by the Minister we will see the price of wool settle at a floor which people can be fairly confident will be sustained. In fact, I am very confident that the price will be sustained, and I believe that the trends in the price of wool are up.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are several reasons for that. It is not as though we are having a problem with all our wool. Carpet wools are selling very well. We are still net importers of carpet wool into Australia. At the top end of the market we are doing very well with the very fine materials produced principally by the Italians. It is in that middle range-the great heartland of Australia's-that we have some problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is working on techniques which I think will improve our position. The Sirospin technique, I am told, will conservatively reduce the cost of production by something like $4 a kilo. That is a significant amount and it should be borne in mind when people talk about the current price of wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other developments, such as Sirofill where another fibre is spun with the wool enabling one to produce a much finer yarn with sufficient strength for weaving. That filing fibre can be nylon-nylon is the preferred one because it has the characteristic of taking the same dyeing qualities of wool-but equally it can be cotton or silk. I have long argued that the silk-wool mix is a good one and it should certainly appeal to some of the countries of Asia which have large silk production.
       </para>
       <para>
        A technique is also being developed to use an acetate fibre which dissolves when washed, which means that one can produce a fibre, weave it into a quality worsted, wash it, dissolve away the filling fibre and have a much lighter yarn from this medium quality wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        These developments are a great tribute to CSIRO, especially when one considers that only 0.35c is used for research and development. I believe there is a case for greatly enlarged research and development money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am told that we are about to see a $60m publicity program undertaken by the Wool Marketing Authority to promote these medium quality wools. That is likely to have a substantial impact on the market and we will see things starting to move. As I said earlier, there is no wool stockpile overseas as there was in the 1970s. I believe the indications are there and we can expect prices to rise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some other aspects concern me. Many wool producers are going to be badly hurt by this increase in tax. There is no doubt about that because, believe me, even at 870c a kilo there is no fortune in wool. That of course is the price of clean wool. A lot of people in this Parliament believe that is the price the grower gets. It is not. It is the price that the wool would be worth if it were clean and had no impurities.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must look at giving the industry some micro-assistance. Problems vary from area to area. In Western Australia one of our problems has been the lack of abattoirs. Recently in Kalgoorlie a very foolish, and I think arrogant, council closed down an abattoir. It is true that there had been trouble with the abattoir but I believe the problems could have been negotiated away. What that has done effectively is destroy the one means the wool growers had of getting rid of old sheep and goats. This has several implications, firstly for our concern with soil erosion and salinity. It is not in anyone's interests to have old, unproductive sheep walking around farms or goats on properties when there is no way of getting rid of them. There is a cost involved in mustering and handling these goats. Unless that cost can be recouped through sale to abattoirs there is a great tendency to do nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the present climate we should be looking to government to give some assistance to get an abattoir going, in this case in Kalgoorlie, so that those old sheep can be moved off the farms and the number reduced. If they are not moved off they will be left there. It looks like another good season and, as old as they are, they will probably have another round of lambs.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also believe that we must look at improving the efficiency of the wool support scheme. I believe the scheme has worked very well indeed. Back in the days when I was a woolgrower and it was all being left to the free market, I remember my wool was sold for 14c a kilo when the free market support scheme collapsed. I was not very happy about that at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that if there were a sliding scale of levy, it would have been sending out to growers indications of the market condition more accurately than they have received so far. I would envisage a sliding scale of levy so that when the Corporation was buying very little wool the levy was low, and it would rise as the Corporation had to buy more wool. I admit that that would be a fairly hard thing to gauge, but I am sure it could be gauged, even by trial and error. This is one way whereby direct messages could go out to growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the wool support system is the concern of Australia and not the growers, and I would certainly be looking to give direct government support to maintaining that floor. This will not happen because it is not in the policies of either political party at the moment, but it seems to me that there is a lot of rationality in it. I do not see any difference, quite frankly, between a government holding bars of gold and holding bales of wool. I suppose if there is any difference it is that wool has some intrinsic value where gold has very limited intrinsic value. It would certainly serve to provide the substantial underwriting which would deter the sort of plays we are seeing on the market at the moment, and I will continue to canvass this idea.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another thing we must look at is the price of storage. It is costing the Wool Corporation something like $220 a bale per year to store wool. This is a ridiculous price. I can only suspect that the great bulk of this price is in the interest rates being charged. If the wool were underwritten by the Government, we could store wool for far less and it would give the Corporation much more flexibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Parkes talked about Australia producing only a third of Australia's wool. That is a totally irrelevant figure. What is relevant is how much of the traded wool we produce. In this area the amount is much more substantial. In respect of apparel wool, which is our special forte, it is something over 80 per cent of the market that we control. There might therefore be a case for us, instead of letting these foreign producers cream us, to have been in their markets buying their wool. But, of course, with the resources available to the Wool Corporation that was not possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I want to say that the situation is heartbreaking for wool producers, who have not been having the bonanza people think. There are substantial and rising costs in wool production. They are going to be very tough years ahead. I would say to those people that whenever they can they should hang on, because wool is going to turn around. I have a great faith in the anticyclical nature of wool. We will see a lot of new entrants get out of the industry. I believe that for those who stay and tough it out, where they are able to, there is a future and that future will be good.
       </para>
       <para>
        We really do need to look at rural adjustment and at the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is an absolutely impeccable case, in my view, for providing money to wool producers. What they are doing is buying this country exports. They are producing export earnings for this country which are absolutely vital. In these circumstances I believe there is a case for providing to them a subsidised interest rate. There was a time when the Development Bank did this. Those were the days when it was a development bank; today it is nothing but another merchant bank. I think we ought to be looking at that and we ought to be looking at any help we can provide to woolgrowers through rural adjustment. I know that the Minister would be sympathetic to this, but of course, there are lots of other constraints.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said at the start of my speech, this is a matter of concern to all in Australia because the wool industry is absolutely vital. Not only is it a massive export earner for us but also it is the basis of a lot of employment and a lot of facilities in rural Australia. We are already seeing Australia drifting inevitably to the coast. It is only industries like the wool industry that can keep some semblance of decentralisation in this country. The industry has done a great job. I take my hat off to all those in it. I believe they are being affected by a play on the market. I believe we can tough it out under this new regime and I believe that we must look at making ourselves even more impregnable in the future.

         â€”I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills. I welcome the opportunity to participate for two reasons. First, as has been outlined by all of the speakers in the debate tonight, the wool industry faces what can only be described as perilous times. What is Australia's premier rural industry is facing not necessarily the most difficult times it has known-the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has alluded to that-but times which mean that every wool grower is uncertain about what the future holds and every wool grower knows that no matter what happens to the wool industry the times ahead will be tough. There is no soft option, no easy option, no way out, except for rising costs and falling standards of living for Australia's wool growers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My second reason for welcoming the opportunity to participate in the debate is that, whilst I have not had extensive experience in the wool industry myself-in fact my experience has been principally in the fruit industry and my only experience with sheep has been a few wethers to which I used to feed orange peel from the juice plant; hardly what you would want to use for Australia's premier wool clip-I represent a seat which has at its heart geographically the mining town of Burra and the Burra Valley, which holds Australia's key merino wool growing studs and which has earned itself the deserved reputation as the premier merino area of Australia. Over the town of Burra, over the centre of my electorate and over the wool industry in Australia in May 1990 it is not too dramatic to say that there hangs the sword of Damocles, held by a synthetic thread. I doubt whether at any stage in the history of the Australian wool industry the Parliament has faced a decision that has meant as much and had the repercussions in dollar terms that the decision the Government and Opposition are taking tonight will mean and have for the Australian wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian wool industry has a proud history. It was in 1807 when Captain John Macarthur shipped the first bale of Australian wool to London. He took it from the sheep with half a kilogram-plus of wool per head. Today the average cut from Australian sheep is 4.5 kilograms per head. Australian merinos exceed that average by at least one kilogram per head and Australia's top rams, grown, as I have said, in the heart of my electorate, exceed that average by four times. The Australian merino industry has built its proud history on increasing productivity almost throughout Australia's entire European history-productivity that has been determined by the sorts of breeding techniques and genetic engineering that we see today, and the pioneering work that is going on in the heart of my electorate in the Collinsville stud and in other studs whose work is geared to the increasing production of Australian merino sheep.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of the frustration that we face as a Parliament trying to deal with an industry we face because the Australian merino industry has been so successful in increasing its production. We cannot be critical of it for that. While I stand here and while you, Mr Deputy Speaker, occupy the chair, the sobering fact for every Australian and every Australian sheep grower is that those sheep standing in those paddocks-in the eastern States of Australia in some cases with very wet feet-are growing fibre at the rate of 25 feet of minute fibre every minute. That is another 25 feet on every sheep every minute for which there has to be found a home somewhere around the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been said by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and probably by other honourable members, wool occupies about 5 per cent of the world clothing and fibre market. So we have an extra 25 feet of fibre every minute and, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has said, rarely in the history of wool has annual production found the market expected for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish the nation could emulate something like the productive capacity of the wool industry, but the great problem that the nation faces is that it has an increasing tax burden-calculated I must say at the debt summit to have been 35 per cent in real terms during the period of this Government-while in the same period salaries have risen by a mere 7 per cent in real terms. So Australians and Australian wool farmers have had a higher tax burden and less to spend.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dilemma faced by the Australian wool farmer and by the nation is that this sort of policy enunciated by the Government has resulted in high interest rates and high costs of production and, most acutely of all, in an artificially high Australian dollar, which presents a real problem for the marketing of Australian wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        While tonight the Government participates in this debate in a bipartisan way, and while speakers have largely been supportive of what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), his Department and the Government propose, my role and that of the Opposition is not to stand here tonight and support the Government and nor, I would reiterate-and the honourable member for Barker made this point in response to a challenge from the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth)-is it to stand here and set the reserve price. Former governments, and their decision has been reinforced by the Minister, handed back that responsibility to the people who run the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our role as a Parliament is to support the Australian merino industry, or, more accurately, Australian woolgrowers no matter which breed of sheep they favour. Our role is to ensure that decisions about such things as the reserve price, which the honourable member for Perth challenged the honourable member for Barker to comment upon, are made not by the Parliament but by the industry. We all have had a lot of advice-although I must agree with the honourable member for Parkes, not directly to us but through the media-from the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia about what our role ought to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Parkes has been very critical of both the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council. I recognise that one of the problems facing the wool industry is that, when a country has only 5 per cent of the world fibre market, it is easy for the alternative fibre materials to provide real competition. But we must remember that there are areas of the world fibre market where no fibre can match wool. Those of us who wear woollen suits would say that that is a typical area, but a more significant and more common marketplace area is the production of socks. I am told there is no fibre to match wool and, as a result, 50 per cent of the world sock market is met by the wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not particularly want to enter into a criticism of either the Council or the Corporation. I suspect it is easy to be critical with the benefit of hindsight, but when one is sitting there making the decisions, not knowing what the future holds and not able to predict what political and economic decisions are around the corner, it is difficult to be as objective as we are tonight with the benefit of hindsight.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think, however, that one of the challenges that the Corporation faces and one of the challenges faced by the International Secretariat is the challenge of promotion and the challenge of ensuring that wool is seen for the quality fibre that it is. The honourable member for Barker has already given an eloquent history of the floor price in the Australian wool industry. I want briefly to refer to the reasons we are standing here tonight and the reasons we face this dilemma over how we deal with Australia's premier rural industry and Australia's third largest individual export earner.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first reason that the industry is in difficulty is simply because no-one could predict what happened in China almost 12 months ago. No-one imagined the Tiananmen Square disaster would happen. Just when we presumed China was moving to the accepted standards of the free world, that move was thwarted. As a result of the Tiananmen Square disaster China curtailed its buying pattern of Australia's wool and took a totally different attitude to the purchase of imports and to its economic situation. It has been predicted that, but for that disaster, had China continued to buy Australia's wool at the rate and pattern that had been established and laid down, the Australian Wool Corporation would be holding only 1.2 million bales in stock compared to the 2.8 million bales it expects to have in stock at the end of June this year. That factor alone would have made an enormous difference to what happened to the Australian wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        That Chinese reality is further complicated by what happened in Russia. The Russians, burdened by a socialist economy, by an incapacity to produce competitive exports, by an incapacity to be productive, have found themselves defaulting on some payments-though all of us found the comments of the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) today mildly reassuring. At this time Russia's purchases of Australian wool have slowed down and its capacity to purchase further has been under question as a result of its incapacity to pay. China and Russia alone provided a burden to the Wool Corporation that could not have been predicted.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, we have the situation of an Australian dollar that has been set artificially high by what is loosely called a dirty float and which discourages sales and makes the export of produce even more difficult. While the Minister may well want to take issue with that, none the less the point remains that while the rest of the world expects the Australian dollar to fall, honourable members can bet London to a brick that buyers will not be rushing into the market if they think the Australian dollar may have to move down. That is another reason for the reluctance of buyers to participate and another reason why the Australian wool industry is in difficulty.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the other exacerbating reason that I alluded to in my opening remarks-the production of Australian wool has never been higher. Not surprisingly, farmers particularly in an electorate such as mine, have moved out of continuous wheat production and have gone back into wool. Given the results in the wool market over the last three years any farmer may reasonably have taken that course.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the situation where production has risen so dramatically that in the last four years it has gone up over 30 per cent as sheep numbers escalate. So we have a situation where by the time the Parliament goes into recess, and certainly by the end of this financial year, an estimated 2.8 million bales will be in store and each one of those bales costing $210 or $220 a year to hold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kalgoorlie clearly illustrated that much of that cost is borne as a result of the Government's present high interest rate policy. I have alluded to the fact that if a bale costs $210 to hold, every farmer must say at the end of five years, `What was the point of having it stored when it has cost me what it was worth anyway?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a further complication that I ought to allude to. A summary sheet crossed my desk this afternoon reflecting on the wool situation in South Africa. Mr Olivier, the spokesman for the South African industry, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . South African wool stocks were presently about 200 million kg. Production this year was expected to be about ninety-eight million kg of which the Board-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the South African Board-
       </para>
       <para>
        expected to sell at least 80 per cent at auction.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is not only the Australian industry that faces accumulating stocks and, for that reason, the Australian industry must be concerned about what is happening in other parts of the world as well. Our capacity to move our existing reservoir of wool will be further exacerbated by the experience of other competitive producers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Parkes said, `Well that is the situation but, after all, it could turn around. Unpredictabilities occur in respect of every major Australian rural commodity. The situation could turn up or turn down'. I agree with him. Who knows when the Chinese might start buying again? Who knows when the Russians may be encouraged to participate more actively in the Australian wool market? Who knows what will happen to the Australian dollar and when world buyer will feel that they ought to be carrying stocks of their own? Who can say that after an unprecedented run of good years we will not have a drought around the corner and there will be the possibility of a real downturn in Australian production anyway? Maybe much of the optimism exuded by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is well founded. Even if it is, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said, 870c a kilogram is not the money the farmer gets, that is 870c clean and that is, in itself, no fortune. No matter which way one looks at the Australian wool industry, with the prospect of falling incomes and rising costs Australian wool growers face a bleak outlook indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I have been annoyed to read in the South Australian press that the Australian Democrats were prepared, not surprisingly I suppose, to make political capital out of this dilemna that the Australian wool industry faces and that we, as a parliament, are endeavouring to address. The Australian Democrats have suggested that if Senator John Olsen were to represent his State effectively-and a by-election will be held in his State seat of Custance as a result of his moving to the Senate-he ought to be prepared to cross the floor of the Senate and push for a 25 per cent tax in place of a 20 per cent tax. If I were a Senator representing South Australia I would be voting in the Senate for the 20 per cent wool tax proposed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I would be doing so to represent my producers. As the honourable member for Barker, the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) have said, there is very little difference between the 20 and the 25 per cent options. The industry would be better served by us making a decision and making it while this Parliament is sitting. Members of the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Wool Exporters have pleaded with the Opposition to achieve the first option rather than chase what maybe an elusive 25 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I take issue with the Australian Democrats and with Senator Lees. I have no quarrel with people choosing to represent their electorate and Senator Olsen is free to do whatever he will. But for Senator Lees to pretend that to fail to do as she demands is to fail to represent the electorate, I find totally offensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stand here representing my electorate and supporting the legislation that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has introduced because I believe it is in the best interests not only of the wool growers of Wakefield but also of the wool growers of Australia. From the figures provided by the Australian Bureau Agricultural and Resource Economics, by the Wool Council, by the Australian Wool Corporation and by the Minister in the letter he sent out to all wool farmers, I am certain that such a decision is in the long term interests of Australia's premier rural industry.

         â€”I join other members in supporting the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills before us. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will recall the day I went to see him when Cabinet and the Caucus were making a decision about this legislation. I went representing the local industry following a meeting and discussions I had had with people from the New South Wales Farmers Association and others who pointed out that they wanted to see the argument about the need to increase the levy to 25 per cent put forward. In the end, we had to weigh up a whole range of factors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Honourable members from both sides of the House who have spoken before me have recognised those factors honestly and fairly and presented the position very well. I do not want to repeat what they have said. Certainly, there have been problems which have led to the present situation where we have had a record 1.2 million tonnes in 1989-90. That represents an extraordinary increase of 13 per cent during this season. We have to face the reasons why this happened. There has been a trend to sheep because of fairly high demand. There have been very good seasons. We were selling well to countries such as China, Eastern Europe and Japan.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I lived in the Wimmera I can recall farmers saying that if we sold one sock to every Chinese we would get rid of our wool clip. Maybe at the moment we need to sell a pair of socks to every Chinese. I think the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) talked about the fact that 50 per cent of the world's soft production depends on wool because of the peculiarity of the garment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another problem has been the fact that not so long ago some countries bought big. Japan now has stockpiles. There have been accusations about manipulation by other countries. This may well be true. We cannot deny the fact that there have been stockpiles in Japan, particularly of raw and semi-processed material. We also need to recognise the fact that the problem is not just one of price.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has been put to me by a number of farmers in the electorate-representatives such as Ned Kater, David Hallam, John Turner and Vic Karja from the south-east region. I believe there are a few people for me to phone tonight who want to talk to me about the legislation before us. Vic Karja from Jerangle made the point that it is a bit rough preventing borrowing of more than $2.5 billion from overseas by the wool industry when we allow people such as John Elliott and Alan Bond to borrow billions to restructure their own industries. Why can we not let this happen to the wool industry? Of course, like any sound entrepreneur, the wool industry has to think out the consequences to itself of that borrowing.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a government directly involved with the wool industry, we also need to think out the consequences of that borrowing on the country. No matter what decisions are taken, an enormous stockpile confronts us. It costs $220 a bale a year of wool growers' money to store a bale of wool. In five years that bale, if it is sold at nearly $1,000, will have cost $1,000 to store. All of us, whether we are in the industry, government or elsewhere, must recognise that we lose a lot of money as we continue to store wool.

        One farmer suggested placing a quota on production based on averages over five or 10 years. I shuddered as I reflected on the quota system which necessarily operates in the fishing industry and all the problems that we have with quotas. In the fishing industry most of the farmers are common farmers. Fish, of course, are wildlife so the situation is entirely different. But there are tremendous problems with quotas. We find them in the fishing industry, the dairy industry and other industries.

        Two or three people have suggested-and the suggestion has been made tonight, and it is a fair point-that we should allow the value of the dollar to move down. Some might say we should force the dollar to move down. It depends on one's point of view, I suppose. But I believe that we in Australia do not have a particularly dirty float of the dollar when we look at the dollar in other countries like the United States of America which other countries have to support because of the importance of the American dollar internationally. We do not have the luxury of support from other countries, and I believe that we have a pretty clean float of the dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        The points that have been raised by farmers, and even processors, who have talked to me cover a wide range of issues. The important ones are the dollar, which I have mentioned, the tax rate, the floor price, the level of borrowings and marketing. There are strong arguments for the 25 per cent tax rate, as I said before. We could try to keep the floor price up and we could legitimately say that lower prices will not sell more wool. Some farmers have said this to me. But I think we need to make the point that if we keep the floor price at $8.70 we could face an even higher tax, perhaps up to 32 to 33 per cent, to hold that floor price. We could allow the floor price lower; that is another alternative.

I believe that the more established grower who has paid off his or her farm would not be so badly off. People who are well established would certainly receive a lower price for their wool but they can sometimes stock up their sheep. They have sometimes got that opportunity because of their position, because of the size of the farm perhaps, because of their liquidity. They can even buy other farms. They have the advantage of being able to pay a lower price for sheep.

        But there are growers-new growers, specialty growers-who will be hurt and who will be a lot worse off. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has pointed out, people in the medium range are worse hit than those in the fine wool range and some of the other specialty ranges.

       <para>
        I ought to point out also a matter that I did not hear mentioned tonight although unfortunately I could not be here for the whole debate. We got a message from the Carpet Institute of Australia. I feel its point of view ought to be stated clearly in Hansard. I think it is particularly important to note that carpet manufacturers in Australia, import 90 per cent of their wool requirements because local growers cannot meet demand. We are putting them in the one box with other wool growers. The presently estimated value of the wool used by the carpet industry in Australia is $117m. Australian wool accounts for about $20m.
       </para>
       <para>
        The carpet industry is not a particularly big industry; nevertheless it is important. We in this Parliament represent primary producers who may not be producing large exports but which nevertheless can be quite significant. They include honey growers and a whole range of industries that we support. We ought not forget the fact that the carpet wool people have made a point. They believe that they face bankruptcy caused by an inequitable imposition of wool tax to fund Australia's growing mountain of unsold merino wool. That is their point. They say that, after years of contributing wool tax which has been used to assist other sections of the wool industry, Australia's carpet wool growers should not be required to be involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Carpet Wool Council has suggested that carpet wool producers agree to pay an industry levy of 6 per cent. That is equivalent to and in parity with New Zealand producers with the same micron wools. Thus, producers on either side of the Tasman would be equal in regard to the wool tax. It is proposed that the 6 per cent wool levy be collected by the Australian Wool Corporation, that 3.5 per cent be retained for administration, and promotion of wool carpets, with the remaining 2.5 per cent to be returned to the Australian Carpet Wool Council-2 per cent would be held in trust for the benefit of the carpet wool industry and 0.5 per cent would be used for research and development. The Council believes that wool with a mean fibre diameter equal to or greater than 32 microns that is used in the production of carpet yarn should be excluded from the current wool industry system. It is easy for us to neglect a small section of industry, and I think that these points ought to at least be made during this debate and recorded in Hansard.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred previously to the level of borrowings and the fact that a number of producers have made points about the level of borrowings. As I said, when considering borrowings we need to take into account not only the effect on certain wool growers, or indeed the industry, but the nation as a whole. We are doing that with other industries. For instance it is being done with the superannuation industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        We then come to the most important point of those that have been made. It was put to me earlier in the discussions that I have had with David Hallam of the regional body of the New South Wales Farmers Association. I attended a recent conference held at the National Press Club by that association's regional operation. At that conference, David Fletcher Jones put forward the very important need to have versatility in presentation.

        I agreed with the comments made by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) earlier today in his maiden speech about his father impressing upon him the fact that within the political system there is a lot of integrity that is not recognised in the community. I must say that my own father instilled that view into me as well-that politicians were not bad. Tonight we have heard some very constructive debate and arguments from members on both sides of the House, with goodwill. While we recognise the fact that we have an industry that is in trouble, and we all agree that the wool industry is a strong one and that it will come back in a very strong way, we must not neglect the important factor-marketing.

         â€”In rising to speak on the Wool Tax Amendment Bills, Nos 1 to 5, I must first declare an interest as a wool grower. I am also a representative of an electorate that is famous Australia wide not only for the quantity of the wool that it grows but also the quality. It is with a certain amount of pride that I can stand up here and say that despite the fact that the wool industry is facing probably the most difficult decision it has had to make for 20 years, I believe that the confidence of people in my electorate will be such that they will continue to make a big contribution to that industry. Also, within my electorate lies Hamilton, known as the wool capital not only of Australia but of the world.

       <para>
        First of all, I would like to say how disappointed I am that the Government has chosen to apply the guillotine to this legislation as, indeed, it has to over 30 Bills that are being debated this week. I find it almost impossible to understand how a government, only weeks after an election, could apply the guillotine to so many Bills that in so many different ways are important to so many Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Woolgrowers are facing a very difficult decision. No matter what happens, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has already said, people are going to be hurt and some are going to be hurt very badly. That is something that all honourable members should be aware of because this is a very serious situation facing the industry. I think what has stunned many people involved in the industry is the speed with which the whole market has turned around. In fact, it has obviously caught many of the grower leaders completely unawares, and the decision that was taken only last year to revolve not one but two years' contributions by growers in previous years shows that there was a lack of appreciation of what was just around the corner. I think this is probably one of the things that has concerned growers-not just the immediate effects, but the difficulty with which the industry seems able to find what is around the corner.
       </para>
       <para>
        While not opposing the Government's decision to raise the wool tax levy ceiling to 20 per cent from the current maximum of 10 per cent-which is currently being levied at only 8 per cent-I have to say that I do have some criticisms of the Government's macro-policies because I believe they have, in a very large way, exacerbated some of the problems that the industry is facing today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Talking about the wool tax levy, it is interesting to note that three Labor backbenchers have suggested in their speeches that the industry should be lowering the floor price. It is interesting because I note that, to date at least, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, has not said this. I wonder whether this is some softening up process that is being offered by backbenchers to try to influence the industry to make a decision when, to date at least, the Minister has not been prepared to offer that sort of advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I come back to the main point that I want to make in this debate. I think most of the points have already been covered by speakers, particularly on this side but on both sides of the chamber, about the problems that the industry faces and some of the prospective outcomes that lie ahead if what could be said to be worst case scenarios are around over the next five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think there are three very serious matters that the present Government has to answer in relation to the wool industry. One could almost say they are three very serious charges about the way the Government has neglected this industry, has not helped the problem and, in a couple of cases, has probably exacerbated the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first one-as has been alluded to not only by honourable members on this side of the chamber by also, at least, by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and even the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)-is the problem of high interest rates. It is interesting to note that Government speakers indirectly by their comments are, in fact, criticising the macro-policies that have been espoused by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). There is no doubt that the high interest rate policy that has been pursued by the Treasurer and the associated effect on the value of our dollar have hurt all exporters but, in particular, primary producers. In this case we have a tangible example of the damage it can do in what is happening to the wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point that I would like to allude to-it is one that has not been raised in this debate so far-is the Government's broken promise on wool promotion following the 1987 election. I will go into it in more detail in a minute. It is something that is quite serious. While at the time the Government may have felt that it slid out of it without too much pain, the fact is that it is now going to come back to haunt it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third and most serious charge that I would lay against the Government over this whole problem of the wool industry is the utter hypocrisy that was recently displayed by leaders of the Government when they urged woolgrowers to consider the good of the nation. Until recently woolgrowers were not even considered; now we are seeing all sorts of pious words uttered by senior Cabinet Ministers. It reminds me of the old saying that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. I think senior Government Ministers, including the Treasurer, stand condemned for the hypocrisy which they have displayed towards the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even apart from these three points, the Government cannot wash its hands of the problems that are facing the industry. The Government does have much to answer for. For years senior Ministers, particularly the Treasurer, have been boasting about how they are going to diversify this economy, how they are going to remove our dependence on primary producers and primary industries and how they are going to have these new sunrise industries and revive the manufacturing industries, et cetera. Yet when we look at the reality, like it or not the importance of primary produce is probably as great today as it has ever been.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point I am coming to is that by doing this the Government has tended to create an impression in the wider community that the farming interests and the interests of the people in the country generally are of lesser importance today than they were some years ago. This perception has been emphasised by many decisions taken by the Government. These decisions have led to a winding back of the support that has been given to some of these industries, support that could be justified on any grounds but which to many people in the country is a matter of maintaining there lifeblood.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will look at some more specific examples of this. Despite the warnings and the pleas by industry, by the Opposition and by people who are directly involved we have seen the winding back of funding for research. We have seen the cuts over a number of years to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) cuts that severely hampered some of its programs to the point where, had there not been a change of heart in the last year or so, the whole function of some of the divisions would have been seriously eroded. There seems to be such hypocrisy for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to campaign and say, `We are going to become a cleverer nation and become more involved in science', when we look at the record of what has happened to the CSIRO in particular over the last few years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's changing this perception and this emphasis has had a spin-off in the States. We have seen the State departments of agriculture cutting back on their research. While it may have little effect in the short term, over the longer term it is extremely serious if we are going to maintain a viable industry, not just a wool industry but all our primary industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, with this changing of perception, this idea that they are of lesser importance than these new glamour industries that the Government is going somehow to create, we have seen a running down of the infrastructure in the country. The most glaring and obvious way of seeing that is in our country roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now come back specifically to the issue of the Government's deliberate policy of maintaining high interest rates. I think this was alluded to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I just wish that he would tell the Treasurer the damage it is doing. Maybe we might see the Treasurer eventually start to realise how much hurt and hardship he is causing. High interest rates are hitting growers with both barrels. Firstly, the Government is increasing the cost of borrowings, which is inhibiting growers. But more importantly, probably, right now high interest rates are adding dramatically to the cost of the stockpile that the Australian Wool Corporation currently holds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second barrel that is being aimed straight at growers and, of course, at all exporters is that by maintaining this high interest rate policy the value of the Australian dollar is being propped up, and there is no doubt that these two points are the most important factors in the problems facing the Australian wool industry now.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at the holding charges that have been mentioned already by honourable members in this chamber, the Corporation is paying out something like $220 per bale per year to store wool, and of this $220, $180-by far and away the biggest amount of that holding charge-is interest. Whichever way one looks at the interest charges, if they were eight per cent lower, for argument's sake, that would mean $80 per bale per year less. Over the whole borrowings of the Wool Corporation today, that would mean savings of $80m to $90m.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Corporation did happen to increase the stockpile, according to some of the projections, some of which I think are probably on the pessimistic side, and the borrowings increased to $3 billion or $4 billion, then clearly the savings, if these interest rates were to be brought down, could be of the order of $300m-a very substantial sum of money by any measure. These are the direct tangible costs of the Treasurer's high interest rate policy. Of course, we could go through the same exercise with the Australian dollar. If the value of the dollar was to vary by whatever amount, its effect would be similar not only on the stockpile but on the returns in general of wool growers of the wool that is still being sold.
       </para>
       <para>
        So really the Australian woolgrower has been caught in a vice which is being screwed down by the Treasurer, and this vice has been clearly coming from both ends-high interest rates and the high value of the dollar. In fact, it is affecting growers individually and the Corporation in its ability to run the present stockpile.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point, which I now come back to, is the 1987 broken promise. Honourable members may recall that in June 1987 the Government gave a very clear undertaking to the wool industry in which it promised that it was committed to the current arrangement-I am sure that the Minister will not forget this-whereby the Government contribution to wool promotion had been `placed on a predictable, long term basis'. Those were the words used at the time. That predictable, long term basis was to be backed up by a contribution of 1.2 per cent of the gross value of production. That was in June 1987, just before the election of that year. By the time we got round to the Budget, just three months after that promise was given, it was broken, and the Treasurer took the decision-no doubt with the agreement of his Cabinet colleagues-to freeze the Government contribution to $35m. So much for the predictable, long term basis; so much for the 1.2 per cent.

         â€”It probably did get rolled in Cabinet. This promise was not just broken once. Not happy with having done it once, we had a mini-Budget the following year and again, in May 1988, the Government contribution was further cut-this time to $25m. That is a sorry reflection on the ability of governments to keep their promises. Is it any wonder that there is a level of cynicism towards the present Government and its so-called election promises?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Furthermore, in this cutback that the Government undertook not only had the Government broken a promise but it ignored the firm recommendation of an inquiry that the Government had set up itself. The Wool Promotion Review Committee was set up by the Government to advise it on what level of government support there ought to be for wool promotion. The Committee reported to the Government back in March 1988. There is little doubt what the inquiry's views were about the importance of maintaining the level of Government support for promotion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's key recommendation was that there be an immediate target of 5 per cent of gross value of production going into promotion and that the Government should agree to contribute up to 1 3/4 per cent calculated on the basis of the moving average of gross value of the product over the last three years. In other words, there was a certain predictability there. The Government was not going to be caught with sudden rises or falls. But nonetheless it was very clear that it was 1.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just to make sure the Government did not feel awkward about that, the Committee went on to say that a ceiling ought to be placed on the Government's contribution at a level of $45m in 1988-89 values. Those recommendations came to the Government in March 1988. Yet, despite that, by May 1988 the Government had not only ignored them but also had cut back the Government contribution from $35m back to $25m.
       </para>
       <para>
        I dare say the Minister might try to defend that on the basis that by that stage the woolgrowers' contribution had started to rise quite significantly and we could afford to cut back. How short-sighted can you get. Clearly, cutting back on promotion at that time has led to the further problem that exists now where the amount available for promotion in the coming year will be significantly less than it was in the last year. When there is a downturn in the market the need to increase promotion is obvious. One has only to talk to any marketing expert and he will say that when one is running into sticky times the best thing one can do is go out and market that product, promote it and push it harder.
       </para>
       <para>
        On both those points the Government has very serious charges to answer, but the overall one-the one that really concerns me-is the hypocrisy being displayed by senior Cabinet Ministers now when they talk about patriotism and when they appeal to the industry in the national interest. I find that very hard to take. It sticks in one's craw to know that having been ignored for all those years suddenly people find the industry when they think it suits them.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that woolgrowers are facing very difficult times no matter what is done. There is no doubt that the Wool Council of Australia, at its meeting next week in Roma, in facing a very difficult decision. There is no doubt that whatever that decision is it will make life very difficult for growers and for the Wool Corporation in its efforts to try to market Australian wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I conclude on a slightly different note and read from a book entitled The Wool Crisis. The foreword to the book said:
       </para>
       <para>
        To tell the full story of the Australian wool industry would take many books. Rarely have the fortunes of one country been so closely linked with one industry. It is a little sad therefore that this collection of articles should only deal with the rapid and almost catastrophic decline of the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The wool story from now on can only be one of contraction but we feel these articles put into perspective the forces that brought that contraction about.
       </para>
       <para>
        That may not sound very surprising to some people right now, but it would surprise them if I said that the book was published in 1971.
       </para>
       <para>
        What that quote illustrates is that the wool industry over many years has shown remarkable resilience. I dare say that many growers would have vivid memories of proving the predictions contained in this book wrong. But I also remind honourable members that while there might have been some satisfaction in proving them wrong, the fact is that there was an awful lot of pain then before that happened. Unfortunately, there will be an awful lot more paid before we can do it again.

        The wool industry is in a very serious situation. The largest stockpile ever before was 1.6 million bales. In a very short space of time we will have about 2.8 million bales-that is by the end of this season. It has been a very different stockbuild. In other words, the factors that have led to it mean that the industry has to take a very firm and serious look at its own future. The Government too has to make sure that decisions we take guarantee this industry's viability.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many figures out and many members have used those figures. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has brought out the most comprehensive paper on this issue. It has been working on that paper with the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and the Wool Council of Australia since December of last year. I do not always believe economists. I do not believe that the world runs on tapered roller bearings of supply and demand, but the estimates that are being put out include certain assumptions. Just as valid to take into account are commercial factors. At the end of the day, we all end up making judgments after we analyse the facts before us. Economic logic, not just figures and conclusions based on assumptions, really does tell us that increased wool taxes on their own will do nothing about consumption and will continue to assist producers in other countries, with further erosion of Australia's market shares to synthetics and wool producers elsewhere. If a lot of wool producers in Australia get out of the industry and production falls, with a large stockpile an even greater load will fall upon the shoulders of the remaining wool producers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have looked back over the years at the advice of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) and the ABARE to the industry on the setting of the reserve price, and the advice has proved right. They would have had a lower price. Some of the assumptions they included in their work meant that the estimates of stocks under those assumptions were wrong. But their advice was always cautious.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another thing to take into account is grower behaviour and industry politics. One of the bits of homespun wisdom that people were putting a while back was that the sheep farmers out in the so-called station country, the marginal country, should not have given up sheep and gone into wheat. As prices rise and fall in the various commodities, there always seem to be a tonne of people around with a lot of wisdom in hindsight.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I look at the industry's politics over a long period, the positions of leadership in the wool industry have depended to a large degree on commitment to the status quo, particularly in wool marketing. I go back to 1971, when I worked in the Australian Objective Measurement Project. Objective measurement, of course, was resisted. Bill Gunn and Bill Vines know all about resistance in the wool industry. There are always in this industry political pressures for higher prices from producers in the belief that they have some monopoly power. There is still a lot of logic in a minimum reserve price scheme in this industry because if this country does produce 70 per cent of the world's textile wool, it will have some chance of having a buffer stock scheme that will work. But a lot of things have changed. The flexible exchange rate means that it is a lot more difficult now to have a buffer stock scheme that works. The fall in the value of the Australian dollar in 1987 and 1988 was one of the main reasons for the increase in demand. The extent that it was a permanent change in demand has really yet to be tested but, basically, it did not really indicate that to the extent that some people believe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The central issue as far as I am concerned is that, whatever figures are used and whatever assumptions are made, I am very prepared to use the Australian Wool Corporation's figures and the Australian Wool Council's figures. Next year at about this time we will be looking at a range of between 4 and 4.7 million bales. Whatever figures and assumptions are used, another year out we will be looking to 4.2 to 6 million bales. That is by June 1992. If things go back, we will have an even worse situation. We will be looking at 6.5 million bales, a 41 per cent tax and fewer producers to pay it. That is on the assumption of a floor price start at 870c and a 25 per cent tax. If there is a drought and if the exchange rate comes down more than the assumptions in the ABARE paper, then we have a different set of assumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us just say that the range is 4 million to 4.7 million bales; a year out and we will be looking at a 32 per cent tax. It will be so much harder to take decisions at this time next year if we have a stockpile of 4 million to 4.7 million bales-three times larger than the largest stockpile we have ever had. The industry will be faced with hardly any option. The fact is that it is easier to take a hard decision now after two good years than next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many calculations, many estimates, many choices and many options. But a hard decision earlier under some estimates could save the industry up to $1 billion. I am saying exactly where I come down in all of this. It is all about an assessment of risk. The reason I put out this paper from the ABARE, which was commercial-in-confidence until the last few days, was so that I could try to get out as much information as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        I see in the media that I am supposed to be accusing the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia of keeping the growers blinded to the facts. I am not making accusations so much as a statement of fact in saying that the growers have had exactly the same problem as I have had: that the commercial hazard in exploding a lot of estimates and data before the industry would be read by the trade and we would have exactly the situation that we have now.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been taking these decisions about this time every year. This time the Parliament is meeting in May; sometimes it goes into June. Maybe it would be better if we were making these decisions a month later, but we cannot influence that. The Wool Council and the Wool Corporation brought out three sets of figures: an 870c floor price and 25 per cent tax; 870c floor price and 20 per cent tax; and 700c floor price and 20 per cent tax. Those have been on the table since 10 May. I did not say anything then. I did not say anything until the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) brought in this legislation. So I had to come out and say something about it on 10 May. Since that time I have been trying to get out as much information as I possibly can.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will be meeting the board of the Australian Wool Corporation tomorrow and will ask it to put before me as much commercial information as it possibly can because I do put as much store by commercial information as I do by economic logic and economic information. I will be talking to the Wool Council of Australia to try to ensure that it takes the best possible decision in its interests. After that process I will be put in the position of having to make a judgment and I will take my judgment to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, there is not much that I can say additionally. The first and foremost consideration of the Parliament in these Bills must be to protect the long term viability of the industry. In order to have legislation in place to support the reserve price scheme the Government had to take a decision on the maximum wool tax rate ahead of the Wool Council's conference in Roma next week and of the Australian Wool Corporation's consideration of the minimum reserve price. This decision on the tax rate has been made after close consultation with the industry and careful consideration of detailed assessments by the AWC and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. As I have said, they all point to similar scenarios. The industry has to look at a range of things. I keep on saying this publicly; there is not much saying it again in this place. There is no sense at looking at one factor in isolation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just reflect on some elements in the debate, which I have described already as excellent-in some cases to correct some misapprehensions and in other cases to correct judgments. First of all, one has to accept that there is a fair degree of validity in what has been said about high interest rates. But those farmers with a positive cash income-those who have earned extra income over the last two years-have, of course, benefited from high interest rates. When the fund was building-it built up to $1.8 billion-the high interest rates advantaged the industry during that build-up. It is only a minor point, I know, compared with the overall effect of high interest rates on the economy, but there is an up side as well as a down side.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) raised the question of carpet wool. I have been petitioned by carpet wool growers about trying to get a differential rate of levy for them. I think the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) also wanted to raise that point. He has already had a few words with me. I have met growers in the seat of McMillan about this matter. The whole problem is that, if we give a differential levy or some special consideration in this instance, equally the fine wool growers could ask for the same dispensation. But 25 per cent on 1,100c is a lot more than 25 per cent on the lower prices that the carpet wool people are getting. It may be that in one or two years' time, while we still have this stockpile, the medium grades of wool will be selling a lot better. So it is very hard to get a differential rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to address quite a few points made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I also want to reflect on one made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). The honourable member for Murray quoted from my speech in 1987 when we gave the Corporation as much commercial flexibility as we thought sensible, and certainly as much as possible. We believed that the Corporation and the growers should be making the decisions on a commercial basis free from the political environment-I agree with that and I still stick to that-and also free from industry political pressures. It is very hard to avoid that. In many ways, I regret that the Corporation's board is not more commercial than it presently is.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member commented on the industry's responsibility. I point out that governments do have a responsibility. Unlike some in the National Party, I take the view that it is not my role to agree with a certain industry. If one is looking at industrial relations, I do not believe it is sensible simply to agree with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), or, if one is looking at the wool industry, simply to agree with the Wool Council. I believe that Cabinet Ministers have a prime responsibility to stand back from some of the industry politics in these issues and try to take a decision in the national interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Corporation is still a different sort of commercial entity. The Corporation's board still retains the powers of government and it does that because this Parliament gives it the power to tax. We are now passing Bills to give it the power to increase by nearly 400 per cent the amount of money going to the minimum reserve price scheme. So, the board is not really subject to purely commercial disciplines and, therefore, the Government still has to try to define some sort of appropriate balance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Leader of the National Party also said that several Ministers have already intervened. Mr Sawers of the Wool Council said that I have interfered and that is because I did not agree with him on the figure of 25 per cent. I do not see how I have intervened-and that gentleman nominated me, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Cook) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I made no statement on this matter in any precise terms until 10 May, after these Bills were introduced. I have been trying to give the industry as much latitude as possible to make its decisions. I have been trying to put forward arguments and take decisions in a sequential way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I read what Senator Cook said in the Senate. I cannot see that he had intervened in any way. A lot of criticism has been accorded to the Treasurer and it is assumed that he has always been an easy mark. A line, which appeared today in the Australian, and which has probably given rise to these accusations about the Treasurer's intervention, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A fear of a balance of payments blowout forced a cut in the wool levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know how going from 10 per cent to 20 per cent is a cut in the wool levy, but there you go. The facts are these: late last year I met with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer to acquaint them with the stock problem in the wool industry. This problem was first drawn to my attention in November. I must say that at that time my view was that they had gone through this before. But people said, `No, we think there is a different situation on our hands'. My reaction was exactly the same as the industry's largely is today. I put before the Prime Minister and the Treasurer the difficult position that everyone could be in-the industry and the Government-and informed them of what I was doing, and that was meeting quietly with the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation trying to get agreed monitoring of the whole situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I next met with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) about three weeks ago to bring them up-to-date with the analyses that had been done in an earlier paper to this one because we now had something very significant before us and we also had a range of estimates. All the discussion at that meeting focused on the wool industry, the wool growers and the options available. The $2.5 billion borrowing agreement had already been agreed.

        â€”We have before the House the Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill 1990 which forms part of the broader processes involved in the Australia New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement, an initiative started by the coalition government in terms of negotiation in the late 1970s. It is pleasing to see our efforts in this area coming to fruition. The Bill under consideration seeks to implement Article 4 of the protocol to the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement on the Acceleration of Free Trade in Goods which was entered into in August 1988.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Before considering some of the details of the Bill, I will give a brief overview of the substance of it. The Bill makes amendments to a fairly significant number of Acts including the following: The Trade Practices Act 1974, by extending competition provisions to the trans-Tasman market and by allowing the Trade Practices Commission to obtain information from New Zealand for the purposes of investigating complaints-that is part 2; the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1981, by exempting goods of New Zealand origin from the provisions of that Act-part 3; the Customs Act 1901 by amending section 151 of that Act, dealing with the test of origin for goods to give effect to the exemption of New Zealand goods from dumping duty-part 4; the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, by amending section 9 of that Act so that New Zealand goods are not subject to third country dumping duty-part 5; the Evidence Act 1905, by introducing a new part VA to facilitate the admissibility or recognition of official New Zealand documents in proceedings under the proposed extended competition and information provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974-part 6; the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, by introducing a new part IIIA to implement reciprocal arrangements between the Federal Court and the High Court of New Zealand for trans-Tasman market proceedings in relation to the proposed competition and information provisions-part 7; the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987, by amending section 4 of that Act so that proceedings under proposed part IIIA of the federal court Act cannot be determined in State or Territory Courts. So honourable members can see the provisions of this legislation cut across an extraordinarily wide number of Acts already in force and make the appropriate amendments as referred to.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having described the outline of the Bill and the changes it will make, I wish to inform the House of the background circumstances that lead to the August 1988 protocol and the creation of this Bill. Before doing so perhaps I should confirm to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who has paid us the credit of being in the House for the passage of this legislation, that we shall be supporting the Bill, albeit that we have some concerns. I will return to these concerns later.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1983 the closer economic relations (CER) agreement was entered into with a target date of 1995 for the establishment of full free trade between Australia and New Zealand. The agreement sets out the groundwork for the establishment of future bilateral trade and the liberalisation of protected sectors by the reduction of tariffs and the removal of export subsidies. In 1988 a review was conducted on CER and it was then decided that the 1995 date should be brought forward five years to 1 July 1990. The proviso to full free trade is, of course, that the relevant goods and services originate from either Australia or New Zealand. The CER article 3, sets out a formula which has been applied in section 151, subsection 7 of the Customs Act. The test is whether the last process of manufacture was performed in New Zealand and not less than 50 per cent of their factory or works cost is represented by labour and materials of Australia and New Zealand.
      </para>
      <para>
       In August 1988 the further protocol on trade and services was entered into in which some sectors were excluded from the operation of CER, notably Australian Government monopolies and certain sectors where foreign ownership is a sensitive issue, including media and telecommunications.
      </para>
      <para>
       In July 1988 the memorandum of understanding on harmonisation of business law was entered into. This document, together with the memorandum of understanding on technical barriers to trade, provides that the next major review take place in 1992. The present measures under consideration with this Bill should really be seen as interim steps towards such harmonisation. In this sense, the Bill does not try to establish uniform laws between Australia and New Zealand in the area of competition or antimonopolistic provisions. This question will be addressed in the 1992 review, and I will say a little more about this in a moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn briefly to the terms of the protocol on the acceleration on free trade in goods. Article 4.1 of the protocol provides:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Member States agree that anti-dumping measures in respect of goods originating in the territory of the other Member State are not appropriate from the time of achievement of both free trade in goods between the Member States on 1 July 1990 and the application of their competition laws to relevant anti-competitive conduct affecting trans-Tasman trade in goods.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, article 4.5 allows for the 1 July starting date to be extended in the following terms-again it is necessary to quote it:
      </para>
      <para>
       In the event that either Member State cannot complete by 1 July 1990 the actions referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, it may inform the other Member State before 1 July 1990 that the application of paragraph 2 by the first Member State may be delayed. In that event the Member States may agree an alternative date for the application of paragraph 2 by the first Member State, such date being the earliest practicable, and the second Member State may decide whether it too will delay the application of paragraph 2 of this Article.
      </para>
      <para>
       Paragraph 2 of article 4 elaborates the actions that the two countries shall take to remove anti-dumping provisions. Article 4, of course, is concerned with the removal of anti-dumping action in the trans-Tasman market. Other articles of the protocol deal with the reduction of tariffs, article 1, the removal of import restrictions or tariff quotas, article 2, and the eradication of monopoly import arrangements affecting certain agricultural products, article 3. Article 5 provides that both Australia and New Zealand should review the operation of the CER agreement especially with a view to consolidating the CER agreement and the miscellany of protocols into one single agreement. I return to article 4 and, in particular, to the extension of time provision contained in paragraph 5 of article 4. The target date of 1 July 1990 and the question of the timing of this Bill are clearly crucial threshold question.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are some important differences in Australian and New Zealand law in the area of the regulation of anti-competitive practices. If a true free trade zone is to operate effectively, it is desirable that such differences do not exist. For this reason, we might be hesitant to see an imperfect regulatory model for free trade being set up and would ask the Government to consider exercising the extension of time provisions in article 4.5. However, in light of the review mechanisms for the operation of the new scheme, we will support the Government in its efforts to meet the target date of 1 July 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is now worth touching upon current events on the other side of the Tasman. We are advised that New Zealand has introduced legislation-the Commerce Law Reform Bill and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill-to mirror the Bill under consideration here. The New Zealand Commerce Law Reform Bill, as I understand it, attempts to reform the New Zealand equivalent of the Trade Practices Act in more general terms, but the Bill also has specific provisions which mirror or reflect those parts of this Bill which deal with the Trade Practices Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, we are advised that New Zealand is quite confident that the Bill will be passed by 1 July. At this stage, it has been referred to a select committee in the New Zealand Parliament. The Opposition spokesman on industry there has some concerns with the Bill in that the threshold level for the application of competition law is much lower in Australia than is the case in New Zealand. We on this side of the House also share that concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having painted a broad picture of what we appreciate the Bill is designed to achieve and the context in which it is to be understood, I will now focus on a few specific issues which warrant special mentioning. The first concerns timing and the importance of the 1 July target date. The Government has taken the attitude that rather than ensuring that there is a harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand laws or some uniformity between those laws, even in this narrow context of competition laws, it is simply best to get something on the board to work on. In this respect, the harmonisation review for 1992 would then look at the question of making the respective sets of laws uniform. Related to this question is the fact that there are some significant differences between the Australian and New Zealand competition provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to those competition provisions, upon the removal of anti-dumping measures, as I understand it, the only protection against predatory market practices by influential corporations will be the proposed trans-Tasman competition provisions. The effect of proposed section 46a will be to prohibit New Zealand corporations which have substantial market power from taking advantage of that power to eliminate or damage a competitor.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are two significant differences between the proposed section 46a of the Trade Practices Act and the New Zealand equivalent, section 36a of the Commerce Act. One of those differences is that the Australian provision has a test of `substantial degree of market power' whereas the New Zealand provision has the test, as I understand it, of `dominant position in a market'-which was the case, as I recall, with the Trade Practices Act until 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent Federal Court cases have established that substantial market power can mean as little as 30 per cent control of the market. I refer the House-in particular the Attorney-General-to the Federal Court's decision in Mark Lyons v. Bursill Sportsgear-1987 ATPR paragraph 40-809.
      </para>
      <para>
       This could have significant ramifications in the sense that it may be easier to substantiate a breach of the competition provisions in Australia than it is in New Zealand. This is illustrated by comparing the Australian Federal Court's decision in Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v. TPC (1989) A.T.P.R. para. 40-930 with the New Zealand High Court case of Magnum Corporation 1987 1 N.Z.B.L.C (Com) paras 99-500. Although both cases were concerned with the question of whether a merger would lead to the acquisition or strengthening of a market position or the misuse of market power, it is very clear that the Australian courts are interpreting this question as involving a lower threshold of market power. That is the first matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, proposed section 46a(7) allows the court to decide the question of the degree of market power by `inference from the conduct of the Corporation or of any other person or from other relevant circumstances', a provision that was also introduced in 1986. There is no equivalent provision in the proposed New Zealand Bill. This difference will obviously have an effect upon the conduct and presentation of future cases in the proposed trans-Tasman proceedings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The existing section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, which operates, of course, to regulate anti-competitive practices and the misuse of market power in the Australian marketplace, has been subject to some criticism in the past. This provision, together with section 50, dealing with the effects of the mergers, was the subject of review by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, oft times in the past referred to as the Griffiths Committee, the Chairman of that Committee now being a Minister. It was a House Committee established in 1988 to examine whether those provisions dealing with the misuse of market power and mergers are adequate for the Australian market conditions in the late 1980s.
      </para>
      <para>
       The review led to the tabling in May 1989 of a report entitled Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies: Profiting from Competition?. That report recognised the difficulties and inconsistencies that have arisen from the interpretation and application of section 46. One particular problem is proving that a corporation with substantial market power has `taken advantage' of that power.
      </para>
      <para>
       The High Court's decision in the Queensland Wire Industries case has helped to give some guidance on the application of section 46, and the Court particularly noted that the object of the section was to protect consumers by protecting the competitive process.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, there are still some uncertainties with the operation of the section, and this was recognised by the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) in its submission to the parliamentary Committee. The TPC recommended, amongst other things, that control of an `essential facility'-a doctrine, of course, recognised in America-be introduced as an alternative test to that of `substantial degree of market power'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst that Committee recommended that section 46 did not need to be amended at this present juncture, its final conclusion suggested that the Trade Practices Act should be subject to a general review by the Attorney-General's Department in 1994. It has been said that section 46 really has been an under-used provision, both in the sense of private litigation and in the context of intervention by the Trade Practices Commission. In an address to the Commercial Law Association given in March of 1989, the Trade Practices Commissioner, Professor Baxt, is reported to have said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The costs of litigation are, of course, quite significant and this is an issue that needs to be addressed in the context of legislation dealing especially with misuse of market power.
      </para>
      <para>
       Here, I think, lies the salient point. The cost and complexity of proceedings under section 46 and, by extension, the proposed section 46a deter its effective use by private parties. In that same address Professor Baxt noted some possible reforms to section 46 which had been submitted to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in order to make section 46 more accessible. He went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       One related issue on section 46 is closer economic relations. The removal of the Anti-Dumping legislation will have a major impact on the interpretation of Section 46 in my view, and the Trade Practices Commission will be working closely with the Attorney-General's Department in evaluating whether the current legislation will be effective in dealing with the problems that may be thrown up in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       With that in mind, I ask the Attorney whether that consultation did take place or, alternatively-and I doubt very much that this is the case-if consultation did occur, did a view arise that the existing provisions of section 46 are adequate, for in this sense the proposed section 46a merely reproduces the existing provisions of section 46? The Trade Practices Commissioner has been very vocal about the need for reform in this area and has suggested, amongst other things, the need for a specialist economic court in the trans-Tasman region.
      </para>
      <para>
       The comments made earlier were made to illustrate the point that section 46 is clearly in need of reform and, by extinction, there will be as a consequence a need to review proposed section 46a. Again, I ask the Attorney to examine this issue at the earliest possible time, with all the vigour and resources that I know he can muster on occasions. I do not say that lightly, and I must emphasise the importance of this point. If the competition provisions are to be the only form of protection against market abuse, it is essential for their effective operation that there be uniformity between the Australian and New Zealand versions.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer now to the financial impact. It is noted in the explanatory memorandum that the financial impact flowing from this legislation is $146,000, which includes the employment of two extra staff by the Trade Practices Commission. In relation to the increased jurisdiction given to the Federal Court and the pressure that this will have on its existing resources, it has been said that the Federal Court will be able to cope for the time being with its existing resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the past, the anti-dumping provisions have rarely been used in relation to trans-Tasman trade. Action under the anti-dumping regime has really been a cost borne by the public sector and not by the private sector. In essence, it involves Government or administrative action being taken to protect local industries. Weighed against this cost-which will be removed in the context of this Bill-is the cost of Federal Court litigation, under the proposed section 46a of the Trades Practices Act. Obviously, disputes involving competition laws are quite complex and will involve costly and lengthy proceedings for private parties.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General indicated that he will ask the Trade Practices Commission to be active in investigating complaints under proposed section 46a of the Trade Practices Act and to take into account the expense that complainants would incur if it were necessary, as private parties, to commence proceedings.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the past there has been some criticism that the Trade Practices Commission has not been active enough in investigating section 46 complaints in the Australian market. We welcome this renewed vigour once again displayed by the Attorney, but we also put on the record that we will expect him to keep his promise on this point and fulfil the expectations that he has created. I also hope that the pressure that may be placed as a consequence of these measures on existing Federal Court resources will also be closely examined and reviewed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to parts 6 and 7 of the Bill, which deal with the manner in which trans-Tasman proceedings against anti-competitive practices will be conducted. As I noted earlier in the outline that I gave of the Bill, amendments are to be made to the Evidence Act 1905 and the Federal Court Act 1975 to facilitate proceedings in cases, among others, where corporations are exercising market power in one country with adverse effects in the other. In such proceedings it will be necessary to obtain evidence in both countries and, accordingly, it is essential that existing procedures for litigation be tailored to meet the peculiar needs of such proceedings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendments to the Evidence Act are designed to allow the Federal Court to take judicial notice of the official status of a variety of New Zealand public documents. Those amendments are based on the provisions of the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901, which allows courts in one State to take judicial notice of the official status of public documents originating from another State. The amendments to the Federal Court Act are somewhat innovative, some of which include the admissibility of facsimile material, the giving of evidence or submissions in proceedings by way of telephone or video link, and allowing the Federal Court to conduct proceedings in New Zealand.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendments also allow for the reciprocal registration and enforcement of interim and final orders made by each court in trans-Tasman market proceedings, a feature which will be necessary to guarantee the effective operation of the new scheme. The amendments dealing with the trans-Tasman market proceedings should be commended as being both innovative and flexible. However, given that the amendments make some inroads into the best evidence rule, their future operation needs to be carefully monitored. I have already mentioned that, given this Bill puts forward an imperfect model for the regulation or overseeing of free trade in the trans-Tasman region, it is essential that its efficacy be closely monitored.
      </para>
      <para>
       The further review, the harmonisation review for 1992, reinforced by article 5 of the protocol, will take into account the operation of this scheme with a view to removing any differences in the competition provisions, and the regime for their enforcement, within the wider context of achieving uniformity in trans-Tasman business law.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, in his second reading speech the Attorney-General has undertaken to keep the new scheme under close review. In this respect, in such a review by the Attorney-General, it is important that both the costs and efficacy of the proposed regime for trans-Tasman proceedings against anti-competition practices be closely monitored. As far as the Opposition is concerned, it is crucial that the scheme be subject to future scrutiny with a view to ensuring that any remaining administrative or market impediments to free trade and open competition are identified and eradicated.
      </para>
      <para>
       In light of the matters I have raised the Opposition will support the Bill, but we do so trusting the Attorney-General will ensure the following: firstly, that it be clearly understood that the Bill is an interim measure fulfilling Australia's obligations under the protocol, and that it should be viewed within the wider context of the 1992 review on the harmonisation of trans-Tasman business laws; secondly, that the Government fulfil its promise that the Trade Practices Commission will take an active role in investigating complaints about anti-competitive practices in the trans-Tasman market, in order to alleviate or minimise the costs that would arise from private proceedings; and thirdly, that the Government will keep to its undertaking to closely monitor the efficacy of the new scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       Furthermore, I wish to emphasise the concerns we have with the fact that there are important differences between the Australian and New Zealand competition provisions, and it is essential that these differences be removed at the earliest possible time. I also wish to make it clear that we will closely monitor the scheme to ensure that it does, in fact, operate to best serve the promotion of free trade and open competition in the trans-Tasman market.

        â€”I rise in support of the Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill introduced by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on 9 May. This Bill is to strengthen free trade between the Australian and New Zealand economies by replacing weaker anti-dumping measures by the stronger Trade Practices Act.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Attorney-General has already outlined the provisions of this Bill in some detail, and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the philosophy underpinning it while speaking in support of his remarks. The Bill springs from two intermeshing historical processes which have been grasped by the Labor governments that have dominated the two nation states on each side of the Tasman for a decade: a recognition of their common historical heritage and a commitment to the value of free trade.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are probably no two other countries in the world whose peoples are so similar as those of Australia and New Zealand. It is a measure of their similarities that they can cast such peculiar aspersions on one another. We refer to the strange number they have between five and seven, which sounds like a cross between what people do on their honeymoon and what they take off their feet at night-socks. They glory in references to souls arriving here at Her Majesty's pleasure. An old academic colleague of mine used to boast that on his visits to Wellington it was the only time that he ever got honoured as an imperialist swine. It is only between two countries such as ours, surely, that an underarm bowler could occasion the major diplomatic incident of the last two decades.
      </para>
      <para>
       These trivialities spring from our familiarities in which traces of the unconsummated federation of 90 years ago still sparkle. During the post-war years both countries have grappled with very similar problems. In essence, neither could remain prosperous and protected components of the old British economic empire. In Australia some recognition of this fact led to a vigorous post-war reconstruction program under the then Labor Government. Unfortunately, much of the vigours of this program were dissipated during the next 30 years by the dirigism of the coalition regime. Honourable members opposite may note that `dirigism' means, according to the last economic dictionary that I consulted, a `planned economy' economic planning and controlled  finance'.
      </para>
      <para>
       During this time, industrial growth in Australia languished while real post-war reconstruction occurred in Europe and North East Asia. The dissimilarity in these two processes was disguised by the substantial export growth during the 1960's for minerals and the phenomenal economic miracle that was the Japanese economy; and then in the 1970's by the temporary rise in the price of our commodity exports caused by the momentarily successful Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel. The only occasion during those three decades when a serious commitment to the establishment of an economically efficient economy based on market mechanisms and free trade was undertaken by an Australian government was during the Labor Government of 1972-75. As a result, our domestic secondary industrial structure languished into what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the other day called-and I believe that this is a technical term-a spittoon.
      </para>
      <para>
       The New Zealand experience was similar and, indeed, may have been even worse. A blind refusal to recognise reality led to its forlorn attempt to cling to a special relationship with the United Kingdom market of which it had become an adjunct when that country entered the European Community in 1973. This was followed by nearly a decade of very badly lost opportunities and rising debt under the neo-Stalinist state planner Piggy Muldoon.
      </para>
      <para>
       By the early 1980s both countries were in an economic crisis of inflation, unemployment and debt caused by a generation of governments which mouthed the platitudes of free enterprise but practiced the realities of external protection, state subsidies and regulatory interventions for their mates. This was the crisis this government and its trans-Tasman counterpart faced in the early 1980's. We were both becoming, as Lee Kuan Yew expressed so colourfully, `the poor white trash of Asia'. Both economies had to be reconstituted on a more productive base which was internationally competitive. This Labor Government, led by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is the first since Whitlam's to have a commitment to the free market and the first to last long enough to implement that philosophy.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is true that the Australian Labor Party, myself included, has not always been as deeply committed to national economic efficiency and free trade as is being expressed at this time. But on each of the two occasions that it has been in office during the period since 1949 it has had to confront the reality that a featherbedded uncompetitive industrial structure will not support the programs of equity, welfare and opportunity that our supporters aspire to and our citizens deserve.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should not be necessary for me to point out-and therefore I will not-to an Opposition led by such a distinguished economist that market based economies have outpaced those which were plan based over the last 40 years. We can all say, as it says in the first paragraph of any economic text book, that `the market distributes labour and capital to an equilibrium where the marginal rate of return is equalised'. Even I can say that. The point is not to say it but actually to implement it.

        â€”I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his commendation. Unfortunately, if the market is implemented in its totality this leads to excessive and unnecessary want and exploitation within a market based economy. Labor has and will prevent such consequences. However, as a party we have recognised that the efficiencies and dynamism of the market can be unleased in those sectors of the economy where we need them. That is the purpose that we have expressed during the last seven years which is one of the reasons why economic growth and rising living standards for the majority of the population have been substantially quicker under Hawke Labor than under Fraser Liberal.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This Bill recognises that the philosophy of competition and efficiency has two components-an external and an internal component. The closer economic relations trade agreement with New Zealand is the regional manifestation of the international free trade regime which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has sought to pursue for the last 40 years. The GATT regime has, it must be recognised, enabled the fastest rate of economic growth that the world economic system has ever achieved.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, it is not perfect. It is still riddled with a number of international trade malpractices, the most notable of which is dumping-which is why GATT has an international dumping code designed to prevent dumping. However, we all know that that has not stopped the practice, as experienced by the major trading regions of North America, East Asia and the European Community. The practice is not all upside; it has the downside of very considerable economic distortions within these economic blocks, as anyone who has tried to eat meat in Japan will know.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has tried to pursue the internationalisation of the Australian economy and a reduction in protection, in the sure knowledge that the benefits in the form of growth and efficiencies which result from these processes will occur during a period of readjustment, which involves some pain. The New Zealand Government has been pursuing a similar course involving even more pain, because the equivalent readjustment requirement has been greater. Economic unification will assist this process, just as European Community unification in 1992 is expected to produce it itself as a single act a 6 per cent growth in economic output. It is foolhardy to believe that the merger of an economy of 17 countries and 3.5 million peoples would lead to such an accelerated spurt but, nonetheless, some acceleration may be expected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Domestically, the Government has been pursuing a corresponding course of liberalisation that accords to that of an earlier Labor Government in the 1970s which reduced tariffs, attacked business collusion in the Trade Practices Commission, addressed monopolistic pricing practices in the Prices Justification Tribunal, and tried to free up the banking and financial system.
      </para>
      <para>
       As these two economies become one trans-Tasman unit, the question arises of how to deal properly with market distortions in a manner to maximise public benefit. The international practice of dumping becomes, as these two economies merge, the domestic practice of business collusion. Adam Smith, widely recognised as a major theoretician of international free trade, expressed business collusion in his classic Wealth of Nations in the following way:
      </para>
      <para>
       People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion -
      </para>
      <para>
       and they do-
      </para>
      <para>
       but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Adam Smith was very pessimistic about being able to do anything about this. The well known quotation which I have just read, in a lesser known form, continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Trade Practices Act has tried to do just what Adam Smith says is impossible. It might be said that that Act and its implementation has not always been successful. Only last month friends of mine in a business house complained to me that the house had been ousted from a discount purchasing group as a result of a number crunching conspiracy-about which honourable members on this side of the House would know very little. But it seems that these kinds of practices are very difficult to prove. On this occasion my friends are going out of business and the prices are being maintained high in that sector of the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Trade Practices Commission does have, on my observation, a better record of enforcement than the international anti-dumping arrangements, as our primary producers, whose representatives seem to have left the House, know only too well. This instrument is now being commended to the House as the appropriate weapon for enforcing the benefits of freedom of commerce onto the population of these two great sister countries and against the contrivance of those who might resist.
      </para>
      <para>
       In short, this Bill is a necessary adjunct to our closer economic relations trade agreement in order to maximise the benefits of fusing two economies with such similar political and cultural heritages. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

        â€”I am always happy to speak on a Bill, any piece of legislation, that is about bringing Australia and New Zealand closer together in an economic sense. I am happy to speak on the Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill, and in general terms I am in support of it. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has outlined very clearly the details of the legislation as we see them from this side of the House. Suffice it for me to say that what it does is implement the protocol to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement on Acceleration of Free Trade in Goods of August 1988 by amending a number of Australian Acts-the Trade Practices Act, an anti-dumping authority Act, the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, the Evidence Act, the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act, and so on.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This legislation has, of course, been brought in with a good deal of haste, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong, and as a result we have not been able as a Parliament and, indeed, nationally to give it as much consideration as one might otherwise have liked. The honourable member for Kooyong raised a number of points in that context, and we look forward to hearing the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) respond to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       One very important aspect-I suppose it is the critical aspect-of the legislation is the way it removes anti-dumping laws and replaces them with anti-competitive activity which will be prosecuted under competition laws. Noteworthy is the difference between New Zealand's dominant market power clause and our substantial market power clause. I remind the House that New Zealand's dominant market power clause means something in the vicinity of an 80 per cent share of the market, whereas in Australia the substantial market power clause has been defined as little as 30 per cent. We on this side of the House look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in terms of a clarification of the two different definitions within the two countries' legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that, I do not want to sound mean about the legislation and its broad objectives because, as I said at the outset, I am always happy to support legislation and debates in support of closer economic relations (CER) between Australia and New Zealand and that is certainly what this legislation is about.
      </para>
      <para>
       Instinctively I would have to say that my personal preference is always for multilateral liberalisation of trading arrangements rather than for the establishment and hastening of trading blocs. I have a deal of concern about the way the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, about which the Attorney-General knows only too well, is moving very slowly. If it moves too slowly and is not sufficiently successful we will see the evolution of trading blocs to a greater degree than we have already.
      </para>
      <para>
       Closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand fall more comfortably within the rules of GATT and I do not see it in that sense, therefore, as the evolution of some sort of trading bloc as such. On the contrary, I think this is a natural evolution of a relationship between two countries which in the first place have a great deal of history in common and, secondly, have a great deal of common cultural experience. Also, Australia and New Zealand have been rapidly moving together economically, particularly since the advent of closer economic relations. It is worth reminding ourselves that New Zealand is now Australia's third largest export market after Japan and the United States, taking some 5.1 per cent of out total exports. Interestingly, New Zealand is the largest market for Australian manufactured goods.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the other side of the ledger, Australia is one of New Zealand's three largest export markets, with Japan and the United States, and we take something in the vicinity of 15 or 16 per cent of New Zealand exports. As those figures indicate, this is already an important relationship. Within the progressive liberalisation under the closer economic relations arrangements, the relationship has rapidly become much closer. It is worth pointing out that since the implementation of the CER arrangements trade between Australia and New Zealand has more than doubled, totalling almost $4.5 billion last year.

       During this debate it is probably worth our while reflecting on where we think the relationship will go from now, because on 1 July the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Palmer, will be in Australia and he and the present Federal Government will be sitting down to consider what further steps can be taken in developing this economic relationship. I tend to agree with the New Zealanders that any discussions, as there are sometimes in the media, about some kind of political union between Australia and New Zealand are fanciful and we can do more constructive things than sit around talking about something that I suspect will never happen in my lifetime.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that there is a good deal of resistance to the proposition in New Zealand. The New Zealanders continually say that they do not like our Federal system. They continually and understandably emphasise that they like to be an independent and proud country on their own. I do not think that any discussion of political union in Australia is a constructive way of looking at this relationship.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I have been interested more recently in some of the debate about how we can move towards greater economic and monetary cooperation. Some people have suggested that a time may come when we can move towards economic and monetary union with New Zealand. That is a big debate within the European community and is something that it is taking steps towards but, in the case of the Australian and New Zealand relationship, the volume of bilateral trade between the two countries is still too small at this stage for us to seriously contemplate a true economic and monetary union. I think it is too premature for us to be talking in great detail about that with the New Zealanders.
      </para>
      <para>
       Others have suggested that we should be moving towards a customs union with New Zealand. If we were to try to do that in an official sense we might find ourselves up against quite a number of difficulties. But the process of reducing the level of protection in Australia and the more dramatic process of doing the same thing in New Zealand is in any case leading towards the establishment of a de facto customs union. It is not, if you like, strictly speaking a customs union, but an arrangement where levels of protection in both our countries will be very close to each other. As I have pointed out, the consequences will be something along the lines of a de facto customs union.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think what we really need to do is build in a more practical way on the progress we have made. One of the areas where I think we need to do a great deal more is in developing a free trade in services between our two countries. The Attorney-General, who is at the table, will well remember the trade in services agreement signed between Australia and New Zealand in August 1988, along with the other protocols of closer economic relations (CER) to which this Bill relates, of course. One of the concerns I have about that arrangement is the way provision was made in the agreement for the exclusion of a whole range of services-not a permanent exclusion but certainly for the time being an exclusion. A number of inscriptions, as they are called, were drawn up. That is the way the exclusions were handled under the protocol of the time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The services which are inscribed are largely areas of popular debate within Australia at the moment. They are areas where we on this side of the House are calling for what is described as micro-economic reform. They are areas, for example, where there is a significant degree of Government monopoly or where there are what are described as public interest regulations. I am not suggesting we do not support any public interest regulation in the area of broadcasting, but the fact is that they are areas where there is an inscription and therefore where the evolution of services trade between our two countries is inhibited.
      </para>
      <para>
       The New Zealand list of inscriptions, let me point out, is a very short list and a list that is becoming increasingly shorter. By contrast, the Australian list is rather a long list: telecommunications, banking, airport services, domestic air services, coastal shipping, construction engineering and general consultancy-although I think some of that has actually fallen out since the signing of the protocol-broadcasting and television, and a whole range of other smaller areas of economic activity. If we are serious about really developing the CER process-and I am sure on both sides of the House we are serious about doing that-then this is one area where we have to open up the market in order to make that relationship all the richer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point in terms of the evolution of the relationship that needs to be given careful consideration is the area of taxation. It is worth noting that the discrepancies in the taxation systems of the two countries, which are very substantial, will act as a de facto inhibition on the evolution of our trade. For example, New Zealand has a company tax rate of 33 per cent; Australia has a company tax of 39 per cent, which partially explains why there has been an enormous upsurge in Australian investment in New Zealand. The change in investment flows has proportionately not been so great in the other direction. That is something we need to be talking to the New Zealanders about and considering within the framework of our own taxation system.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also worth noting-it is a controversial thing to note in these days of debate on these issues-that New Zealand has a goods and services tax whereas we, by way of indirect taxation, have a wholesale sales tax. Our wholesale sales tax differs substantially in its effect on exports from the New Zealand goods and services tax because the New Zealand tax exempts exports altogether from the application of indirect taxation. I remind the House that our wholesale sales tax collects something like 10 per cent of its revenue from exports. These are very approximate, back of the envelope figures. That constitutes about $1 billion of Commonwealth revenue collected from the effect of the wholesale sales tax on exports, which adds about 2 per cent to the cost of Australian exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst New Zealand, is exporting these goods and services sales tax-free, Australia is exporting goods in the other direction to New Zealand, many of which have been subject to the wholesale sales tax. So that puts us at a competitive disadvantage with New Zealand that we need to consider fairly carefully.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am running out of time and I know that one of my colleagues wants to participate in this debate as well, so in conclusion I simply say that I have a great deal of personal affection for New Zealand. I feel very strongly about the historical and cultural identity link between the two countries and I hope that we can continue to build on the successes of closer economic relations, particularly from now on in the services area, having been pretty successful in breaking down the barriers in the trade in goods. But we should not be constructing debates in Australia on this issue which are simply unrealistic. I do not think that we will have political union. I do not think that is an important part of the debate. When we talk about economic and monetary union, that has to be handled also with great care because we are not quite at the level of reality at which that could be implemented.

        â€”The Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill both result primarily from the Government's free trade agreement with New Zealand. For the benefit of the House I will give a little background to this agreement. Australia's trade agreement was first negotiated with New Zealand in 1983 and renegotiated in 1988 with an agreement minute on industry assistance being signed in August of that year. The initial 1983 agreement arose out of a desire of both countries for a closer working relationship based on a common language, a shared tradition of democratic government and a record of cooperation and trade patterns which would be beneficial for each other's markets.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, entered into on 1 April 1983, provided as the first step towards these closer economic relations a framework for the progressive and automatic introduction of a full free trade area between the two countries. In achieving this free trade area the agreement addressed such issues as competitive opportunities, export incentives and trade practices. The 1983 agreement was successful, contributing substantially to the doubling of trans-Tasman trade between 1983 and 1987. Many of the liberalisation provisions outlined in the agreement were implemented ahead of schedule.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given this success the Australian and New Zealand governments in 1987 set about reviewing the agreement. In July 1988 the two Prime Ministers signed a new agreement, a revised Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, known as the ANZCERTA agreement, which outlined a comprehensive new package of arrangements. Essentially, these new arrangements accelerated the implementation of the free trade in goods up to 1 July 1990, abolished anti-dumping provisions and permitted trade in services within defined areas. A further review of this agreement is scheduled for 1992. The new ANZCERTA agreement should be of considerable benefit to consumers in that prices should go down because of increased competition and greater product choice. Producers will benefit through free access to new markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat the coalition's already on-the-record general support for the principle of trans-Tasman free trade and the ANZCERTA agreement. The bulk of the legislation putting the new agreement into effect has already been passed through the House. Indeed, I understand that these two Bills should be among the last to be considered in relation to the agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Against this background I would like to comment on the Bills being debated. In fact I would like to confine my comments primarily to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. This Bill proposes a number of amendments to various customs bounty Acts. Most of the amendments arise out of the ANZCERTA agreement. However, a couple are of a more technical nature. Specifically, this Bill amends the Bounty (Books) Act, the Bounty (Computers) Act, the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act and the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act to prohibit the payment of bounty on equipment or goods produced and which will be exported either directly or indirectly through another country to New Zealand.
      </para>
      <para>
       In line with the ANZCERTA agreement, this Bill provides that bounty will cease on 1 July 1990. A concern arising out of this legislation relates to goods which are exported but which may be sent to those international markets through New Zealand, that is, goods which are either transshipped through New Zealand or are off-loaded in New Zealand for distribution to other South Pacific nations. For example, a number of producers of educational books send their produce to international markets via New Zealand. In some cases, they are off-loaded, stored in a warehouse and then at a later date sent on to countries in the South Pacific. There was some cause for concern that, because the books were to be distributed from New Zealand, bounty would not be payable. Consequently, I was reassured to hear the Minister state in his second reading speech:
      </para>
      <para>
       That desired prohibition on bounty will not however extend to goods exported through New Zealand to other destinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In attempting to clarify the exact meaning and extent of the Minister's statement, I have been advised by his department that only those goods which actually enter the New Zealand marketplace and economy will be exempt from bounty. Therefore, goods passing through New Zealand on route to another destination will still be eligible for bounty.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second part of the Bill makes a number of technical amendments to existing bounty Acts, generally the result of omissions in the initial drafting of the legislation. There are two changes in particular that I would like to bring to the attention of the House. The Bounty (Ships) Act, as it currently stands, provides that only those direct material costs incurred by the shipbuilder for goods actually incorporated in the vessel or in its modification are eligible for bounty. Consequently, a number of costs for consumables incurred by the producer are not eligible costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed amendment by the Government corrects this anomaly and will allow the costs of certain consumables actually used in the process of constructing and modifying a vessel to be eligible costs for the purposes of calculating bounty. Such consumables, including welding gases, welding rods and grinding discs, are consumables relevant only to the job being undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other significant amendment is to the Bounty (Books) Act. Currently, full bounty is not payable on the production run of a particular book until all the books in that production run have been bound-which is regarded as the final point in the production process. This presents a problem for many producers, who may bind and put onto the market a portion of the production run and keep the remainder in storage until a later date. In some cases, the remainder of the production run may not be bound for up to two years, delaying payment of bounty.
      </para>
      <para>
       This amendment will provide for producers to submit claims for bounty as each batch is bound. In other words, bounty on the whole production run can be claimed more frequently and in smaller amounts rather than in one lump sum once all the production run has been bound. The amendment should have the additional benefit of discouraging the practice of producers undertaking a number of separate, small production runs of the same book in order to obtain earlier and more frequent payments of bounty when, in other circumstances, one bigger production run would be more appropriate. Given the Coalition's support for the ANZCERTA agreement and the technical nature of the remaining amendments, we are prepared to support this particular Bill.

         â€”We have had a cognate debate involving the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill 1990. I think in the context of some of the debates that take place in this House, it would have been interesting for people to hear the contributions tonight from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), particularly on the Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill. Various matters were raised by the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Mayo which I think do require an answer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, in terms of the constraints on time, I will respond to one particular matter which caused some concern to the honourable member for Kooyong and which relates to the proposal in respect of the necessary amendments which may have been put forward at the suggestion of Professor Baxt in relation to section 46. The position now has changed a little in that the Trade Practices Commission was involved as a member of the working party in the formulation of this Bill. In the context of Professor Baxt's comments in March 1989, referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong, those comments have been superseded by a review by the Trade Practices Commission of how it planned to enforce section 46 following the Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd case, which was also referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong. The result of that review was the provision of a guideline on the workings of section 46, in line with Professor Baxt no longer calling for a review of that section 46. This accords with the view of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Griffiths Committee, which was the other point that the honourable member for Kooyong took up.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will summarise four particular matters that the honourable member for Kooyong referred to. Firstly, he made the point that it should be understood that this Bill is an interim measure fulfilling our obligation under the protocol and that it should be viewed within the wider context of the 1992 review. That is accepted on this side of the House. The second point related to the promise that the TPC will take an active role in investigating complaints in an attempt to minimise the cost that would arise from private proceedings. I will deal with that in more detail in a moment. There is no difficulty with that on this side of the house. Thirdly, he said that the efficacy of the new scheme should be closely monitored. We agree with that proposal. Fourthly, the honourable member had concerns about the differences between the Australian and New Zealand competition provisions. That matter has to be dealt with in the context of the ongoing review relating to the issue of the harmonisation of business laws. In that context that matter will be kept under scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of the detail of some of those matters, and touching on the point of the differences, both the Australian and New Zealand officials have endeavoured to establish as far as possible a complementary scheme for the implementation of their obligation under article 4 to the trade agreement on the acceleration of trade in goods. But it must be remembered that article 4, referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong, requires only that Australia and New Zealand apply their competition laws to relevant anti-competitive conduct affecting trans-Tasman trade in goods. There is no requirement that the relevant competition laws be uniform-not that that was a suggestion that the honourable member was putting forward, but the differences concerned him.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been necessary for both Australia and New Zealand to adapt their existing laws, which are differently drafted and in many cases are different in substance. Both the Australian and New Zealand provisions are based on similar existing misuse of market power provisions in their competition legislation. The honourable member for Kooyong dealt in some detail with the important point about the threshold test as a matter of greater concern to New Zealand business than to Australian business because the threshold is higher in New Zealand. This is one of the matters which I mentioned earlier which will be kept under consideration in the wider Australia-New Zealand discussions on the harmonisation of business laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Experience with the operation of the new provisions, particularly the way in which the Australian and New Zealand courts apply the provisions, will indicate how much more harmonisation is necessary of the Australian and New Zealand legislation. I think that that is a matter which, in the circumstances that we are in at the moment with the acceleration of the free trade in goods, is obviously going to be kept under close scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time available the other issue I would like to touch on is the question of the matters being dealt with by the Trade Practices Commission. It is true that business and industry groups have expressed concerns to the Government about the potential cost burden that the new scheme, particularly with its need for trans-Tasman investigations, will place on members of industry particularly. It is understood that these concerns arise because anti-dumping actions are an administrative matter with investigative costs largely being borne by the public sector. For the future, protection from trans-Tasman predatory conduct will be afforded by those new provisions, in particular, proposed new section 46a. The enforcement of proposed new section 46a will be a matter for private parties or for the Trade Practices Commission through the courts system. That was one of the four points that the honourable member has raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        As mentioned in the second reading speech, we as a government do propose to address these industry concerns in two ways. First, the Government will ask the Trade Practices Commission when it considers whether it should investigate a complaint under proposed new section 46a to be sympathetic to, and to take full account of, the expense and difficulties that would be involved if the complainant, rather than the Commission, had to take action in regard to the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        As will be appreciated, the final decision whether to proceed in a particular matter rests properly with the Trade Practices Commission. However, it is our view that the enforcement action under proposed new section 46a by the Commission is a central element in the creation and maintenance of a competitive trans-Tasman market. I emphasise that I think it is a point of considerable significance that we, as a government, ask the Trade Practices Commission to look at the problem and be sympathetic to, and take full account of, the problems, particularly from the point of view of the expense involved, if a complainant, rather than the Trade Practices Commission, took the action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, in light of industry concerns, steps have been taken to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission will be adequately resourced to carry out its functions under the trans-Tasman provisions of the Trade Practices Act. It is difficult to be exact about that at this stage; that is, it is not possible to be too sure of what the work load will be and what will happen in respect of the work load of the Commission under the new scheme, particularly in view of the fact that the number of trans-Tasman anti-dumping cases has not been great in recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, as indicated, an initial step has been to provide additional resources to the Commission in the form of two extra staff and funding of $146,000 a year. This funding will be kept under constant review and increased if necessary, because it is central to this proposal that the Trade Practices Commission is able to carry out the role that was referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kooyong raised quite a few other detailed matters that I will advise him about as soon as possible because I do not have time to deal with them now. I think I have covered the main matters he raised. The honourable member for Mayo referred to some matters not being important in the relationship between Australia and New Zealand or being matters which ought to be treated with care. From my own point of view, I do not disagree with the way he categorised those. The questions of currency and political union were two of the matters he mentioned. I just cannot recollect the others. The way he categorised them-not important, and ought to be treated with care-I do not disagree with.

        The amendments passed by the Senate make a number of changes to the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990, introduced a few days ago into this chamber. The changes are minor amendments. One changes the title `Parliamentary officer' to `Parliamentary office-holders'. The changes delete the provision that was intended to provide a statutory waiver in support of the validation provision in clause 8 so that the Minister for Finance would not have been required to waive purported overpayments of entitlements which, prior to this legislation, had not been covered either directly or indirectly by legislation.

        Most importantly, and the matter of most interest to honourable members in this debate, has been the decision to change the postage entitlements from the levels determined by the Government; that is $30,982 for a member and $9,462 for a senator. These have been amended back to $9,000, which was the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal in 1988. I am advised that at this stage 80 members of this House overspent the $9,000.

Further, the amendment deletes the proposed amendment to the Remuneration Tribunal Act so that the Tribunal, of its own volition, can decide to vary or omit benefits which have been determined by the Parliament. In the Government's view this outcome is not desirable. We feel that the Tribunal should not be expanded to cover such items which are clearly of a non-remuneration nature and which have not been within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction in its 17 years of existence.

       <para>
        I really want to make only two points in the short time that I have in the debate. They arise from the latest twist or about-face that the Government has taken on this matter. Yesterday the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, informed the Senate that on Monday, 14 May, he had received further oral advice from the Attorney-General's Department saying there was no obligation on parliamentarians to repay the moneys in question. It is worth quoting the exact words. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice that I have had-and I must say that, though verbal, it is emphatic-from the Attorney-General's Department is that members of parliament who have expended more than $9,000 during this financial year could not be made to pay back the extra over $9,000 up to $30,000. I am informed that the money will have to be met either by government or by Australia Post to which government has actually made these payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, as I said, the advice was verbal but emphatic. Of course, as with all legal advice, it has to be taken seriously.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        It says very clearly, first, that the money cannot be recovered from members of parliament, no matter what side of the Parliament they are on and, secondly, that the only organisation from which government may have a right to recover it would be Australia Post.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have a particular sense of deja vu regarding these comments, as we have heard the Government take a similar approach on a number of occasions. How many times have we heard the Government rely on this spurious argument? The former Minister used it. He kept saying, `It does not matter what the High Court decided; I have got some legal advice. You just spend, spend, spend'.

        </para>
       </talk.start>

        However it may be desirable that when Parliament resumes that specific appropriation for that purpose be included in the relevant appropriation bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        The then Minister chose to ignore these parts of the advice and, in doing so, misled parliamentarians at the time of the election campaign. Now we hear the present Minister saying, `Well, the increased allowance may be unlawful but the expenditure of moneys pursuant to such an unlawful determination of the Executive does not give rise to a liability to repay'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have touched upon whether there would be an obligation to repay. The honourable member for Menzies ought to say something on this as he has been so vigilant as a litigant, the plaintiff, on this issue. We take the view that there is a debt due and owing to the Commonwealth. That debt is owed by parliamentarians who spent public moneys in excess of the $9000 amount determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. It appears that the Government may accept this proposition although it is unclear, as there is a further twist to the story. Reports in today's press suggest that the Federal Government-and I refer to the report in the Australian-`expects the Minister for Finance to use his powers under the Audit Act to waive the repayment by many MPs of up to $21,500 is overspent postal allowances'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Frankly, that is scandalous. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is here. He is paying not one whit of attention to the reality that he is going to do this fiddle. At every step of the way there has been a fiddle. The Government misinterprets, deliberately or otherwise, legal advice, ignores decisions of the High Court, and the Government now says that, even if the money should not have been paid, `We will let the Minister for Finance waive that'. It is quite outrageous, to put it mildly.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there were a suggestion that members of the public had unlawfully spent public moneys, unquestionably the Government would claim that it had to pursue the matter through the courts. But this Labor Government thinks it is above the law. It thinks that it does not have to worry about these sorts of things. Why does it not admit its wrongdoing and come clean? Why does it think that politicians should be treated differently from other people?
       </para>
       <para>
        On the day of the High Court's decision, the Prime Minister said that the Government would do the `right thing'. Quite the reverse has occurred. With respect to the suggestion that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) can waive the debt in question, having regard to the relevant provisions of the Audit Act, which speaks of the power of the Minister to waive `irrecoverable debts and overpayments', I note two things. First there can be no suggestion that this debt is irrecoverable in a practical or legal sense and, secondly, the provision in question assumes that the moneys spent unlawfully have been appropriated in the first place. There are strong suggestions by the High Court that in fact the moneys for the increased allowance were never expended again. Perhaps the Government can throw some light on its intentions with respect to this?
       </para>
       <para>
        These brief comments show just how little the Government understands the Hight Court's decision in Brown v. West, a decision which was five-love in the plaintiff's favour.

         â€”The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has accurately and completely stated the Opposition's position on the Senate's amendments to the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill. There is no need to go into any great detail. The amendments that are now part of the Bill were fully canvassed in the Senate. Honourable members who are interested in following the details can read the Senate Hansard. At one stage this matter appeared in the Senate Hansard under the heading `Therapeutic Goods Regulations'. That seems to be appropriate, seeing that the Government has probably joined the walking wounded on this matter. It is appropriate that the matter should be among regulations dealing with walking sticks and crutches, as the Government has really adopted one crutch after another as it limps along the way to almost complete defeat in this matter. However, as I say, honourable members can read the Senate debate on this matter and see the motives behind the individual amendments that were incorporated in the Bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is appropriate to record for the benefit of this House some brief remarks in respect of some of the clauses. Amendment No. 6 seeks to delete clause 8 (2). I share the sentiment expressed by Senator Macklin in debate in the Senate that he was rather displeased that subclause (2) should be taken out of the Bill because he was dying to hear the Government's explanation as to what it meant, if anything. I do not know whether I have ever seen a clause in a Bill expressed in such labyrinthine gobbledegook that it almost did not mean anything at all. However, that provision is now not there and we need not trouble ourselves about that any more.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it was apparent from the verbiage of that subclause that it was part of the tricky armoury being adopted by the Government in this Bill, and we are probably better off without that sort of trickiness. There has been enough trickiness already in this whole matter without cluttering the thing up with more.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, it should be noted that clause 8 (1) is still in the Bill. Of course, that is the retrospective provision but, as a result of the Senate amendment to change the appropriate amount from $30,000 in part 1 of schedule 1 to $9,000, the retrospective validation is, of course, only to the extent of $9,000. In substance, members may spend $9,000 only lawfully and then, if I might put it this way, the Government is back where it started off because the matter will now have to go to the Remuneration Tribunal, which is what the Government should have done right from the very beginning. The Government will be back at first base, as it were, and I wish it well in following the course it should have adopted many months ago. Its reputation would be less tarnished than it is now had it followed the proper course from that time. In substance, the Government is back where it started.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should also be said that amendment No. 7 means-assuming that the original clause meant what the Government said it meant, which I have always thought was doubtful-in substance that for the balance of the 1989-90 year members are able to spend lawfully only up to $9,000 and not lawfully up to $30,892, which was the case before the amendment. In many senses amendment No. 7 is a benchmark provision which embodies in its own terms the overall result of this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, amendment No. 12 deserves particular reference, and that is an amendment to the schedule. In effect, it does a favour for Government members because it preserves some of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal which I can only assume, on the basis of not having read the Bill, the Government was prepared to bring to an end.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government members do not seem to realise that the Bill was proposing that the Remuneration Tribunal would have no further discretion to deal with other entitlements when it was looking at salaries. The Government really was-and I used the analogy in the previous debate-like turkeys voting for an early Christmas by denying itself the opportunity of getting reasonable provisions from the Remuneration Tribunal. The Government will always do better out of the Remuneration Tribunal than out of Senator Bolkus-I can guarantee that-but it needed the Opposition to tell the Government.

       <para>
        I want to reinforce the point made by the honourable member for Kooyong with respect to the next scandal looming up over the horizon, because it is true that there is a discretion given to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in the Audit Act to stop wasting money by the use of good money chasing bad money. Obviously, we do not want the Minister for Finance wasting our hard-earned taxes by chasing bad debts, and that is embodied in the Audit Act. The reality of this situation is that the Government is doing something which is quite baseless, because it is trying to tie up the exercise of that discretion by the Minister for Finance in advance. When it comes before a court-and, who knows, it might come before a court-we might even find out, five-love with or without costs, as the case may be, that it was not a proper exercise of his discretion. Then the Government really will have something to conjure with. If the Government wants more free advice I suggest that it looks at this very closely before it starts hobbling off on another crooked road towards yet another disaster.

       <para>
        Finally, may I say that one can summarise this whole matter in a very few words by saying, first of all, that the Government's conduct in this matter from beginning to end was conceived in greed to help itself to taxpayer's money which clearly was intended to be used for blatant political purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at some of the letters sent out by Labor Party members during the election campaign we see that they were not by any stretch of the imagination legitimate electoral material. They were highly polemic, had lots of bad grammar in them and were clearly used for political purposes.

         â€”Oddly enough some of those that were sent out were sent out by Labor members of parliament who are fortunately not with us any longer. But they were conceived in greed and clearly used for political purposes. Secondly, the whole conduct of the Government in this matter was based on an illegality which was drawn to the Government's notice. It was advised to be prudent and careful. The Government ignored this advice. Today we have seen the result of its ignoring that advice to be prudent.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the Government's whole attitude from beginning to end at every step of this unhappy story has been coloured by an attitude which can only be described as arrogance. When we say that it was acting illegally it encouraged people to ignore what we said. That is one point. When the High Court of Australia said it acted illegally the Government encouraged people to ignore the High Court. When it received advice that it was acting wrongly it said, `Well, it doesn't matter; let's just go on and ignore it'.

       <para>
        There has never been any apology, withdrawal or explanation as to why it embarked on this twisted and contorted exercise and the calculated way it embarked upon ripping money out of the taxpayer for political purposes. The people will remember that the Government has never apologised and never given any decent explanation for what it has been doing. It must be said that the Opposition was right from the very beginning. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), in adopting the position he maintained, particularly in supporting me, was absolutely right from beginning to end and I give him the credit that he deserves on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Government's attempt to pervert the discretionary power of the Minister for Finance that is coming up over the horizon is absolutely disgraceful. I end on the note that I struck halfway through my remarks: the Government would be very wise to look very carefully at this before it does anything more as silly and stupid as it has been doing from beginning to end of this whole matter.

        â€”I am not going to detain the House at this late hour to repeat what I have said on other occasions when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has been giving indications as to the conduct of business in the House, but let me just say two things. The first is to repeat that I believe that it is scandalous that this Parliament will only sit for some 34 or 35 days this year according to the schedule that has been circulated by the Government. If it maintains that schedule as I have said on previous occasions, it will be the shortest sitting period for about 50 years. I believe that the Government should review the sitting pattern, and if it does bring the House back the week after next, it should bring it back for a full week and not just for one day, as it has done on at least one previous occasion, to deal with matters coming back from the Senate.

        â€”in reply-I do appreciate the concern that the Opposition Manager of Business has for the conduct of the House. It makes it very difficult to make partisan political points against him as he is so decent, but I make the point that if one actually looks at the proposed sitting patterns for the end of the year-and I do take on board the points he makes-they are pretty normal. Whilst he does argue that this is going to be a fairly short sitting year, its brevity lies in the position that we have found ourselves in the first half of the year.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The second half of the year constitutes a normal sitting pattern in the experience of this Government and previous governments. Under that normal sitting pattern, when reflected in the two portions of the year in which we do sit, we have sat at least the days on which previous governments have brought this House together since virtually time immemorial and certainly since before the lifetime of most of us in this place. So I think that the days that he keeps quoting need to be viewed in that context. If it is looked at like that, it does not seem quite as bad as he feels constrained to pray.

         â€”I rise to speak on a matter of fundamental importance to my electorate, and that matter, of course, is the third runway. Since Cabinet's decision last year pending the outcome of the environmental impact statement (EIS), I have held two strong views: first, that with a fair EIS it will not come to pass; and, second, that such is the array of powerful vested interests in the private sector, the media and, particularly, the aviation bureaucracy, maintaining an even and fair playing field for that EIS was always going to be very difficult. Unfortunately, my worst fears appear to have been substantiated.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Tonight in the House I bring a document which is a copy of a letter from T. W. Crow Associates to Mr Brian Armstrong of the Federal Airports Corporation dated 2 June 1989. It concerns the selection of consultants to conduct the environmental impact statement into Sydney's third runway. It summarises the `strengths and liabilities of the top two consultancies'. The first was Kinhill Engineers, a firm with other commitments with the Federal Airports Corporation and the second was Mitchell, McCotter, Smyth, Beca.
       </para>
       <para>
        A panel of five people, including three Federal Airports Corporation representatives and the author of the letter of T. W. Crow Associates, Mr Denis Faber, together with the Mayor of Botany, reviewed the potential consultants for the EIS with all of those people supporting Kinhills, with the exception of the Mayor of Botany whose council subsequently objected that it believed Kinhills had designed its EIS submission for the consultancy on the basis of obtaining a `predetermined result'. At page 2 of the letter under heading `Mitchell, McCotter, Smyth, Beca', it reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal by this team-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the aforementioned consultants-
       </para>
       <para>
        indicated a strong political awareness with a good public profile. The team leadership consists of mature individuals, experienced in their own right but unproven as a team. The firm was perceived by some committee members as being more independent from FAC and perhaps less inclined to produce a study to achieve a predetermined result.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, this reflects a deep-seated and organised intention to `produce a study to achieve a predetermined result', as it says. The fact that the other tenderer, Mitchell, McCotter, Smyth, Beca, is judged to be more independent and less inclined to produce a study to achieve a predetermined result and that these are matters clearly considered so important as to be a decisive factor in the awarding of the tender for the EIS to its opposition, renders that EIS irreparably damaged and irreparably compromised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, at bureaucrat level the fix is on. It is here in black and white in this letter, condemned by admission, albeit stunningly naive. At the very least it discloses a willingness to subvert the environmental impact statement, itself a requirement of law, and at worst, it is a matter relating to the awarding of a tender that must be at least investigated.
       </para>
       <para>
        There must be a full and open public inquiry into the awarding of the tender consultancy for the conduct of the EIS on Sydney Airport's proposed third runway. A full, open, public inquiry must be undertaken. Without it there would be, and rightly so, no confidence whatsoever in the EIS or anyone with anything to do with it. I should think that even Kinhills, to clear its own name, would support such an inquiry. It is in the Government's best interests to demand a full inquiry to be seen to be maintaining its word on the intended propriety of the EIS. It is a regrettable situation, but one better exposed in the public interest in the light of day. I seek leave of the House to table this letter in the public interest.

         â€”I thank the House. In the time remaining to me I simply ask why a consultancy must go to someone who will be more inclined to produce a study to achieve a predetermined result. The answer is simple. It is because without that the EIS cannot stand the light of day on its own merits. This letter tonight is a desperate admission of that. It also explains why the EIS has been delayed. I have been told for some time that a number of bureaucrats have had trouble making the facts fit the story. I repeat: it is incumbent on us all to have a full and open public inquiry into the awarding of the tender consultancy for the conduct of that EIS.
