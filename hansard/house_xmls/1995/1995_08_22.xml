        â€”Order! I wish to advise the House that on 28 July the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) raised with me as a matter of privilege actions of the Australian Federal Police in searching his electorate office on 26 July. Under standing order 97A, members are able to bring to the attention of the Speaker matters of privilege arising during the long adjournment periods. The Speaker is able to refer such matters to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges, provided that such referrals are reported by the Speaker at the next sitting. If the House endorses such a referral, the reference to the committee stands and the inquiry proceeds. If, of course, a referral is not supported, the Committee of Privileges can take no further action on such a matter.

        In order to help me to make a decision as to whether to refer the member for Stirling's complaint to the committee, I wrote to him on 31 July seeking additional information. On 11 August I received further information from him. I concluded that it would be proper for Mr Cameron's complaint to go to the Committee of Privileges as allowed by standing order 97A. Accordingly, I referred the matter to the committee in the following terms: whether a contempt was committed in connection with the execution of a search warrant on the electorate office of Mr E. H. Cameron MP on Wednesday, 26  July 1995.

        â€”Whilst the opposition do not oppose the motion before the House, we do believe firmly that it is merely tinkering at the edges. Fundamental reform is necessary in order to improve the workings of this place, but the government continually ignores that fact. The first and foremost problem relates to the rostering system for ministers, which at present sees ministers coming into this House and being held accountable for their actions as the elected representatives of the people of Australia a mere two times a week.

        We now know that, unambiguously, it is a device by the government to shield ministers who are in trouble. And we are going to get a classic example this parliamentary week when the embattled, besieged Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) appears for questioning just once. We will have one opportunity only to ask her how she can justify spending huge amounts of taxpayers' fundsâ€”at least $10,000 a dayâ€”in a phoney defence of some concocted legal principle.

        It is utterly unacceptable to the opposition and to the people at large that ministers be hidden from questioning in this way. It always amuses us when occasionally we see background briefings in newspapers from members of the government's backbench expressing the wish that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) be in here every day and that some of them have approached him saying, `You are our best parliamentary and electoral weapon and you should be in here every day to do over the opposition.'

        If the Prime Minister thought there was an electoral advantage in it, he would be in here. He will do anything for an electoral advantage. The reason he is not in here every day for questioning by the opposition is that he knows he has more to lose. In other words, he is afraid of daily questioning by the opposition. There is no other explanation for the Prime Minister's absence. He is, in fact, a coward in that regard.

        The cowardliness of the Prime Minister and his ministers has caused the institution of the parliament to suffer. This place has far less relevance than it had before the Prime Minister corrupted its procedures in the way he has through the roster systemâ€”and that is a very bad thing. It is one thing for the Prime Minister to make the major government announcements outside of the parliament and to ignore it in all of the principal policy statements and questioning. But it is another thing to choose places like the National Press Club, as he will this Thursday, to face up to questioning by unelected representatives of the media but not by the opposition. He has downgraded the importance of the elected legislature in this country.

        The opposition will restore the pre-eminence of the parliament in the democracy of Australia.

        Above all, we will ensure an independent Speaker. We will wish to preserve the independence of the Speaker by adopting the Westminster system whereby the Speaker, once chosen, is not challenged for either preselection or by candidates from other partiesâ€”they quit the party. So we are anxious that this parliament be seen to operate fairly and the rules apply impartially to all of the participants, unlike the hectoring and bullying you get from the government members, not least of all from the person who occupies that chairâ€”the Prime Minister himself. We worry on your part. We worry for your sake. We know it is next to impossible for you to remain impartial and to apply the standing orders fairly and remain within the Australian Labor Party.

        â€”in replyâ€”I only rise on one point, because we have heard the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) about 500 times before. There is something new in it. This is the first time I have heard such an explanationâ€”and it is a very original explanationâ€”for the sacking of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) by his Liberal Party division. The sacking of the member for Curtin is to create the possibility for him, should the coalition secure office, to be an independent Speaker. This is the first time I have heard that interpretation.

        It outweighs the interpretation that we have all heard in the media to this point in time that the gormlessness of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), his unwillingness to come to the aid of his strongest supporters in Western Australia, his willingness to see them sacked from their endorsementsâ€”and that also applies to one or two of his mates in New South Walesâ€”is to create the possibility of there being a series of Independents in the place so that, should the coalition get elected to office, they would have somebody to choose from so they could say they had an independent Speaker.

        On 19 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v. The Queen. By a majority of six to one the court decided that, where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in such conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established.

         The bill that is now before the House responds to that judgment. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures.

         I turn now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that, because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable members may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court?

         The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be `an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge.

         The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that `in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.' The enactment of the bill now before the House will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, the trigger for the exclusion of evidence will not arise.

         It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation, or exportation, of the prohibited narcotics.

         Controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. They were not operations involving out of control cowboys riding roughshod over our laws. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations.

         The ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State, having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, Senator the Honourable Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service, Senator the Honourable John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once that agreement was obtained the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines. These guidelines run to 50 paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants.

         These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored.

         We are dealing with legislation that arose from the High Court case of Ridgeway v. R in 1995. The court held that where the Federal Police break the law by committing an element of the offence for which the defendant was being prosecuted then the court should exercise its discretion to refuse to allow evidence against the defendant to be admitted against him in that instance. Ridgeway was entitled, as a result of the court's decision in that matter, to a permanent stay of proceedings.

         The majority of the court were deeply concerned with the illegal conduct of those who uphold the law and the effect that has on the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system. They held that if law enforcement officers were to be exempted from this law then it would be an issue for the parliament and not the courts. I will quote from the decision of Sir Anthony Mason; our Governor-General designate, Sir William Deane; and Mr Justice Dawson in this case. It was stated:

        The effective investigation by the police of some types of criminal activity may necessarily involve subterfuge, deceit and the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. When those tactics do not involve illegal conduct, their use will ordinarily be legitimate notwithstanding that they are conducive to the commission of a criminal offence by a person believed to be engaged in criminal activity . . . A finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in such clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it. As with the case of illegal conduct, the discretion will only arise if the conduct has procured the commission of the offence with which the accused is charged.

        The court was not being prudish about these matters. The court recognised that there needs to be some creativeness in the way in which the investigatory authorities undertake criminal investigations and also, as it said, some subterfuge, deceit and intentional creation of opportunities for the commission of a criminal offence by a suspect. But it was when the police or Commonwealth authorities might be party to the commission of an offence that they put it in a different context and came to the decision with which we are dealing now.

         Mr Justice McHugh dissented on the basis that the defendant in this instance had not been induced to commit the offence.

         This bill is seen as a response to the court's decision where the court invited the parliament to deal with this matter further, if it considered the matter warranted it. The bill seeks to ensure that, as a result of the Ridgeway case, the evidence of a controlled operation will not be rendered inadmissible in a court. We understand that, after the handing down of the particular decision, the South Australian parliament has passed similar legislation to that which is proposed here and that there is similar legislation in place in Victoria and New Zealand.

         The objects of this bill, we are told, are, first, to exempt law enforcement officers from criminal liability for conduct in the course of a controlled operation involving importation, export or possession of narcotics which has been authorised by the act; and, second, to require the Commissioner of the Federal Police and the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority to report to the Minister for Justice on all requests to authorise controlled operations and for the minister to report these matters to parliament, as outlined in the bill. The third object that is addressed is to provide that evidence of importation of narcotics, obtained from an operation before the commencement of the amendments in which the Federal Police and Customs officers cooperated to allow narcotics to pass through a Customs barrier, is not to be rejected on the basis of the unlawful conduct of officers.

         The bill does this through amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 by adding additional definitions, such as a definition of what is a `controlled operation', `narcotic goods', `narcotic goods offence', and by the insertion of a proposed part 1AB entitled `Controlled operations for obtaining evidence about certain offences relating to narcotic goods'. Proposed section 15G details the objects of the new part. Proposed section 15H defines a `controlled operation' as an operation that must have three elements: first, certain persons; secondly, acting for certain purposes; and, thirdly, being likely to engage in conduct that constitutes an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act or an associated offence, except for this bill. The second matter it deals with is an operation involving the participation of defined law enforcement officers who are engaging in conduct which would, apart from this part, constitute a narcotic goods offence. The third point is that the operation must be for the purposes of gathering evidence of the importation, export of narcotic goods or associated offences.

         Proposed section 151 is the key provision of the bill. It provides that a law enforcement officer will not be criminally liable for conduct that is, first, carried out in the course of duty; secondly, for the purposes of a controlled operation; and, thirdly, at a time at which a certificate is issued under the act authorising the operation. The officer is not prevented from being civilly liable or criminally liable for other conduct such as theft, bribery or assault even if committed during such an operation.

         There are a number of matters that are of concern to the opposition in relation to this bill. The first issue I want to raise is that of retrospectivity. Future prosecutions will be covered by this bill by retrospectively authorising conduct which has been undertaken in the past. It does not create new offences in relation to individuals, but certain prosecutions that would otherwise fail are being retrospectively ensured of likely success by the passage of this legislation.

         The coalition, on the basis of natural justice, does have a general reluctance to support retrospective legislation especially in relation to criminal law. I want to quote one of my colleagues who will speak later in this debate about our position on this matter.

Under our legal system, laws mean what parliament intended them to mean. The task of deciding what parliament intended a particular law to mean, when there is any doubt about it, is entrusted to the courts.

         The second matter I want to deal with is accountability mechanisms and judicial oversights. One of the major concerns that we have with this particular legislation has been raised by a number of organisations, including the Lawyers Reform Association and the new Ridgeway Coalitionâ€”a group of interested specialist legal practitioners representing the criminal law committees of the New South Wales Law Society, New South Wales Young Lawyers, the Law Council of Australia and representatives of the Criminal Bar Association, the New South Wales Public Defenders, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers, the Lawyers Reform Association and the Australian Chapter of the International Commission of Jurists.

         The bill proposes that senior police officers may authorise the commission of a serious offence without the safeguards of judicial oversight. There is no independent mechanism by which these decisions will be oversighted under the legislation that is proposed by the government. I will, in due course, put before the parliament some of the reasoning of the minister in pressing this particular matter. The Ridgeway Coalition has suggested to the minister that certificates be issued by the Federal Court on sworn application only. This is in line with the circumstances in which other unusual conduct by police is authorised, and that is the issue of warrants for telephone interceptions which can cover a range of offences, some being quite significant, some being relatively minor.

         I notice that in relation to telecommunications interception laws there was an attempt to balance competing interests, namely privacy and freedom of speech on the one hand and law enforcement requirements on the other. The sorts of offences involved were murder, kidnapping, certain narcotics offences and offences which are subject to special investigation by the National Crime Authority. The second range of offences are punishable by seven years imprisonment or more and involve the loss of life or serious personal injury, trafficking in narcotic goods, serious fraud and other offences. It can be seen in relation to telecommunications offences that some of them are significantly less serious crimes than we are speaking of in relation to these controlled operations. That is the point that needs to be understood.

         When the Minister for Justice was asked to address this matter he tried to suggest that authorisations here were quite different from the sorts of authorisations that are required in relation to telecommunications interceptions. I want to quote from his letter to Mr Mauri Stack, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The circumstances in which a judge or magistrate is required to act as a decision maker are those in which law enforcement objectives must be balanced against the need to protect against unreasonable invasion of civil liberties, for example, in seeking to search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrants. A controlled operation does not involve any such invasion. The decision-making criteria are operational, relating to the likely effectiveness and security of the operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        What interested me was that the minister, in his own letter and in his speech today, recognised that we are again balancing difficult issues. In the concluding paragraph of his own letter to Mr Stack, Minister Kerr said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is always a difficult task to balance the need to allow the effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law, against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, and to prevent corruption and abuse of powers by police.

         With regard to the authorisation issue, I think the minister has set up a straw man to say that this matter ought to be left in the hands of the police because they are operational issues that are being addressed. Clearly in relation to this legislation we are looking at the balancing of very important issues: the need for effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, to prevent corruption and abuse of powers, and to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. Who better to do that but the courts, as was seen as appropriate in other legislation? It seems to me that these are proper issues to be investigated in that way.

         The authorisation of the breach of laws does provide enormous potential for abuse. There is a strong argument to increase the accountability provisions to prevent this. This may be done by extending the information concerning the controlled operation to be provided to parliament. The bill currently provides that the minister is required to report annually on the details of an application made for certificates but that there is no requirement to report the outcomes of controlled operations. We ask additionally: are the requirements to supply information to enable a decision whether or not to grant a certificate adequate?

         As I said, under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, consideration is given to whether alternative methods of investigation are capable of providing suitable evidence for the charges to be laid. With the offences of conspiracy, an attempt may be prosecuted instead. Further, maybe the seeker of certificates should be required to demonstrate the gravity of the offence, and this should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to issue a certificate. These are matters, properly, that a committee might want to review.

There needs to be a balance reached between limiting the powers of the Federal Policeâ€”and hence jeopardising the prospects of bringing drug traffickers to justiceâ€”and community concern about the growing problem of drugs, and whether the police should be involved in organising the commission of a crime, the argument that controlled operations may be encouraging crime due to the facilitation by law enforcement bodies of a controlled delivery, the argument that there are other crimes the person may be convicted of and the civil libertarian concerns.

These include theftâ€”the great number of thefts which involve people attacking others or stealing their goods so that they can use drugs. There are the gaol costs. It costs anywhere between $30,000 to $100,000 a year to keep someone in gaol. A high proportion of people in gaol now are there due to drug related offences.

         Only 40 years ago it was legal for a medical practitioner to prescribe heroin and a pharmacist to dispense it. The medical practitioner prescribed oral heroin; the pharmacist dispensed sometimes linctus heroin. When the item was dispensed the patient was told very often by their doctor, `Don't come back for another week. I'm not going to give you any more.' The patient did just that. A high proportion of the people who were addicted to heroin and other drugs such as chloral hydrate, cocaine and even betel nut were under some degree of control by their doctor. The doctor acknowledged their addiction. The pharmacist knew of their addiction. The legal authorities tended to overlook the addiction. It was illegal to be an addict, but people tended to go along with it if the addicted person was under some control. The person would not break into a pharmacy.

One thing that is very evidentâ€”one might call it the clinical evidenceâ€”is this: the problems that exist now did not confront us 40, 50 or 60 years ago or even hundreds of years before that because one could obtain these drugs under varying degrees of control.

         I can understand why we want police power to combat drugs. I agree with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that it is crucial that the community is aware that controlled narcotics operations have been used successfully by Australian and overseas law enforcement bodies, and that the Ridgeway decision means that we have to give legislative backing to the method, introducing a range of strict safeguards to ensure the process is not absurd. Either we recognise that or we have our hands over our faces. We chuckle at little children for trying to hide from someone by holding their hands over their faces.

But we do not have to acknowledge that we continue to have to live with the present situation of drug laws as they operate in Australia today. Let us learn from history.

         â€”The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 is to amend the Crimes Act 1914. I note that it was introduced into this House on 29 Juneâ€”the last scheduled day of the last sittings. It turned out not to be the last day of sittings, due to the mismanagement by the government of business in the Senate.

         This second reading debate has obviously been given some urgency by the governmentâ€”it being the first item of government business on the first day of this final sittings for the year. The bill proposes to authorise the commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and members of the National Crime Authority to issue certificates authorising a controlled law enforcement operation involving the import, export and possession of narcotic drugs. The bill provides that, subject to certain conditions being met, certain law enforcement officers are not criminally liable for offences against the provisions of the Customs Act which prohibit the importation of narcotics.

I will say more about the provisions of the bill in a moment.

         As has been mentioned, Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Article 11 of that convention deals with what is termed `controlled delivery'. Controlled delivery is defined in the convention as the technique of allowing certain narcotic drugs `to pass out of, through or into the  territory of one or more countries, with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities, with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of offences' under the convention.

         Article 11 imposes an obligation on Australia as a party to `take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences and to taking legal action against them'. Australia thus has a positive duty to ensure that the appropriate laws are in place for a system of controlled narcotics operations to be conducted by law enforcement officials with the aim of stemming the international flow of narcotics and psychotropic substances.

         But this bill is not prompted by the government's duty to implement an international obligation. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech, this bill is the government's response to the decision of the High Court in the case of Ridgeway v. R delivered this year. The High Court decided in that case that, where law enforcement officials break the law by committing as principal or as an accessory the offence for any which the defendant is being prosecuted, then, as a general rule, a court should exercise a discretion to refuse to allow the evidence gathered in the course of that illegal conduct to be admitted.

         The majority judges of the High Court were concerned that, when those who are entrusted to uphold the law engage in illegal conduct, confidence in the criminal justice system will be lost. These judges said that, if law enforcement officers are to be exempted from the law, then that was an issue for parliament and not for the courts. This bill would reverse the effect of the decision in Ridgeway by exempting law enforcement officers from criminal liability for certain conduct related to importation, exportation or possession of narcotics. The bill aims to ensure the evidence gathered by the police as a result of their conduct will be able to be presented to a court for consideration as evidence against the accused.

         To understand how the bill will operate, it is necessary to look at the grounds on which a certificate authorising a controlled operation may be given. There are four grounds. First, the applicant must satisfy the authorising officer that he or she has provided as much information as he or she possesses about the nature and the quantity of narcotics to which the operation relates. The aim of this is that, as far as possible, the certificate must accurately describe the narcotics in question.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the suspected criminal activity under investigation would have taken place without the involvement of law enforcement officials. In the explanatory memorandum, the government states that this is to ensure that certificates are not issued to allow the police to entrap citizens who otherwise would not have been involved in the commission of a narcotics offence.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the operation has a genuine law enforcement purposeâ€”that it will make it much easier to obtain evidence that may lead to the prosecution of an offence of importing narcotics in breach of the Customs Act. Fourthly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that any narcotics involved in the operation and that will arrive in Australia at the end of the operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer. As the government states in the explanatory memorandum, it is essential, no matter the route taken or the different couriers involved, that the narcotics be under police control at the end of the operation. It is vital that drugs do not go astray and enter the community.

         For my part, I regard the so-called retrospective section of the bill as not retrospective in any real sense. It is a part of the bill which applies only to controlled operations started before the commencement of the bill. Its effect will be that evidence that narcotics were imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act is not inadmissible on the grounds that a law enforcement officer committed an offence in importing narcotics, if three things can be shown.

         The first is that the police officer must have been acting in the course of duty for the purposes of the controlled operation when he or she committed the offence. Secondly, it must have been a purpose of the operation to obtain evidence leading to the prosecution of a person for a narcotics offence. Thirdly, for the purposes of the controlled operation, an Australian Federal Police member must have made a written request, which purported to be made in accordance with the 1987 ministerial agreement relating to such requests, to a customs official that narcotics be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny, and that request must have been granted.

         The retrospective effect of this part of the bill is to make admissible evidence that would, under the decision in Ridgeway, almost certainly be excluded from evidence against an accused in a narcotics case because of the illegality of the police conduct.

         This therefore appears not to be a case where the parliament is by legislation retrospectively making illegal an act that at the time it was committed was lawful. In fact, in relation to the police conduct, it is making legal an act which was illegal at the time it was committed. It appears not to have been, therefore, of the character of truly retrospective legislation that is anathema to the principles of justice to which the coalition, and I, adhere. However, it is an unusual piece of legislation, and the ramifications of it do require detailed examination. It is appropriate, in my view, that this examination be conducted by a parliamentary committee.

It appears that so far only the judges of the Federal Court of Australia and the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia have been nominated.

In recent times it has considered and reported on the child sex tourism legislation, the International War Crimes Tribunal legislation and the search warrants legislation, all of which deal with the relationship between police powers and the citizen.

         If police are to engage in conduct that would ordinarily be criminal, such as importing heroin, in order to defeat crime, the conduct must be done in a lawful way. In other words, we need legislation which lays down the sorts of circumstances in which it can be done and we need a judicial, administrative and parliamentary process to ensure that it is always lawful, always necessary and always scrutinised. It is not merely a question of closing a loophole before too many drug dealers get through.

        It was a very sad day for most members of this House, certainly for those who knew Fred Daly, when we learned that he had died. He was a larger than life figure who gave great colour and sustenance to the Labor Party during most of the postwar years up to his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1975.

         He was very much a classic son of the Labor Party. He was the son of Irish parents, who came from County Clare in Ireland. He was one of 11 children. When he was 11 his father died, which must have been a dreadful personal blow to him. You could imagine what the loss of the breadwinner of a family of 11 would have been at that time, in the 1920s.

          Fred left school at 14 and earned some money for the family. He took his first job with a bicycle firm as a messenger. He soon became an active member of the Federated Clerks Unionâ€”an association which he was to maintain all his life. He was a young man during the Depression, and those years of hardship no doubt stayed with him right through his life and formed his social and political views.

         Fred joined the Labor Party, seeing the Labor Party as a vehicle of social change and also the party that protected working Australians and looked after their interests. He sought to become a member of the House of Representatives, which he did for the division of Martin in 1943. He was then a member of the Curtin government. They were, at that time, in the depths of the Second World War and prosecuting the war. I know he was very upset by Curtin's death in 1945. He then remained a dedicated member of the Chifley government up until 1949 and unerringly spoke favourably about Ben Chifley.

         He was, for the federal Labor Party, one of the links back to the Curtin and Chifley years. I think Fred was the last member of the Curtin government. Through him we have, in a sense, a connection back to that time. Though some other members of the Chifley administration are alive today, he was one of the celebrated people of that period. He spent all those years in opposition up until 1972. Like a generation of Labor people, he lost, in a sense, that opportunity, that youthful experience, he had had. He had already been in public life for a very long time by the time the Labor Party was next elected to government in 1972. He had been in parliament virtually 30 years at that stage.

         Along with a number like him, government came a bit late in Fred's life. Though the joy that overtook him with that victory sustained him for the rest of his life, he lived through the Labor Party in the dark days of the split. Even when I came here in 1969, as a remnant of that argument some members of the caucus did not talk to others. He suffered quite substantially at that time.

         As the Whitlam opposition had nearly taken the election in 1969, there was a tremendous amount of goodwill between members of the party, those in factions who had looked askance at one another for a long period of time. They got themselves into a position to win in 1972. That group of people who had experienced that long period of opposition, from 1949 to 1972, were of course the core ministerial group of the Whitlam government. It was, I think, one of the things which certainly made Fred's later life. He was overjoyed by the opportunity.

         Fred was Minister for Services and Property and was also Leader of the House. He was always very happy when the opposition called a division. He never liked to take a vote on the ayes. He said, `I was on the receiving end for so long, I liked to put the boot in and watch the numbers go up.' He would sit back there and chuckle away as the vote was counted. He was a great public speaker. He had huge mental agility, tremendous word flow and tremendous construction of ideas in a speech. He was humorous and mocking. He had all of the skills that the old parliamentary debate used to breed in people who had that experience. He employed those skills very effectively. He was always effective in reply: listen to an argument, see what comes your way and then put the counter case. I know it is often the job of the Leader of the House in any parliament to take the argument on behalf of the government when matters arise in the parliament, particularly at the behest of the opposition. That is true today; it was true then. He used to take the argument then and most effectively.

         The parish priest at St Brigid's in Marrickville, in his remarks about Fred at the funeral, made some telling points about Fred's connection with his electorate and his community which were all completely true. It showed that he never lost that touch with the public or his compassion for them. He felt the need to represent their interests poignantly and he did that. He was perhaps a typical Labor figure, growing up in a working class suburb, representing it all of his adult life, staying loyal to it thereafter and, which was then an unusual thing, keeping a connection with the parliament and the parliamentary party later on though he was no longer in it.

He served as a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security from 1943 to 1946, a member of the Rationing Committee from 1946 to 1950, a member and later deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1967 to 1972 and a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council from 1970 to 1973.

He was quite bitter about that, but he never let that bitterness intrude upon his relations with people.

He had many friendsâ€”and I am very happy to say that they were from both sides of the Houseâ€”and he kept those friends right through his life.

It is only for me to record that on one occasion, when Ralph Hunt had lost access to his accommodation arrangements in Canberra, it was none other than Frederick Michael Daly AO who came to Ralph Hunt's rescue and offered him accommodation for that period to help him out, in a way which I guess we would not see this day.

         It is sad, as the Leader of the Opposition remarkedâ€”maybe it is the media, maybe it is the changing nature of federal politics in Australia in the 1990sâ€”that it seems there will be fewer characters of the Fred Daly and Jim Killen type in the system. That it is so is a great pity, and it is all the more reason why I express deep sympathy on the loss of Fred Daly.

         I have two layers of memories of Fred Daly: youthful ones, because he shared, in what was very much an odd couple relationship, an office with my father for over a decade so that the times I came to Canberra Fred loomed very large in my life; and more recent ones, since we have been in government, of Fred, as a solid supporter of the government, a solid supporter of the party, being a frequent presence here in the parliament and at major public occasions, full of good advice, wit and joy of life.

         The last time I saw Fred Daly was when I was opening an exhibition on the life of John Curtin to memorialise his death. This was only a few days before Fred died. Fred came along and sat conspicuously to one side to listen to the proceedings. It was extraordinary to watch how he was treated by the very large gathering as an historical object in himself. This was something that he very much enjoyed because he pointed out to everybody who came past himâ€”correctlyâ€”that he was the last person alive who sat in a parliament with John Curtin. That is the case. His passing means that that critical link to our past has now disappeared and there is no-one alive who served in parliament with John Curtin. He had that wonderful historical presence that went along with all the rest that he represented.

         Dad told me that one of the things he dreaded was to go on an electoral visit to Sydney with Fred because Fred was quintessentially a man of Sydney politics, quick-witted and knowing. That is Sydney politicsâ€”quick-witted and knowingâ€”and part of that knowing is knowing everybody. A progress along a street with Fred anywhere in Sydney was a diabolically slow process. You might have thought that you would get a couple of blocks doorknocking, but you never would. You might have thought you could go a fair way down the track. You never would because Fred would stop with everybody, whatever part of Sydney you happened to be in, and engage them in quick-witted conversation and then say, `Here's Kim Beazley. What have you got to say, Kim?' `Oh, thank you, Fred.' The breadth and depth of his contacts was extraordinary,

         As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) referred to, he was of a generation of Labor politiciansâ€”which still existsâ€”that combines a love of rugby league, a love of their faith and their church, and a love of the Labor Party. At the memorial mass for Fred there was a wonderful comment made about one of those branch members loyally supportive of Fred Daly over the years, so confused in her relationships as a daily communicant and a regular attendee of these political gatherings that she would genuflect to the chair as she came in. There is a view that that is not an unwise thing to do anyway in the politics of the branches that we operate. So there may be more to it than the priest actually understood. Nevertheless, it was a statement too about Fred.

At the front of the bus was seated a very obvious member of the British aristocracy who was there for the occasion. Fred, at the back of the line, was obviously a little depressed at the obvious deference that was being paid this gentleman as everybody got aboard the bus. So he got aboard himself, he was just about the last one, and he spread his arms and said, `Here I am; Lord help us!'

My memory of him is getting on a similar mode of transportâ€”an aircraftâ€”and coming out of Canberra with the front end of the plane loaded with current members of parliament, as is its wont on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, heading down to Melbourne. When Fred got on there was always an instant presence. You could hear his voice before he came into view. So there would be absolute silence as Fred moved down the corridor. He looked at us all and said, `I'm going down the back where people pay for their own airfares.'

         Everybody has spoken about his absence of bitterness, which was extraordinary. When you look back on his life, particularly before he got a safe seat in parliament, you see that he was involved in some diabolically bloody preselection battles. He had to have a preparedness, of course, once getting a safe seat, to fight even more bloody preselection battles, or at least the threat of them, whenever an election was likely to come on.

         He also went through the terrible bitterness of the splits in the Labor Party of the 1950s and the great disappointment of his ejection from office along with the rest of the Whitlam government in 1975. But he could say this: `When I was elected to parliament I was told I was a oncer. I ask those honourable members opposite who hold slim seats to remember that. Then I won a second time and I was a twicer. Then the electors made me a lifer, which made me happier still. The point about the thrust of politics is that it is a dangerous thing to make permanent enemies on either side or even in one's own party, because the fellow who is against you today may be with you tomorrow.' So his personality was entirely sunny, entirely joyful and unencumbered by the barnacles that grow on all of us in politics as the years go by for which we are never careened. He was always unencumbered by that and led that joyous life.

         But it would be wrong to sayâ€”and I conclude with thisâ€”that there was not an extremely serious side to him. He was deeply committed to democratic politics and deeply committed to the conditions of democracy in this countryâ€”how people got themselves elected to parliament, the basis on which they were elected and how they would be funded to get into those processesâ€”because in that lay the essence of a fair system, in Fred's mind. He was able to do a deal about it when he became Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House.

         He also took very seriously what is these days now termed the social safety net. In his first speech to parliament in the middle of the war he commented on the fact that the extraordinary centralised commitment that resulted from the necessities of federal government during the war was not to be lost when the peace came. If the nation could get its resources together to successfully fight that conflict, it could get itself together to fight a conflict which had made at least as much impact on him, and that was the conflict of trying to find a means of subsistence during the Depression. The thought of that lived with him all his political life and dominated the views that he expressed in parliament.

Fred was a wonderful character and, as the Deputy Prime Minister has suggested, it would not be possible for any of us in this place to recap in a few words either the memory or the quality of the man or his contribution to Australian politics.

         I was interested in turning back to Fred's maiden speech. He always had an ability to hit things where they really should be.

It was in the dark years of World War II that he concluded his speech by saying:

He referred to the fact that it was about the only time the

         In trying to express in a few moments something of the man I would be wrong if I did not tell every private member of this place that they may well not realise the debt they owe Fred. As has been explained, he spent 23 long years in opposition. He felt there was a great divide between the perks and lurks of office and the measures available to those who were ordinary members of the parliament. In the early stages of his administration of the then services and property portfolio, Fred made sure that there was some correction of that imbalance. He introduced a number of measures which private members of this place still enjoy today. Alan Reid suggested in an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bulletin
         </emphasis>
         of 25 August 1973 that Fred was about narrowing the affluence gap between backbenchers and ministers. I think that is a motivation which many who are today's backbenchers might well feel very worth while.

         In looking back at that same debate on the occasion of the valedictory of Fred, I remember a couple of remarks that were made. I know that we all regarded Fred as a great master of electoral boundaries so that they would advantage, naturally, the party to which he belonged. The only trouble was that I am told that in the very early days of his own candidature he was standing for the seat of Marrickville. He made one of his very early speeches in Spring Street, Bondi, which is no doubt known to the ex-member for Phillip, who is here today. At that stage Spring Street, Bondi happened to be in the electorate of Phillip, not in the seat of Marrickville. He extolled his virtues through a slogan, which I still think is magnificentâ€”`Give us this day, our Daly Fred'. That was his slogan for his first campaign.

It is sad that the humour which he used so effectively is so rarely present in the ordinary conduct of affairs of this House.

         Fred Daly was a great Australian. He certainly was a great member of the Labor Party.

From very humble origins, he rose to be a very senior and well-respected minister of this place.

When Fred got his position as a minister, he changed the sitting rules of the House of Representatives. People forget that it was Fred who brought in the 10.30 adjournment and the 11 o'clock stop. For most of you in the House, that is a nothing, but to those few of us who are still left from those days it was magical to know that when you came back into parliament you did not have to sit here until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock. Fred always reckoned he damaged the midnight dinners of sausages, mashed potatoes and peas which we had when we knew we were going to be here until three or four in the morning, before he brought his rules in. So all of us have a current appreciation of what Fred was about.

         Another thing that has not been mentioned by either side is that when Fred spoke on this side of the Houseâ€”in the other building, of courseâ€”members of the government used to come and hear him. In those daysâ€”Kim's father's dayâ€”people came to hear those who they thought were entertaining and good value. People came down to hear Gough Whitlam, Clyde Cameron and Fred Daly when they sat on this sideâ€”and there were others on our side. The whole House would come down to listen to them. Can you imagine anybody today coming down to hear the good speakers on the other side of the House? It is just not on, because the mood has changed.

         Fred had an appeal to people in this parliament. One of the advantages of having Fred in Sydney was that you were a Sydney member. You would say to Fred, `Fred, how should we describe you?' He would say, `As a Gilroy Catholic.' The Gilroy Catholics did not join the DLP. He and Arthur Calwell shared a very real axis with each other on this very point. Again, it is forgotten by most people in the Labor Party, but, my goodness, it was not forgotten by the people in the Labor Party around Australia in the 1950sâ€”which was even before my time.

         â€”Like many other people in the chamber today, I first came across Fred when I tuned in and listened to the parliamentary broadcasts. The first time I saw him was at the joint sitting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) mentioned. I think I was in my last year at school. All good people at De La Salle College at Cronulla, who leant towards the Labor side of politics, would go up and tune into those parliamentary sittings. There was Fred Daly introducing and passing the legislation that delivered one vote, one value to Australia. One of the great achievements of the Whitlam government was achieved at that joint sitting, and it was the legislation pioneered by Fred Daly.

         As a result of that legislation, I got to vote at the 1975 election in the electorate of Cook, which is the electorate of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Despite the fact that I had turned 18 and had the right to vote, it did not make much difference in the electorate of Cook in 1975, but I did get the chance to meet Fred Daly at an election rally at which Fred was the guest speaker in the 1975 election campaign. Despite the fact that he had announced his intention to retire, he was still out there advocating and fighting for the Labor cause. And it was not just in 1975 that he did those things. As recently as early this year, Fred Daly was up in the state electorate of Peats opening Labor Party campaign offices. He was still keeping the faith, as one of the people said at the funeral mass at St Brigid's.

         I bumped into Jim Killen at the airport on the morning of Fred's funeral. He was obviously very distressed and sad about the fact that Fred had passed away. Someone in my electorate mentioned the other day that it was a very touching moment to see Jim Killen interviewed on television. The fact that there was that close friendship between Jim Killen and Fred Daly says a lot about the nature of Australian politicsâ€”perhaps particularly in those days. All of us in this chamber know that there are still friendships across the aisle today, and that is a good thing.

         â€”I have seen the reports from the weekend of increased bank charges by the Commonwealth Bank. I must say that I found them quite extraordinary in the context of the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as an outcome of the report which we commissioned earlier this year. That followed concern expressed in the community around January about increased bank charges.

         The report by the PSA was available in July. It expressed the view that there was a need for restructuring the charges and that banks had essentially imposed these charges without too much regard to equity and fairness. In particular, the report was very critical of account keeping fees which were payable by people with amounts of less than $500 in their accounts. There was a view that this should be restructured in this regard in particular, but also in other respects.

         Included amongst this was the belief by the authority that there should be a removal of the inward dishonoured cheque charge. That relates to when someone hands you a cheque, you bank it and it bounces. At the moment, banks charge a fee of around $9 for that and the Commonwealth Bank has now increased that charge from $9 to $10. The view of the authority was that there was no real justification for that charge because the person was not only not getting the money from the dishonoured cheque but also getting a fee imposed by the bank.

         This area of bank charges is obviously one of considerable difficulty, but the report by the PSA is one which I believed the banks were going to respond to in an appropriate way. There were certainly expressions of intention by the banks following the report that they would pay close regard to the recommendations and seek to carry out its recommendations.

         The decision by the Commonwealth Bank is not in the spirit of that outcome. The decision by the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the dishonoured cheque charge and in respect of another itemâ€”that relates to duplicates or the reissuing of statements, for which the costs were also increasedâ€”was also the subject of a recommendation by the PSA along the lines that such charges needed to be looked at very closely in terms of their fairness.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Generally, what the Commonwealth Bank has done is increase its fees across a range of items, including the two that I have mentioned but also on others which were not the subject of the PSA report. In general, they have raised those charges to about the highest level of any of the other competing banks, although in a couple of cases they have become the highest. In that respect, they have taken action which can be seen to be perhaps not in accordance with the spirit of the report.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is our intention that the banks should adhere to the spirit of that report. One of the PSA recommendations was that there should be monitoring of the banks' fees and charges for the next three years. We have accepted that report and we will be formally commissioning the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to carry out that monitoring over a three-year period. That does not mean nothing happens for three years. They will monitor developments as they occur. As appropriate, the competition commission will make recommendations to us about any developments that they believe the government needs to be informed about or take action on.

         I have also spoken with the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank and have expressed my concern about these actions. I believe it is unfortunate indeed that the Commonwealth Bank, still being majority owned by the Australian government, has taken action which is, as I see it, not in accordance with the spirit of the report and which in fact flouts a couple of the recommendations. I think that is most unfortunate indeed. We would expect the Commonwealth Bank, above all banks, to adhere to the recommendations of the PSA report. We will certainly be doing our utmost to ensure that that is the outcome in terms of the actions by the Commonwealth Bank in the future.

         â€”I thank the member for Page for his question and for his continuing interest in this industry, which is so vitally important to micro-economic reform. When the opposition was last in government we had no competition whatsoever in telecommunications, just as we had the sclerosis of the two-airline policy and no competition at all in railways. In communications, aviation and railways, it has been this government that has opened up these areas for important micro-economic reform.

         Since the government has allowed the entry of Optus, the establishment of the duopoly in telecommunications, we have had prices go down by what Access Economics has estimated to be $400 million. We have had investment by the carriers almost double to $4 billion. We have had exports go up by a factor of almost fourâ€”that is, 400 per centâ€”and we have had a much wider choice of services and products for consumers.

         It is the government's view that, if the introduction of one competitor will deliver these benefits to business and residential consumers, by moving to full and open competition we can ensure that even greater benefits are delivered to everyone who uses telecommunications services. We will end up with the most competitive and the most open telecommunications market in the world.

         The way we will deliver that is, first of all, from 1 July 1997, under a Labor government, the door will be open for new carriers to come to Australia and set up shop. We want to encourage as many new carriers as possible to get out there and snap away at the heels of Optus and Telstra because we want to make sure that we do not end up with a cosy duopoly in the way that the Liberal and National parties left us with a cosy, sclerotic duopoly in aviation.

We will be building on the Trade Practices Act to ensure that we have telecommunications specific regulations. We will have the same principles of the Trade Practices Act but applied in a speedier manner and a manner that ensures that we have sustainable competition in telecommunications. In fact, we will build upon the Hilmer principles to require carriers to provide undertakings to the ACCC. These undertakings will ensure that other carriers and service providers can have access to the cables and the infrastructure and, if necessary, at an arbitrated price. This will be the first occasion on which service providers will be able to get arbitration on that interconnect price.

         This regime will be the most competitive and the most open in the world because nowhere else in the world do the service providers get arbitration on price. This is a very important principle. In New Zealand and in Britain they do not get that. In the United States they are still arguing about how they go about making their communications market more competitive. In Europe they are saying that in 1998 all member countries of the European Union must be in the position that Australia was in in 1992 when we allowed Optus to enter the market. So by 1998 the Europeans will be where Australia was six years before.

         While the government has made those commitments that will ensure that the price caps are toughened so that the benefits for residential consumers are guaranteed, and while we have ensured that there is a cap on local call prices until at least 1999, the opposition, in reaction to that, has simply said that the government's 1999 principles are too vague. So, while all these conversations are going on opposite, we are dealing with one of the most important micro-economic reforms that this government will implement this term.

         So that reform is taking place, but the opposition says it is too vague. That is its reaction. But Optus has welcomed the policy framework for its many policy outcomes in supporting sustainable competition. Telstra has said that it is a most important basis for the development of a competitive and innovative telecommunications industry. The Consumers Telecommunications Network has welcomed the important safeguards for consumers. The Telecommunications Industry Association says it is a visionary policy that is supported by all of the equipment manufacturers. The Australian Telecommunications Users Group says that the reforms will make the industry more competitive. So all of the stakeholders in this industry support what the government is trying to doâ€”lower prices, make the industry more competitive and lift exports. Members of the opposition are the only ones who are saying that it is too vague and that they are not happy with it.

         We say that our two aims are more competition and open access. The only person in public life in Australia who is against those two principles is Senator Richard Alston, the opposition spokesmanâ€”the man who said that he wants closed access, not open access, on the cable, and the man who said that he wants regional monopolies, not more competition in broadband roll-out. Is it any wonder that the opposition's only reaction to this important micro-economic reform is to say, `It's too vague.' We know who is too vague.

         In answering this question, I think one needs to go back momentarily to what happened prior to this government coming into office. Members may recall that, as part of the total failure of industrial relations policy at the time of the Fraser government, there was a wages explosion in 1981-82 which meant an 18 per cent increase in wages in the 12 months to September 1982. Of course, that meant that there was a level of wages which were totally unsustainable. In real terms, there was a big increase in inflation. By the time we came into government, we had double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That was our inheritance. It was our first duty to try to get the economy back onto a growth path. That meant some control of the wages situation through the Accord, which brought us to a growth path quite quickly and then to dramatic increases in employmentâ€”which was what everybody wanted to see.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In terms of the increase in wages since that time against that background, there was some reduction in real wages at the start but then we got onto a growth path. There has been an increase in real wages of some 7.4 per cent over the period that we have been in office for those on average weekly earnings; that is, for real adult average weekly earnings. That 7.4 per cent itself understates the real increase in the welfare of workers because, in addition to that, half of the work force have achieved superannuation entitlements that they previously did not have.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For those who gained from award superannuation and subsequently from the superannuation guarantee, there has been an additional six per cent payable to them as of now. That amount will move to up to nine per cent by the year 2002. It is six per cent for large employers and five per cent for small employers this year. Eventually, all of them will be at nine per cent by the year 2002. With the other measures in the budget, there are even further benefits coming by way of the government's co-contribution for employees' own contributions.

         To this point, on top of the 7.4 per cent real increase in real adult average weekly earnings, we have, for those who had no superannuation entitlement, a further six per cent increase in superannuation, giving them a 13 1/2 per cent increase in real earnings. Six per cent of that is being put aside for them. For those who had their superannuation first payable when the award superannuation began in 1987, this would mean that they would have accumulated in the order of $10,500 to this stage through these superannuation entitlements, and that amount of money will grow more rapidly in the future.

         It is a complete furphy to say that under this government there has been a reduction in real wages. What we have had under this government has been a sensible wages policyâ€”a policy under the Accord, which has been economically responsible, which has given us good wage outcomes in terms of getting overall growth, and which has resulted in a much faster rate of growth under this government than the previous governmentâ€”about a 3 1/2 per cent average compared with a 2 1/2 half per cent average under the previous government. There has been far greater growth in employmentâ€”about three times the growth of employment in the number of jobs per year during our period of office compared with the Fraser government's period of office. In association with that, as I have just explained, there have been real improvements in wages and, through superannuation, even further increases in real wages for those who previously did not enjoy any superannuation entitlement.

Treasurer, is it the case that the taxpayer funded legal defence of the minister for health if, as you maintain, relates to her employment, would be a fringe benefit and taxable under the fringe benefits tax? Did you seek any advice as to its taxability prior to the decision to grant her unlimited taxpayer defence? Will you be seeking any contribution to that tax from the beneficiary, Dr Lawrence?

         Finally, we are entitled to ask: if Telstra ceases to be 100 per cent Australian owned, and a company like British Telecom or AT&amp;T owns 49 per cent of Telstra, why would they let Telstra be up in Asia winning export dollars for Australia, becoming a communications hub for the region? Why would they let Telstra keep on doing the hard work in Asia, creating jobs and investment for Australia for years to come? They will not. Companies like British Telecom and AT&amp;T would rather have the parent company up there in Asia winning the orders rather than their part-owned Australian subsidiary. For all of these reasons, Mr Speaker, we are totally opposed to the Liberal and National parties' attempts that would result in the biggest transfer of Australian assets to foreigners that we have ever seen.

There will be great benefit for consumers under these reform policies as long as there is a balance between suppliers and consumersâ€”exactly the sort of thing that the minister for communications talked about earlierâ€”in our implementation of competition policy reform.

         Unfortunately, not all governments are carrying out implementation of this policy in the proper manner. I have recently been a few times to Victoria. Some most unfortunate things are occurring there. An example from Victoria of how not to protect consumers comes from the restructuring of the water authorities in that state. I discovered, for instance, in one recent visit that in one town in Victoria people are paying three times as much for their water as people in a nearby town and that the water is in fact undrinkable. In Daylesford, a car ride from Melbourne, you cannot drink the water and you are paying three times as much for it as you are in the nearby town of Ballarat.

         The Victorian government claims that it is hitting consumers in this way because it has to conform to a competition program laid down by the federal government. That is totally false and totally gutless. The only government responsible for what is happening to consumers in Victoria is the Victorian government. By contrast, the policy and principles laid down by the federal government are absolutely clear. Competition works when demand and supply are on equal footing in the marketâ€”exactly the consideration for consumers that the minister for communications talked about.

         To avoid the sorts of things that are happening in Victoria, I have set in place a series of programs to ensure that consumers achieve a status they need and the benefits they can get from competition policy. We are going to make sure that we have what I call consumer protection obligations implemented. Consumers will get the sorts of benefits they have normally expected under the current delivery of services by public monopolies, things like freedom of information mechanisms and information disclosure, means of complaint and redress, guarantees of safety and qualityâ€”these are normal things that consumers have to demandâ€”compliance with consumer protection law and protection of privacy.

At the same time, they are again causing the taxpayers of Western Australia to meet unnecessary legal costs. My estimate is $100,000 a day. If you are concerned about the possible costs of an individual's legal representation, ask about the cost of running that commission. Ask what that might do in Western Australia. Add to that the costs of the Mabo legal challenge. Look at what the government is doing in Western Australia. Look at Court, the Crichton-Browne crony. This whole government has been set up by the people who set up this commission and they are beneath contempt.

         â€”This is a matter that the member for O'Connor might well listen to. It is a very important matter relating to Australian citizens and changes in their attitudes towards violence. The government policies are on the right track. Our community education campaigns are working. Eight years ago, when the government asked Australians what their attitudes to domestic violence were, the picture that emerged was sadly closer to myth than reality. In 1995, as a result of community education, we as a community have a much deeper and broader understanding of violence, particularly domestic violence.

         I was very pleased to release today the report on community attitudes to violence against women. The survey recently conducted by ANOP found that the majority of peopleâ€”some 93 per centâ€”regard domestic violence as a crime. That compares with only 79 per cent of people in 1987 who thought it was a crime.

         In 1987, one in five Australians were prepared to condone domestic violence in some circumstances; they were prepared to make excuses for it. But I am pleased to say that this survey found that the number had halved. Fewer than one in 10 Australians believe that physical force is justified when a man is `provoked' by his wife. I am also pleased that most people recognise that tougher laws and harsher penalties are not the solutionâ€”something that I hope members opposite listen to, because most of their state governments appear to want to reach for these solutionsâ€”and that education and counselling should be given a higher priority.

         We have established a series of campaigns which are clearly working, and we will continue with those. A lot of the funds have gone to local community agencies throughout the country to develop campaigns, training materials and resources. But that is no reason to be complacent. Violence and the fear of violence are still of major concern to Australian women and, of course, to many men. Some 80 per cent of women are worried about violence and increasing violence. So it is very important indeed for us to address this issue.

         As I mentioned earlier, sadly we do continue to be judgmental of victims. Some 77 per cent of respondents do not understand why victims do not leave violent situations. Sadly, a significant minority feel that women make false claims of rape, which suggests a reluctance to believe victims. Those figures outline the areas in which we still have further work to do. The government will continue to lead the way in developing a better understanding of domestic violence.

        Nothing more graphically demonstrates what is fundamentally wrong about this government than the Carmen Lawrence affair. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly to the Australian public the arrogance displayed by this government, particularly the arrogance of this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his senior ministers. The Prime Minister is the very person who is not in the House today because of the contempt with which he treats the Australian parliament; the very same person who toldâ€”I thought this was a classicâ€”his backbench to get on to the radio yesterday after his incredible performance with John Laws just a week before when he made that memorable comment `what are they on about' when people were complaining about the state of the Australian economy; the very same person who said of question time that it was an indulgence given by the government for the benefit of the opposition; the very same person who calls the people's representatives in the Senate `unrepresentative swill'; and the very same person who made the incredible statement yesterday that his government deserved to be re-elected.

         We contest that statement. We say that the failure of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to step aside and/or for the Prime Minister to require her to step aside is a classic example of the rotten, corrupting, contemptible arrogance which is at the heart of this government, at the soul of this government and which the Australian people are so sick to death of.

         Our basic point is that she should now step aside. There are basically four reasons. The first is one that she herself would now understand as a matter of commonsense. I call it the `you can't hold a doorstop without being pressured' syndrome. The reality is that this is a minister whose ability to perform her ministerial abilities has been totally prejudiced and compromised by the Penny Easton affair.

         Recapping the first reason, the minister is clearly incapable of performing her duties. The second reason is that we now have a range of persons and interest groups from the health industry who are expressing their views to the effect that she is unable to continue in her portfolio. A third reason is that there is ample precedence for ministers under pressure similar to that which the current minister is under to step aside pending an investigation.

         you can go back to the 1940s when Eddie Ward was subject to a royal commission inquiry into the Brisbane Line. Eddie Ward, again, in 1949â€”this is a relevant example and precedent because he was from the Labor side of politicsâ€”stepped aside and was relieved of his administrative duties during the royal commission inquiries into allegations of corrupt allocation of timber licences in Papua New Guinea. More recently, during the Fraser administration, in 1978 the Minister for Finance, Eric Robinson, was given leave from ministerial duties during royal commission inquiries into electoral redistribution in Queensland.

         Back on the Labor side, we have precedents not just at the federal level but also at the state level. Again more recently, this time in the 1980s, Neville Wran, when he was Premier of New South Wales, stood aside during the conduct of the royal commission headed by Sir Laurence Street into allegations of interference in the running of New South Wales Rugby League. He stood aside; he did the right thing. There was no question in his mind, given the fact that the royal commission went to activities with which he was associated, that it was right and proper for him to step aside. A third, quite compelling reason is that there is ample precedent for a minister to step aside under these circumstances.

         Also at the political level, I do not think there is any doubt that, from a Labor perspective, there is an assessment now that the Minister for Human Services and Health is extracting a very high price for her continued position in the ministry. Let us face it: in politics, the assessment of political damage to your own side is a legitimate basis upon which ministers have stood aside in the past.

         There is a very clear case for this minister to step aside. For that reason, the standing and sessional orders ought to be suspended so that that motion can be put to the House. The truth of the matter is that the minister is a liability, obviously going to the matters which are before the Marks royal commission in Western Australia. I do not go to those matters. I am conscious of the sub judice rule. It is our basic position that those matters are properly before the commission. They ought to be properly addressed in the commission and the commission in due course will come to its own conclusions. But you cannot deny that there has been an avalanche of evidence in recent days, all of which has contradicted a statement which the minister herself has made.

         The other matter which I think is critical and should be taken into consideration is the allied controversy about the processes which the government adopted to fund this minister's legal costs. I think it is an absolute outrage that this government has just abandoned all precedent. They have abandoned the ministerial guidelines, which establish the basis upon which ministers are funded, and have set up a process by which her legal costs will be funded on a discretionary decision of the Minister for Finance, a senior Western Australian whose political interests it is to serve by promoting her defence.

         That brings me to this conclusion: this is a classic cameo performance from the Labor Party. When it comes to legal costs, as usual they cannot distinguish between the national interest and the interests of the Labor Party. For that reason, the standing orders ought to be suspended to allow the motion to be put.

         The second legal case relates to a view expressed by a legal academic who is a reader in law at Melbourne University specialising in constitutional law, Mr Geoff Lindell. He has questioned whether the cabinet decision fell foul of a High Court ruling in 1989, when the High Court ruled that the power of appropriation reposed solely in parliament. Our constitution assures to the people the effective control of the public purse through parliament. The government's answer to that is that the money has been provided through the Advance to the Minister for Finance, but the guidelines for the Advance to the Minister for Finance say that moneys under that item should only be used:

         The third reasonâ€”the political reasonâ€”is more fundamental. The political reason why the minister should stand aside is that successive prime ministers and premiers have accepted that, when a minister misleads a parliament, the minister has committed that fundamental political sin and should no longer occupy the position of minister. Neville Wran laid down that principle; Gough Whitlam accepted it; Bob Hawke accepted it; and Malcolm Fraser certainly pursued it. Remember Ros Kelly and the whiteboard incident? Paul Keating applied that dogma.

         Why should that doctrine not apply to the Minister for Human Services and Health? Because the matter is in Western Australia? This royal commission was constituted to determine whether or not the minister committed that fundamental political sinâ€”whether or not she as Premier misled the Western Australian parliament. That is what the royal commission is all aboutâ€”why, and on what basis, is the Advance to the Minister for Finance being used to fund that prosecution? Why, when successive cases launched by the minister have failed, should legal expenses still be paid? Mind you, the plot thickens, but I have not got the time to go into all the detail. It is interesting that the firm representing the minister is the same one that Senator Loosley, a former senator for New South Wales, has joined.

         It is of interest to note that the case seems more and more to be one which rouses the ire of the public. In the latest Herald McNair poll, 77 per cent of the public disagreed with funding by the government. It is also of interest that the government is not prepared to fund similar sorts of action being launched by Brendon Kelson and Michael McKernan with respect to the War Memorial. Each of those men are distinguished public servants. Their matters were launched in quite extraordinary ways by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, with the minister responsible, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), not even being advised of the prosecution.

         On the question of whether or not this constitutes a vast waste of public funds, I am prepared to concede the point that it does. There is no question about that. This entire royal commission is a vast illegitimate waste of public funds, and in the first instance the bill for the representation for our minister is being sent to the Western Australian government which has announced, but not yet responded to us, that it is prepared to meet legal expenses. We await a response from the Western Australian government in that regard before it activates any decisions made by the government in support of our minister.

         Though it is difficult to imagine, there was a time when even Fred Daly was young. First elected to Federal Parliament in 1943, he was so raw, he said, that he took people who visited him in Canberra to the cafe in the main street for bangers and mash.

         When I arrived here as the member for Parramatta in 1973 it was quite interesting that, although he campaigned vigorously against meâ€”I even know at what booth I saw him on the day of the by-election; it was the Epping School of Artsâ€”he was one of the first to welcome me to Parliament House. As I was elected in a by-election, he, along with then Speaker Cope, arranged a small function for people to meet me and to make me feel very much at home.

         I must say that he did say to my wife that, while welcoming us, he did not wish me a long stay. That sense of humour was well understood as I was holding what was seen then to be a marginal seat. I guess that he really did not wish me a long stay but, while I cannot say I am rivalling him, 20 years having passed, I feel I have in some way proved him wrong.

         In a sense I followed what he did as a minister quite closely because he had responsibility for electoral matters. I note that he was the member for Martin and the member for Grayndler and at times had to contest a number of ballots, even after redistribution, to remain in the parliament as long as he did. Many of us who have suffered the vagaries of redistribution will have noted how adroitly he managed to achieve that and it is an example that some of us have tried to emulate.

         Fred Daly was a person of remarkable skills and remarkable humour. He was one who did have a life beyond this parliament, which many politicians do not have. I noticed in my mail this week that I received an invitation to a function here at Parliament House organised by the aged-care community in which they, having printed their invitations some weeks ago, had included Fred as a principal speaker.

         â€”I guess one of my earliest political memories was when I was about 10 or 12 years of age helping my father hand out Labor how-to-vote cards at the Globe Kindergarten in Perry Street, Marrickville, for Fred Daly in a federal election. As I got a little older and went to high school I was in the same class as Lawrie Daly. I remember as a young lad at that schoolâ€”De La Salle, Marrickvilleâ€”that the nicest and most consistent person who worked on the school tuckshop was Mrs Daly.

         At Fred's funeral, which was certainly not so much a time of unhappiness but a genuine celebration of a good person's life, the things that were said by Terry Sheahan, the President of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and the parish priest, Father Tom, were genuine heartfelt things about Fred Daly, who had been the local member for that area from 1949 to 1975.

         Fred was very much an old-fashioned member of parliament. He worked hard in his constituency. Members of parliament in those days probably did a lot more electioneering than we do now. They did not have all the electorate secretaries that members now have. They did not have all the telephones, direct mail, faxes and all that. What they actually did was what members of parliament probably should be doing now, which was getting around the local area and providing a service to the people who lived in that area. Electorates in those days were a lot smaller and the Grayndler electorate was basically the suburbs of Marrickville, Enmore, a bit of Dulwich Hill and that area. Fred Daly was a byword in the area.

         As Father Tom said at the funeral, the Labor Party and the Catholic Church in Marrickville were pretty much one and the same. The story told about a woman called Mrs O'Connor, who mistakenly genuflected when she came into a meeting of the central Marrickville branch, is probably true, because when I arrived at the church and walked in the door on the morning of Fred's funeral I was met by one of the church wardens handing out the order of service who happened to be a fellow called Claude Danzy, who had been a long-term vice-president of the Central Marrickville branch of the Labor Party.

         Of the people who were there at the funeralâ€”the local people as well as the people who knew Fred both in politics and in other parts of his public lifeâ€”the local people were the ones I think Fred would have been most glad to see there. It is a credit to the thoughts of his family that they had what has been the largest state funeral in Sydney in recent years not in the cathedral, where those things are usually held, but in Fred's local parish church, St Brigid's at Marrickville, because Fred Daly saw his role as the member for Grayndler as probably more important than any other job he had done in his lifeâ€”other than maybe rugby league.

         I think I ought to set the record straight in one small way. There has been a lot of alluding here today and in the press earlier to Fred's love of the game of rugby league, which is certainly very true. People mention how wonderful it was that three of the pallbearers at his funeral were people who play for the Raidersâ€”Laurie Daley and two other Raiders players. What they forget is that there were three other pallbearers at the funeral who were former players for the Newtown Rugby League Club. One of those pallbearers who was a particularly fond friend of Fred's was Frank Farrington, who was a long-term secretary of that club.

         It is an interesting point for members to know that Fred, on the day he died, had come down to Sydney from Canberra to attend a fundraising function for the Newtown Rugby League Club, which was held that night down at South Sydney Leagues Club because Newtown is a much smaller club than it was in Fred's day and plays in the Metropolitan Cup competition. Fred still maintained his contact with that club, and a book they put out that night talked about the leagues club and its connection with the Labor Party. So the three things in Fred Daly's public lifeâ€”the church, the Labor Party and the football clubâ€”are very much intermingled.

         Fred's family were very active at the grassroots level. Fred's son, Lawrie, rather interestingly followed me as the assistant secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales, as I had followed his father as the member for Grayndler. Since the division of Grayndler was formed in 1949 there have been only five members for Grayndler. Fred Daly was the member from 1949 to 1975; Tony Whitlam, from 1975 to 1977; Frank Stewart, from 1977 to 1979; me, from 1979 to 1993; and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mrs McHugh, from 1993 until now.

I think that is a sad thing in a lot of ways, because those of us who have been here for a little while probably miss the characters that there were in the parliament who do not seem to be here now. I know that if Fred were still a member of parliament he would not like this chamber. It certainly does not have the same intimacy as the chamber in the old building had which I think allowed that cut and thrust that made those great debaters perform better than this chamber allows us to.

         Fred Daly is a person who is missed most particularly by the people who knew him down in Marrickville and by the people in the party in his area. Some of the people who were his lieutenants in the partyâ€”I got to know them as I grew up in Marrickville and as the local memberâ€”were people who stuck to Fred through thick and thin and were absolutely loyal to both him and the Labor Party: people like Reg Willard and a terribly interesting fellow, who probably in the past I have never called an interesting fellow, by the name of Jimmy O'Halloran, who had been the returning officer for Fred's electorate council for many years. O'Halloran always used to boast that no-one was ever going to beat Daly as long as he was the returning officer. Daly's enemies never quite knew whether they should try to get rid of O'Halloran first or Daly first.

         Fred was a fellow who, over the years, showed young people in the party such as me that he had seen the hard times of the Labor Party. He had a brief time as a minister, when he achieved some of the things he looked forward all his political life to doing. Unlike a lot of us when we retire from this place, Fred was able to make the transition to retirement very well and was able to come back here and pass on to people some of the things that he had learnt as a member.

         Fred was also always able to pass on some good humour. As a couple of people have mentioned, he would burst into your office with people on his interesting tour and say, `This is so and so. I have known him all my life. You really want to meet these people, don't you?' You would think, `My goodness, of course I want to meet them, Fred. They are obviously your relations too.' He had that infectious ability to put people at ease and to impart, through humour, a very good message.

         As I said earlier, Fred's funeral was a celebration of his life. I do not think his funeral could have been better if he had organised it himself. Some people suggest he probably was orchestrating it from heaven anyway. Fred Daly was certainly in that great tradition of Irish Catholic Labor members of parliament who have enriched both our party and this country. He will be missed by all those who knew him. Gone with Fred Daly's passing is not only a link with the history of Australia, with his link with the Curtin government, but also the little bit of light that used to shine into our lives as he went around the building from time to time. I used to argue with him and fight with him, and I will miss him terribly.

         â€”Fred Daly will never die, at least not until the last person touched by his life has passed on. I think all of us who were present a few days ago at St Brigid's for the requiem mass would appreciate the significance of some 600 to 700 ordinary Australians being present. Sure, at the top of the church there were former prime ministers, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Governor-General, a squad of ministers and numerous other mere mortals like us. But the hundreds of people that were there were not there to honour Fred Daly, former minister; they were there to honour Fred Daly, their friend, their mate and their supporter.

         As we have been told, throughout Fred's political life, some 30 years in parliament, he lived through, as did many of his constituents, some of the most difficult days that Australia has ever knownâ€”the Depression, the Second World War and the need to reorganise the nation that followed it. In all of that, Fred had 23 years in opposition. Having had nearly 13 years of my own in opposition, I sympathise deeply with people who have had that experience.

         Throughout those years Fred demonstrated a degree of sagacity, determination and reliability which is quite unique in political terms. There are very few of us in the chamber now who have any personal experience of working either alongside or opposite Fred Daly, member of parliament, minister, Leader of the House and colleague. I am one of those fortunate enough to say that I have been touched by Fred. He often gave us harsh medicine, but he did so with a smile and a joke. While many of us had to bear the brunt of his tongue on occasions, I do not recall anybody ever doing it without a smile. That is a very rare trait which he was undoubtedly able to demonstrate.

         As has been pointed out by the government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), at St Brigid's the other day, when we saw all those people, there was a celebration of Fred's life. It was indeed. One could go a little further and say it almost had, shall we say, the characteristics of an Irish wake about it. As the parish priest told us, in Ireland on that very same day a requiem mass was also being said for Fred, again to emphasise the linkage between his past, his present and no doubt his future. Fred was indeed an Irish Catholic of which the church could be very proud. He did in turn give of his best for his God, his faith, his party and his football team. All the things that were important to him, to his community and to the people he represented Fred stood for as well.

         What touched me in the eulogy from the altar was the emphasis given to his wife, who, throughout the years which they lived together, was simply known as `Mrs Daly'. The respect shown to her epitomised in a very real sense the love and the devotion of that married couple on the one hand, and on the other the way in which both of them together had managed to forge in a political environment a relationship with their constituents which reached its fulsome totality at that mass at St Brigid's on that day.

Last May, when I faced my political Garden of Gethsemane, if I may use that term, Fred rang me up twice before the event and he phoned me once afterwards, which I thought was an extraordinarily kind, generous and sympathetic gesture from a fellow human being who understood the realities of political life and its ups and its downsâ€”and for all of us ultimately it is a down. There he was, lending me his support and his hand at a time when I certainly wanted it.

         The point has been made, and I just want to reiterate it, that in the context of parliament Fred was a great reformer of parliament. He did certainly change the sittings of parliament and the conditions under which members of parliament have had to work since. I want all of those who have come in since Fred was here to remember that he was the person who made the changes from which we have all benefited. The conditions of parliamentary service were significantly improved because Fred realised, after having spent so many years here and seen what the benefits of ministerial service were on the one side compared with the obvious penury of being on the back bench on the other, that there needed to be a rebalancing, and he carried it through. In those two acts, while at the time he was criticised for themâ€”of course, every time there is a parliamentary salary increase there is always criticismâ€”nevertheless he realised that for the benefit of service of the parliament it was necessary that those who worked within it did so under reasonable conditions.

         To many of us, when we first came to this place Fred Daly was a guide and a teacher. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat referred to Fred making assistance available to members. I came into this parliament as one of the Whitlam team in December 1972. When we first met in February 1973, there was none of the assistance available to members, particularly to new members, that is available to members and new members today. We were parcelled into a room, given a pad, some writing implements and a telephone and that was it. There was no guide for getting around the house. It was a feat to find your way around Old Parliament House. I asked for a map or for some sort of chart to find my way around the house because it was much more of a labyrinth than this place is, but there was no chart or layout of the parliamentary building available. We were just thrown in the deep end and sank or swam on our own efforts.

He did not have much of a brief for the narrow specialists who were around at that time. He wanted more people with a generalist background who could support any issue that arose on any subject that arose.

They were the very basic things we needed to know to carry out the work that we were sent here to do.

Fred Daly played a very important role in his great love; his great love was the parliament. He had a wonderful belief in the parliamentary processâ€”the practising of parliament itself. Many members who came through this place have a great deal to thank Fred Daly for. I put it down to the fact that he had experienced hardship himself.

         One of the wonderful aspects of Fred's character was that as a Labor man he never forgot his roots. He never ceased to be a humble Australian. As a former member of parliament, he kept a very active interest in the political scene. It was not unusual to get a phone call or a visit from Fred in the old House or in this House and be told what was going on. I admired his faculty, his sharp grasp and his distinctive feel for what the public were thinking, what was a good issue, what was being handled well and what was not being handled well. Right to his last days, he retained that capacity. I thought that was a wonderful trait of character and he had a wonderful aptitude.

         Fred Daly maintained that strong interest in political events. He loved the parliamentary scene, as I have referred to. You had to really see his humour in the old House to understand it. If you are looking for a speech that would be the most uproarious speech ever made in parliament, it was the speech he made in May 1973. I will go over the background of that speech made in the old House. The opposition had attended some kind of dinner or function during the tea break. We broke from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. The debate before the break had been a bit hot and a bit vivid. Fred came in after 8 o'clock to settle things down. Some of our colleagues on the opposite side of the House in the old chamber were a little relaxed. They were not tired and emotional, but a number of them were certainly a bit flushed faced and a little relaxed.

         When Fred came into the debate it was the most uproarious 20 minutes that one would ever hear in the parliament. In it he described the courtship of Vince Gair by Doug Anthony. Only he described it as the courtship by the National Party of the DLP. That was happening at that time. Fred managed to translate it and describe it as the courtship of the old whore by this shiny young man with this great blonde tuft of hair. What a handsome young man he was. During the debate, he became so agitated that he almost finished on the wrong side of the table as he walked up and down the chamber describing all of these events that were taking place. He said what a wonderful wedding it was going to be when finally the old whore was churched by this shining young man.

         I recommend reading that speech very strongly. I was sore from laughing during that speech. It was Fred Daly at his absolute best. It is probably the classic of how humour can be used in a fun way. Underneath that humour of Fred Daly, there was an underpinning of serious business. He had a debate to cool down and an argument to cool down. He did it with humour, but undermined it completely in a way that nobody could take offence at. Both sides of the House were in continuous laughter at the argument that he put and the descriptions he made to it.

On the last occasion in which he spoke in my electorate he talked about the ghosts of Parliament House. I am quite sure that the spirit of Fred Daly will long inhabit the old Parliament House down the hill.

Fred Daly was sure that Jim Killen stole his jokes. I suppose I can say nowâ€”I am sure Jim Killen will not mindâ€”that there was an occasion when I had a brilliant idea. I thought what a wonderful night it would be if we got both of them together on the one platform. They could regale the gathering with their reminiscences of their funny times and funny experiences of political life. But I learnt after that that was mission impossible. I learnt why it was impossible to get both of them together on that kind of platform. They had that rivalry and good humour between political opponents that we do not see in this place today. Today it is a much more dour parliament, a much more bitter parliament, a parliament without humour and certainly with much less of the goodwill that was the parliament of the time of Fred Daly and Jim Killen. At the funeral I said to Jim Killen afterwards, `Jim, you've lost your partner.' He said, `No, I've got an advocate in the place that you haven't got one.'

We know, as members of parliament, that you would have been without your father and grandfather on many occasions when you would dearly have loved to have him with you. We thank you for that and we revere the memory of Fred Daly and appreciate the contribution he has made to our Australian way of life.

         â€”The special qualities of Fred Daly endeared him to three generations of Australians. He was elected first of all to the federal parliament in 1943 as the member for Martin, and he retired from the federal parliament as the member for Grayndler in 1975. He died in 1995, at the age of 83.

         Fred Daly was 31 years of age when he was elected to the federal parliament. He remained a member of the federal parliament for 32 years. Very few people have the opportunity to serve their constituents, their electorate and the wider community for as long as that.

         Fred Daly's great mate Jim Killen often referred to the fact that Fred used humour as a political weapon. There are very few who have the capacity to do that. Fred Daly had a magnificent repertoire of anecdotes and quotable quotes. Some of those quotes were his own; other quotes belonged to other people. One I would like to refer to is this. Fred said, `If you want to be an expert you don't need to have gone to school; you just need to have outlived everybody.' He sought to do that himself, I am sure. He clearly pursued that objective. He was the last surviving link with the Curtin government but, even within his own family, he outlived eight of his 10 siblings. Only Hilda and Cannice have seen him out.

The particular thing that I noticed about that was that `Faith' was spelt with a capital F. That means that either Fred asked that that be included in his funeral notice or those people who knew Fred best included that expression and spelt `Faith' with a capital F with the intention of having that statement `I have kept the Faith' refer to both his Catholic faith and to his faith in the Labor Party and the Labor movement. Let me say to Lawrie, Margaret, Anne and the childrenâ€”the grandchildrenâ€”that Fred Daly did keep the faith.

I said that we would get more public attention and more media coverage if we got Sir John to officially open the campaign rooms. I said the headlines then were more likely to be `Man bites dog'.

         As has often been said, Fred Daly was originally regarded as a `oncer'. He won the seat of Martin in 1943 under extraordinary circumstances. The Labor Party had a quite unprecedented swing in its favour. Soon after, Fred went away on an overseas study tour. In those days, MPs generally travelled by ship. It was a very lengthy procedure. It was regarded as very hazardous for an MP in a marginal seat to go away on a long excursion. Because of this excursion, he acquired the sobriquet of `Dilly Dally Daly', which took him a long time to live down. That was used against him in the 1946 election, but it did not seem to hurt him too much; he was able to hang on. Of course, with subsequent redistributions he certainly had a better seat.

There was an extraordinary period of bitterness in the party. Many people did not speak to each other, as is the case with some parties at the moment which shall remain nameless. At that time, there was a great deal of bitterness in Labor. Dr Evatt, it has to be said, was not the world's easiest leader to serve.

In those days, people actually listened to the parliamentary broadcasts. It was a long time agoâ€”before television. Dr Evatt said to Fred Daly, `I want you to go down and see Les Haylen'â€”a prominent member of the Leftâ€”`and tell him that there's a big foreign affairs debate coming on tonight. I won't lead for the opposition. It's on at 8 o'clock, which is the best time for listeners. I want you to go down and tell Les Haylen that he is to lead for the opposition.' Fred Daly said, `Well, I thought Les was a bit on the nose with you, Doc?' Dr Evatt said, `No, that's all right. Tell him that all is forgiven and that I want him to give the speech of his lifetime.' Fred Daly went down to see Haylen. When he came back, Evatt asked, `How did you get on?' Fred said, `It's all right. He was very excited. He said to say thank you, that he'd never forget it, that he was very grateful and that he would indeed make the speech of his lifetime.' Evatt said, `Good. Now I want you to go and see Kim Beazley and tell him the same thing.' The task of the Whip was not easy in such circumstances. Of course, he was referring to Kim Beazley Sr.

We certainly cannot do without the professional skills, nor can the Liberal and National parties.

He participated in many of those changes, but he recognised the importance of maintaining that community base. That is what political activity is all about; it is its whole rationale.

Between 1956 and 1967, for 11 years, he held no formal position with the Labor Party opposition, not as whip, not as a member of the executive but as a backbencherâ€”more or less in the opposition group during a period of Labor in oppositionâ€”because of that bitterness, the falling out with Evatt and the controversy that followed.

That is not to say that he was not an effective parliamentarian. In fact, he was a truly great member of parliament in the proper sense, but Fred contributed so much in the last 20 years of his life. In fact, as Gough Whitlam pointed out, he never truly left public life. He was always putting so much more back in, back into the Labor Party.

         I come back again to the use of the Commonwealth car. Poor Mr Khemlani. He had come all the way from Singapore at his own cost and without a visa to clear his name and he had all that excess baggage with him. What must he think of Australia? His life was endangered by high speed car chases in Commonwealth cars, his bags were searched by bearded investigatorsâ€”as far as we know they were not false beardsâ€”and he was booked into a $23 a night room next to a shoe shine box, yet his bags were booked into a $33 a night international hotel.

        I think that is a very good passage that gives great memories of the flavour and the colourful character of Fred Daly and the sort of contribution he made in this place. I take a lesson from that, as I am sure all members of parliament do, that Daly's use of humour and ridicule with goodwill were very important. It gives an important lesson for today's parliamentarians.

         Reflecting further on Fred Daly's life, one of the things I have tried to follow in my lifeâ€”and I think members would relate to thisâ€”is the ideal of service to family, community and nation. Fred Daly did these three things so effectively, but he did so much more. This is the message I took from his state funeral in understanding his lifeâ€”the faith, the loyalty and the service he displayed not only to family, community and nation but also to his party, the Australian Labor Party; to his union, the Federated Clerks Union; to his church, the Catholic Church; and to his football teams, Newtown and the mighty Canberra Raiders.

         He led a big lifeâ€”a life that was full of faith, full of loyalty and full of service to each of those seven institutions. We now associate with Fred Daly all the best features of Australian parliamentary debateâ€”the sharp wit and the goodwill. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned that wherever Fred is right nowâ€”and by his faith it is with his makerâ€”he would be taking great interest in these proceedings. In spirit, he is sure to take great interest and pride in his son Lawrie's career, as he has always done in the past. I hope and trust, as do many other members, that Lawrie will soon enter the New South Wales parliament.

         A couple of days later I referred to this in my first speech. Some time subsequently, Bray Gray, the widow of former member for Capricornia George Gray, visited Canberra and went on one of Fred's tours. Most fortunately, Fred was taking the tour personally, as we know he did on so many occasions. Fred's comment to Bray was, `I knew you weren't dead because the little girl from Capricornia mentioned you in her maiden speech.' I took it as a great compliment that he had remembered me at all. Whereas I might bridle at times at comments such as that from some of my colleagues, from Fred, who I found to be an absolutely darling man, it was a great compliment.

The most recent communication I had from Fred was a faxed letter on 28 July confirming his phone call to say that he was not able to come up to our proposed dinner because his health had not been so good.

        I guess that is what we could say about Fred himself. It has been a privilege to hear so many expressions, from both sides of the House, about the nature of Fred Daly. One of the things I was also very disappointed about was my inability to attend his funeral. It was something I would love to have done, but I had already a number of very important commitments in my electorate that related to issues such as the Australia Remembers program. I thought to myself that I know Fred would have valued the fact that I was putting off a personal need to attend what was obviously a marvellous tribute to him, his funeral service in Marrickville, to do what he would expect a Labor member to do; that is, be with my constituents and continue representing the Labor Party and continuing its finest traditions. I had to content myself with that thought when, personally, I would love to have been there to pay personal tribute.

         His passing is a great sadness to us all. I think we tended to feel that he was quite indestructible and would be with us forever. That, of course, has proven not to be true. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he was that last link with the Curtin government. We will all be diminished by that loss, but for all that he gave to all of us personallyâ€”his wit, his good humour, his compassion, his humanityâ€”we have all been enriched.

The special relationship with Fred was that he was my Raving Ambassador and Minister Plenipotentiary. We had a whale of a time together.

What you do is go out very early with your piece of chain and your padlock and you chain them up so that nobody else can get in.'

         I turn now to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, which emerges from a case known as the Ridgeway case, which was recently determined in the High Court. Essentially, as I understand them, the facts were that a person, a Mr Ridgeway, was in prison for other matters and he met there another person who, I believe from memory, was a Malaysian national. They entered into a scheme to import heroin from Malaysia into Australia. Unknown to Mr Ridgeway, the person with whom he entered into the scheme was in fact a police informer, who, on his return to Malaysia, informed the Malaysian police of the scheme. They, in turn, informed the Australian Federal Police, who then entered into a scheme to import heroin into Australia to, in effect, enact the intended parts of the crime in order to ensure that Mr Ridgeway could be apprehended and charged with the relevant offences.

         What followed was that the matter ended up in the High Court, where the court determined that the existing administrative arrangements that applied to giving exemption to police conducting these sorts of activities in order to apprehend an offender did not provide sufficient basis for immunity, nor did they effectively enable evidence to be admitted that was illegally obtained. Therefore, the obvious consequence of this decision was that a legislative basis needed to be established to ensure that activities of this nature could continue to be conducted by the police in order to ensure, ultimately, that people could be apprehended.

         The bill proposes that the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner, or a member of the National Crime Authority, can provide a certificate of authorisation which would permit members of the Australian Federal Police to engage in activity, which would otherwise be criminal, in order to bring about the arrest and conviction of a person engaged in, or intending to engage in, activities in contravention of section 233B of the Customs Act 1901â€”in other words, the importation of prohibited substances.

         A number of tests apply with respect to the provision of this certificate. It is only available, obviously, if all relevant information is provided to the decision making party. It applies only where the person concerned is `likely to commit an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or an associated offence whether or not the operation takes place,' the operation being, of course, the police intervention.

         It is no secret that this situation caused some interesting debate within the government about the appropriate response to the dilemma that had been raised by the Ridgeway case. I was an active participant in that debate. There were a number of concerns about how the government should proceed. I still share some concerns about this legislation; I will get to those in a moment. But I do not believe that some of the concerns that have been raised have any great foundation, and I would like to comment on a couple of those.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Firstly, I concur with the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) who in his earlier contribution said that retrospectivity is not really a concern. Although there is a technically retrospective aspect to the legislation, it is not such that it would give rise to concern of the usual type which most of us do raise when issues of retrospectivity are involved.

         Secondly, there has been some suggestion that in some way this legislation may be unconstitutional. I do not accept that suggestion. I see no basis on which this legislation could be challenged in the High Court as being in breach of the constitution.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, it has been suggested that, rather than the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner having the responsibility for issuing certificates authorising the relevant behaviour, it would be better if it were performed as a judicial function. I have some serious concerns about that suggestion. First, it would have to be handed over to the states, because chapter III of the constitution would prevent the federal judicial bodies from conducting that sort of activity because it is a non-judicial activity, and there would be significant problems in making arrangements with the states to do that. But, more importantly, it starts to blur the role of the judge, the role of a court, and it almost tends to drift into the area of giving advisory opinions, so that, in effect, what you would be doing would be asking a judge to give a preliminary opinion about whether certain types of conduct by the police would be within or outside the law with regard to a particular drug operation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In my view, to take these sorts of things to the courts to obtain certificates appears at first glance to be very good protection against potential abuse. But we need to keep in mind that ultimately the role of the courts is to make judicial decisions; to decide actual cases, live matters. If you start loading up the courts with administrative functions of this nature, a gradual perversion of the role of the court potentially threatens. So I do not have concerns about those matters.

         As I indicated, there are some concerns that I would like to raise. The first is the question of entrapment. In my view, the Australian legal system, in the various state guises and federally, has always on balance got the issue of entrapment reasonably right. It is a very difficult and complicated legal issue. Clearly, at one end of an extreme spectrum we do not want to have a situation where virtually the whole of an offence is committed, caused or provoked by a police officer, undercover or overt, in order to obtain a conviction. Equally, at the other end of the spectrum we do not want to see obvious wrongdoers getting off scot-free because of some technical exclusion of a piece of evidence because it is seen to be entrapment. The view that the Australian courts have adopted generally on this issue has been reasonably balanced and accurate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The difficulty in the Ridgeway case, on my understanding of the facts, is that, had the police not intervened, the crime could not have happened. The reason it could not have happened was that the co-conspirator was a police informer and his role was essential to the commission of the crime because he was to obtain the heroin overseas and bring it into Australia. So, without the intervention of the police, the offence concerned would not have been possible; it could not have happened.

         To give an analogy, if you want to look at this from another angle, consider these circumstances for argument's sake. Suppose I express an interest in committing a bank robbery and the police then say, `Well, okay, we'll give you a gun, we'll provide you with a getaway vehicle and here's a map of the layout of the bank; we'll give you a bit of help to make sure that we can then get there and bust you for that particular crime.' Obviously people would be extremely unhappy if the police were engaging in that sort of thing.

         There is a serious public policy question here: to what extent should the police intervene in such a way that, even if there were to be an apprehension at the end of the process, their intervention actually causes something to happen which otherwise would not have happened? The critical test or issue in providing a cover for police to conduct illegal acts is that question of whether or not the offence still would have occurred. There is an old problem in criminal law with these types of things: at what point do you intervene? The equivalent problem, for example, may be found in the law of attempts: the issue of impossibility. The most classic illustration of that is the fact that you cannot charge with murder somebody who stabs a corpse because, even though they clearly have intended to kill the person, it was impossible to do so because they were already dead.

         If this legislation is read broadly and is intended to cover the specific situation that prevailed in the Ridgeway case, then the criminal offence which would never have occurred will, in effect, be extended as a result of police intervention to actual eventuation. There is a critical issue involved in this, and that is in what circumstances where you have little more than an expressed intent and, ultimately, what otherwise would have been a frustrated attempt to bring that intent into actuality should police intervene to ensure that the crime actually happens so that the perpetrators can then be apprehended? It is not clear in my mind how far the bill goes and whether it really does cover this particular situation.

        The critical question is: does this mean any offence of this type or does it mean this particular offence? Using the heroin importation example, does it mean that in order for this certification to apply the police have to convince the commissioner, deputy commissioner or whomever that, even if they do not intervene, this particular contemplated offence will still happen? Or does it mean that all they have to do is convince the commissioner et cetera that, even if this particular offence will not happen, an offence of this nature will happen at some future time? In other words, the person concerned is clearly somebody who has a long-term agenda of importing heroin and, if this scheme does not come off, they will be back in a few months with another scheme with somebody else doing roughly the same thing.

         If read broadly, this provision would ultimately, in my view, lead to prosecuting people in effect for exhibiting a propensity to commit a criminal offence. In other words, by initiating one attempt to import heroin which otherwise clearly would have failed at first base, that person has demonstrated a propensity to engage in that sort of criminal behaviour. Therefore, what the police will do is conduct a pre-emptive strike, intervene, to make sure that what otherwise would have failed will actually happen in the case of the original scheme, and they will then apprehend, charge and convict the person concerned on the basis that, if they had not done so, the person would have gone ahead and attempted to do that sort of thing at some other time.

         The question we have to ask ourselves in this issue is: how far should this extend; to what extent should police take the role of flushing out likely offenders? If you have lost your licence, for example, and have been placed on a bond which includes a requirement not to drink, would it be appropriate for the local cop to go down the pub with you and shout you a few beers to try to get you to break your bond so that he or she could then go to the magistrates court and say, `Well, look, they've broken their bond, they shouldn't be allowed back in a car.' This goes dangerously close to deeming criminality and then orchestrating events to produce the anticipated criminal outcome.

         If, on the other hand, clause 15M(b) is read narrowly, then it is a different and much more appropriate story. But we should remember that if it is read narrowly then, in my view, the facts in the Ridgeway case are not coveredâ€”that in that particular situation, a certificate would not be available. The explanatory memorandum, which is attached to the legislation, says:

        That to me suggests that the narrower interpretation of that particular limb of the test is probably the correct one. I suspect that this ambiguity will probably end up in the High Court as subsequent litigation of the Ridgeway situation. But if it is the narrow limb that is involved and, in effect, the whole scheme of controlled operations has effectively been wiped out by the Ridgeway decision, and the government is endeavouring to resume that scheme but not specifically to target the Ridgeway type situation, then I have no problem.

         The second issue where I have a concern about this, particularly if the broad interpretation of that provision will apply, is the question of police corruption. Obviously none of us needs to say very much about this issue; it is a substantial problem not only in this country but in many other countries. There is a big risk that, by extending to the police the scope of controlled operations to include exclusive control over virtually the entire process of drug importation, a number of opportunities for corruption will be opened up. For example, when drugs are purchased, particularly overseas, a police officer may decide to siphon off some of the purchased drugs, falsify the amount purchased and then sell the difference and continue with the controlled operation. They could set up a drug running operation under the cover of such operations. They could even go into collusion with an alleged suspect in order to run such an operation.

         My final comment is on the broader issue, which ultimately is the cause of this situation being a problem for the government in the first placeâ€”and that is, the so-called war on drugs. This is yet another example of long established principles of criminal law being altered in order to fit with the imperatives of the so-called war on drugsâ€”the prohibition framework to try to stamp out the use of illicit drugs in our society. It is not the only circumstance in which those sorts of changes occurâ€”motor vehicles is the other prominent areaâ€”but it is still the major area of perversion of the criminal law. A classic example of that is the issue of deeming of trafficable quantities so that the onus of proof is reversed: if you have a certain quantity of a particular drug in your possession, you are deemed to be trafficking, unless you can prove otherwiseâ€”a clear perversion of a basic principle of the criminal law which is there for very practical reasons.

         We have to come to terms with the fact that the prohibition model has failed and that it has produced massive organised crime problems and substantially increased police corruption. The major problems of drug abuse tend to have a connection with the prohibition modelâ€”impurities and variable qualityâ€”and also widespread middle-level and petty crime, robberies and things of that nature to fund the very high prices that a black market in drugs produces. There are enormous costs to the government through policing and to the real economy, the legal economy, because of the diversion of huge amounts of consumer dollars out of the real economy into the black economy to buy drugs.

         I do not favour full legalisation. If we allowed the advertising industry to get its hands on many of the drugs that are currently illegal, consumption would increase, which would be a problem. Somewhere between the current war on drugs and the prohibition model, which clearly has not worked and is causing enormous problems, at one extreme and full legalisation at the other is an appropriate model which ensures that we can tackle the health problems, minimise consumptionâ€”not criminate people for basic things that affect only them and hurt only themâ€”and also get rid of some of the outrageous problems we have with organised crime and the massive costs to the community. I would certainly urge members on the other side to give serious consideration to this issue.

         The first reason is that the illegal drug trade is an insidious evil trade. No-one would dispute that. The second reason is that it has destroyed and is destroying many lives and has had a serious impact on many areas of society in the world, including in Australiaâ€”thankfully, not so much in Australia but, as far as we know, it is still a very serious problem in certain quarters. We must never close our eyes to that. We must never relax in respect of that. We are aware that in some countries the illegal drug trade has been used for political purposesâ€”for example, in connection with the transportation of illegal drugs from South America to the United Statesâ€”and is used for political purposes with a view to fomenting disruption in society and for other agendas.

         It is also a fact that since the Ridgeway case, as I understand it, a number of very serious charges have been laid and trials are to proceed against people who allegedly have been involved in the illegal transportation into Australia of drugs of substantial quantity.

         Can I also say that I honestly do not thinkâ€”and it seems that it is not an issue any longer with anyone in this House anywayâ€”that this legislation is retrospective legislation. The offence of importation of drugs that are illegal is not in any shape or form altered by this legislation. For those people in the 10 or so cases in Australia that I understand are awaiting trial, the offence that they are charged with is in no shape or form altered by this legislation. So I see no retrospective alteration to the nature of the offence. If it were retrospective, then all of us would be wringing our hands because of the concern that we have, in the system of justice that we all support, that retrospective legislation creating a criminal offence in that area is to be resisted unless there is the most overpowering evidence. Thankfully, we are not being asked to consider that. I do not look forward to the day when we are, quite frankly.

         It is a fact of life that the issuing of warrantsâ€”to use a simple exampleâ€”is part of the legal process and is sanctioned by judiciary. The permission to issue a warrant is often obtained as a result of a judge or a magistrate being involved at the first level. Under the telecommunications interceptor law, as the member for Tangney has outlined, there is involvement of the judicial function in connection with gaining the right to intercept telecommunications signals. Of course, that right is an invasion of privacy, and judicial involvement is accepted as necessary because of this parliament's concern about the right to privacy, the fact that it is precious and it is not to be interfered with lightly. If it is to be interfered with, then let us make sure that it is done with great care and only where there is satisfactory oversight at the first level anyway.

         â€”Mr Deputy Speaker, you would think, listening to members in this House debating the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, that we have a large document in front of us with lots of words and lots of complex issues to be resolved. It is 10 pages long. It is a small bill. It is in language which even non-lawyers could read and understand without difficulty.

         It introduces the concept of a controlled operation in proposed section 15H. It has only three subsections in the definitional part which applies to section 3(1) of the Crimes Act and it is not very complex. Yet we have heard a whole lot of reasons why it should be delayed and a committee should examine it.

         Most of the arguments for delay seem to be based on a proposition that, rather than a serving police officer with senior rank authorising a controlled operation, it should be a judicial function. It is seen by some members as similar to the issue of a warrant for search, arrest, or telephone intercept under the telephone interception provisions, yet it is not. We are talking about an administrative, not a judicial, function. It is an operational function, not a judicial function.

         Warrants are issued by courts because they involve the taking away of liberty of individuals. They involve a judicial decision to take away those rights to allow a police officer to do something which is unlawful without the warrant because of the privacy or private rights of the individual. Police officers of senior rank make operational decisions on a daily basis without recourse to judges or magistrates. They are fundamentally very different matters. Indeed, there are arguments for the fact that, should it be the will of the House that it be a judicial function to authorise operations known as controlled operations, it could well be a breach of the separation of powers because it involves two totally different functions.

         In this respect I draw the attention of the House to a 1994 Federal Court decision in the case of Grollo v Bates, reported in 125 Australian Law Reports at page 492, where Justice Einfeld held that certain functions conferred on judges and magistrates by Commonwealth legislation are administrative and not judicial. He held that those functions could not validly be exercised by judges or magistrates because of the separation of powers required by the Commonwealth constitution. The provision in question was a Victorian provision allowing the extension of time for which a suspect could be held prior to Commonwealth investigation under Commonwealth law.

         It is not a simple answer to say that we should refer this matter to a committee so that it can look at whether a warrant should be issued by a judicial person before a controlled operation can take place. There is a case right on that point already in the law reports and, to me at least, there are some major complications in going down that track.

         There are other things that maybe only those of us who have had the privilege of serving in the police force can say about this type of operation, and that is that the bulk of crime is detected and convictions secured by the use of information obtained other than by brilliant detective work. Very few major cases appear before the court because the police are brilliant detectives. Major prosecutions and convictions occur because there is an informer somewhere who leaks information to police officers, who then set up an operation to drag in the evidence based on the information provided and get the brief together to secure a conviction. The bulk of policing occurs like that. They are operational decisions and operational matters.

         The bulk of convictions secured on major importations of drugs into Australia are achieved because of information received from our overseas posts. Australian Federal Police officers in listening posts around the world, cooperating with overseas police forces and sharing intelligence, hear of operations to import into Australia. But, unless they can operate to allow that transaction to take place, they will never get the people into Australia and be able to charge them before Australian courts.

         It is not much use, frankly, stopping operations in some countries where the intelligence is gathered, because you can buy your way out of those situations in most of the drug source countries. It would seem to be much more satisfactory, if we are really going to do something about this major drug trade, to get the offenders into Australia and make sure they are properly dealt with by decent laws and go where they belongâ€”into Australian gaols. You have to understand that that is the way it works.

         Last Christmas I spent some time in the United States looking at organised crime and that country's position on crime. I met with a number of Australian police officers who work from our embassies in the United States and I met with many major US police bodies, including the FBI and the DEA. I spent an engrossing four weeks looking at the American situation and the problems it faces with drug importations. This House also has to understand that we are not dealing with amateurs.

         Today, the importation of drugs around the world is controlled by a very intelligent corporate-type organisation. The methods being devised to get through Customs and the very tight controls the world is getting over target countries are very sophisticated. Some of them are so sophisticated that I do not want to talk about them in this House and tell people just how easy it is with the sophistication now available to breach the Customs barriers. If we are going to be successful, if we are going to be really serious about getting these people and slowing down the tradeâ€”in my view, it is impossible to slow down because the profits are too highâ€”and making any dent at all on the trade, we will have to be as devious and clever as they are.

It is a multibillion US dollars business. The profits are enormous. You could go to Bangkok tomorrow and it would not be difficult to buy one kilo of No. 4 heroin, pure white, the highest grade you can buy on overseas markets. Its price varies but with anywhere between $10,000 and $12,000, given the state of the market and supply at the time, you can buy yourself a kilo of pure heroin. If you can get it past the borders and into this country, you have got yourself $250,000 in cash. That is the market we are talking about. No matter what laws we pass there are people who will try to get $12,000 converted into $250,000 tax free in cash.

         This legislation permits a police officer, properly authorised by senior command, to assist in a surreptitious way an already determined activity to import into Australia in order to ensure that evidence of importation is obtained by the police so that, one, the drug does not get into the marketplace and, two, the offenders are put before a court with the evidence necessary to convict them. This legislation operationally allows the police force to set up a sting, as the Americans would call it. It is not entrapment because the offenders already have the intention to import.

         The other thing we should look at is the matter raised by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Like the member for Melbourne, I have long been a member involved in trying to get more sense into the whole drug debate in this country. The member for Melbourne and I agree on this particular area. My view is clear: until we take a pragmatic, sensible approach about the illegal drug market in Australia, we are not going to solve the problem. The reality is that any person who wants to buy an illegal drug in Australia can do so. I do not care how many laws this parliament or a state parliament passes, they are not going to change that very simple fact.

         It has been 40-odd years or more since the UN, through American pressure, forced the rest of the world into creating an illegal drug regime on drugs which were once not unlawful. Up until 1953, I think it was, heroin was not unlawful in this countryâ€”a drug which was widely used in childbirth; a drug which has an enormous number of human factors to it. For example, we deny terminally ill cancer patients access to one of the best analgesics known in the world. We are saying in Australia, `So what? Put up with the pain,' because some people use it unlawfully. I cannot wear that argument. I find that a nonsense argument.

         With the experience I have had and the years I have spent on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have come to the conclusion that we are talking about a social health problem.

         We should not forget in this House that the biggest drug problem in Australia is the abuse of prescribed drugs. There are more people addicted to tryptanol, serepax, valium, rohypnols and mogodons. More people present themselves to casualty centres in Australian hospitals because of poly-drug abuse of the legal drugs than because of illegal drugs. We treat those people as a health problem, quite properly; yet if you happen to use cocaine or heroin you are a criminal. The logic escapes me. It is a matter which we really have to talk seriously about in this country, because until we get to the stage of removing the demand we will never control supply.

         I can say to this House that my experience in looking at this problem around the world has been very simple. The Americans have spent billions of dollars. They have gone down to South America with the CIA, they have used aeroplanes and they have had operations of dubious legality in trying to stop the problem. They have failed. There is as much cocaine in the world today as there has ever been and the growth of the product is growing.

There is a new source of heroin coming into the United States, which is one of the problems we now see in Australia. There is an oversupply of heroin. Our young users of heroin are getting purer doses and overdosing and they are dying. That is our fault. We should all take the blame for what is occurring in the street. The fact is that in South America heroin is now being grown, is coming into the market and is competing with the Asian and the Pakistani heroin growers, so the price is dropping.

         I heard about a horrible reality when I was in the United States. The San Francisco narcotics squad were telling me that they had a seizer of cocaine in San Francisco several years ago. They seized six tonnes of pure cocaineâ€”six tonnes! The mind boggles. They thought they had a great success, a major breakthrough. They had got six tonnes of pure cocaine. So they watched the street prices, which is the only way to measure the success in these areas, and the street price of cocaine did not vary; it did not blip. In other words, the supply of cocaine was greater than the six tonnes they got.

         That brings me to the issues about corruption that the member for Melbourne raised. He said that one of his concerns was that if you have controlled operations there is the potential for police corruption. He said that that could allow police to siphon off part of the shipment and it could allow police to use a controlled operation to be importers of illegal drugs in their own right. They can do that now. This legislation will not make that any easier or any more difficult than it is now for any corrupt police officer in this country to do. You can get a corrupt Customs person and a corrupt cop and you can do it now.

That is where the corruption comes from, not because of this sort of legislation. As long as people can do that, there is going to be corruption. We ought to admit that and understand that that is the problem we face with corruptionâ€”the sheer profit, the sheer greed of the people who are involved in this trade.

         â€”in replyâ€”I thank honourable members for their contributions in the debate on the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. There are a number of points which have been raised, and I should respond to a number of those. Firstly, there is the question of retrospectivity. I am happy that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has put that in a proper context. The bill does not impose any retrospective criminal liability. The rationale for the principle that laws should not be retrospective is that a citizen should be entitled to rely on the law as it stands so that they can conduct their affairs accordingly.

         On that basis there is nothing repugnant about this bill, unless it is supposed that narcotics traffickers were entitled to assume that they could import narcotics without being prosecuted. The transitional provisions have been drafted as narrowly as possible without jeopardising the 10 outstanding prosecutions which rely on evidence obtained as a result of an importation which would otherwise not be able to be established on the Ridgeway principles. The transitional provisions apply to only future cases. Cases in which a court has already decided to exclude evidence are not affected. Without the transitional provisions, the evidence available to prosecute a number of pending cases relating to allegations of serious narcotics trafficking offences will be in serious jeopardy.

         I also should discuss briefly the issue of judicial authorisation. There has been some discussion regarding the view that operations should be authorised by the court. This bill has been structured, in my view, to appropriately balance broad questions about law enforcement, accountability, preventing abusive powers by police and maintaining the rule of law.

         When it comes to the decision in a specific case regarding an authorisation of a police operation, that is a quite different matter than the issuing of a search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrant. In those latter cases, an individual's liberties are being balanced against the interests of the community as a whole. Their house is being searched, their liberty restricted or their conversation recorded. In other words, there is a balancing operation.

         In the case of a controlled operation, there is no civil liberty to import narcotics free of police involvement. The decision whether to authorise an operation rests on an assessment of the likely effectiveness and security of the operation and a judgment about whether or not that person would be likely to have pursued that course irrespective of the operation.

         These are essentially operational questions and require judgments addressing the whole issue of what resources are available to law enforcement and the capacity of that operation to protect the community as a whole from any diversion. All those issues are ones which are simply not appropriate to pass from the person who has the correct responsibility of making a judgment to a court official.

         I think it is very important to have a system in which responsibility rests with the person who takes a decision. When it comes to whether or not a particular police operation is to be commenced, the decision is one in which we would expect the blame for any failure to be attached to that person responsible for taking the decision. It is hardly appropriate to place such law enforcement possibilities into the hands of courts, which are essentially charged with an adjudicative function rather than a function of operating as part of the executive.

         For that reason and the issue of the separation of powers, there are real constitutional reasons why operations should not be authorised by judges and magistrates. Courts have made it clear that it is contrary to the separation of powers and hence constitutionally invalid for judges and magistrates to perform administrative functions. Already in the Grollo and Bates litigation the Commonwealth's reliance on Victorian provisions that required a magistrate's authorisation to extend a period of a suspect's detention have been held invalid.

         So far the Commonwealth has managed to steer around these constitutional problems. We have done that by conferring on persons, as persona designata, powers of this administrative nature on persons who also hold judicial office. But the powers in this bill, were they to be conferred on a court, would move very substantially further from traditional notions of judicial function than any previously conferred on judges. It is quite possible that they would cross the line, delimiting the kinds of functions that judges might validly exercise.

         I make one final point on this issue. There has been a tendency in Australian law enforcement to load functions onto judges and magistrates. Judges and magistrates in both state and federal courts have bitterly complained about the workload that this has created and that they are becoming law enforcement adjudicators instead of judicial officers. At best there would be lengthy delays in securing the agreement from states and territories to allow their judges to perform these functions. In the interim, federal judges would face a significant workload in this area if it is appropriate as a matter of principle to confer that responsibility on the court. I simply do not believe that that is a desirable outcome.

         As to decision making criteria, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has suggested two additional decision making criteria. The first is that an operation should be a last resort where other methods of investigation are not open. The second is that the seriousness of the offence should be taken into account. The first point is already covered by the bill. Proposed section 15M will require that the authorising officer be satisfied that the operation will `make it much easier to obtain evidence' leading to the prosecution of a Commonwealth narcotics offence. In other words, where other methods of obtaining evidence are reasonably available the legislation will not facilitate a controlled operation to be authorised.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As to the suggestion that the seriousness of the offence be taken into account, an operation can be performed only to obtain evidence of a narcotics trafficking offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901, or aiding and abetting, attempting, inciting or conspiring to commit such an offence. In a rare case where the trafficking concerns a very small quantity of narcotic goods, it is hard to see what incentive there would be for law enforcement officers to devote to a minor instance substantial resources that would be required. That is particularly true given that senior officers whose authorisation is required are also responsible for making the most of the law enforcement budget.

         Might I say too in respect of the argument that safeguards have not been adequately built into this legislation, I think it is instructive to contrast this legislation with that passed by the South Australian parliament and introduced by the South Australian Liberal government. Any person who suggests that this bill is not hedged with an appropriate regard to the matters that are appropriate by way of safeguards needs only look to the South Australian legislation to see a manner of addressing the Ridgeway decision, which builds in remarkably fewer safeguardsâ€”indeed, none of those which have been counselled by members in this debate.

         Might I just mention a couple of other points. The issue of risk for arrest by state police has been raised. I would say to the member for Tangney that we are seeking to continue the close coordination between state and federal agencies in a wide range of matters. Controlled operations have existed a number of times under the administrative arrangements which were thought to authorise them adequately in the past. Cooperation between state and federal agencies will be necessary, as again they have always been. I would add, however, that the bill will make one significant difference: in an instance where an authorisation has been granted under this scheme there will be a clear and available certificate which will demonstrate on officer's bona fides in the unlikely event that an officer is arrested in some other jurisdiction.

         Turning to the issue of the committee: I do accept that it is inevitable that this matter will go before a parliamentary committee. I believe, however, that it is in the interests of this parliament that we move it through this process quickly and now. The government has given this bill category T status, which means the most urgent status which legislation can be given in the parliament, in view of the significance of the issue and the importance of it being passed by the House and the Senate as rapidly as possible.

         I am aware of substantial interest in this legislation in the Senate. I understand that interest is not confined to the coalition parties and is also an interest which is held by the Australian Democrats and other members of that chamber. In that circumstance, it seems to me not improbable that whatever course was adopted in this case the Senate might revisit the issues. It seems to me, given the need for this matter to be dealt with as a matter of genuine urgency, it is wise to accept the reality that the matter will be addressed in the Senate and proceed in that way.

A similar process has happened in the past where I have indicated to the member for Berowra that, where legislation is timed urgent, I would normally seek an assurance that there will be an undertaking across the Senate that the matter would not be revisited. Whilst that may be the case of the coalition parties, I have certainly not had it in a general sense that would extend to an undertaking that the Senate would not revisit it in those circumstances. Whilst I will not decline leave for the member for Berowra to move the motion that he proposes, we will be voting against it.

        I will not detain the House by reiterating my arguments again, save to say that I have not been persuaded. I encourage the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to read the thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) on his side in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill because it raised some additional matters that I had not covered. I thought it demonstrated the nature of the submissions that might well be received on this legislation. I accept that there may be a basis for argument on some of the issues that I pressed, even though you did not persuade me. I was particularly interested in the honourable member for Melbourne's comments because they were not picked up in your comments by your advisers. They put a new dimension on it and showed the way in which members of this House can contribute.

         While I am not in a position to say that the Senate would not revisit the matter, I can certainly say that, so far as my colleagues are concerned, our view was that an inquiry by a committee of this chamber of the parliament would suffice. I recognise that there may well have been views by others in other parties over whom we have no influence, but it would certainly give great credit, particularly to the House of Representatives, if the government was prepared to acknowledge that good work can be done in this chamber.

         My colleague the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone), who is in the other place, indicated that, even though we appreciate the urgency that the government attaches to the Senate, the Senate committee does have a very heavy workload. It was more likely that a prompt consideration would be possible in this place. While we would not be seeking to impose any capricious delay in the Senate, the workload it has is more likely to lead to a delay that the government says it does not want than if we were to proceed with the matter before this House's committee.

         â€”I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Firstly, I do accept that this House and its committees can play a very valuable role. I think the legislation that I as minister referred to the committee is the first instance in the history of this parliament under the new standing committee arrangements where that did occur, and I think it can work very well. I simply reiterate that where a time limited matter of some urgency is before the parliament and where there can be no assurances that the Democrats will not raise this issue and where there is an arrangement known to the government where either the Democrats or the coalition parties seek to have a reference to a Senate committee, that will be supported by the other parties unless we do have an assurance that we will not be duplicating a hearing process, both in the committee of the House and in the Senate. Obviously then the risk of great delay is inherent, as the honourable member for Berowra concedes must be a real factor in this instance.

         â€”All public opinion polls on issues of public moment indicate very clearly that law and order is an issue of very high priority with the general public. More and more people are becoming victims of crime, in particular of break and enter offences. Only those who have experienced this can know the anguish it causes. In the case of my own electorate, which has a large number of elderly people, I have heard stories where the consequence of break and enter of an elderly person's home has been nervous breakdown, subsequent admission to a nursing home and, effectively, the end of that person's life.

         Homes have become fortresses, and it is insurance company requirements that have partly caused this. It is very common for insurance companies to require that all doors have deadlocks, that all windows have security screens, as well as other similar requirements before they will renew insurance policies on homes. The fact that these may enhance a building's safety from break and enter but reduce personal safety from fire is something that nobody seems to be prepared to come to terms with.

         More recently, there has been a growing fear in the community on the subject of home invasion. In Queensland, within the last few days, we have all learned of a horrendous crime where a man of 59 was attacked in his own homeâ€”it appears by two peopleâ€”and stabbed to death. A few weeks ago an elderly lady in a nursing home was murdered for the contents of her purseâ€”the princely sum of $20. Whilst these home invasions may be relatively few in number, the great fear that they are invoking in the community is very real.

         In my experience, without a doubt, the greatest deterrent to crime is the fear of being caught. These days there is plenty being said in the newspapers and on the airwaves on the subject of the leniency of the legal and sentencing system. I appreciate that that is not a responsibility of the Commonwealth government. However, I have been dismayed to learn that the Commonwealth government denies cooperation to state law enforcement agencies and is effectively assisting perpetrators of crime. Specifically, suspected offenders for whom an arrest warrant has been issued are sheltered by the Commonwealth government from detection and apprehension.

         I have been told by police officers that warrants for arrest have been issuedâ€”for example, in the state of Queenslandâ€”for people who are suspected of multiple offences. These people skip off interstate. It is suspected that they are receiving social welfare. But the Department of Social Security, by not providing the information as to where these people may be living, absolutely denies cooperation to police forces. The police may suspect that offenders are living in a particular state. They may be able to say to the Department of Social Security that they have good reason to believe that these offenders are receiving social welfare benefits and are in a particular state, but the department refuses to give the police addresses for the service of arrest warrants.

         I find this absolutely incomprehensible, and I think the average honest citizen would do likewise. Surely it must be the ultimate offence to honest, hardworking members of the community who have been victims of crimeâ€”who, for example, have had savings stolen or who have had stolen from them goods they have worked hard to pay forâ€”to have to pay taxes which provide social welfare benefits for the very people who committed those crimes against them.

         I urge the government to look at this issue with a high degree of priority. All too often the Commonwealth government says that law and order is an issue that it is not properly involved inâ€”or, if they are involved, only at the fringe. Surely this issue goes to the heart of the possibility of apprehending, and therefore stopping, criminals. One can surely imagine the lark for these people who must think the rest of the community are fools: not only are these criminals being sheltered behind provisions of an act which were meant to protect innocent people, but they can go on robbing their victims by claiming social welfare, secure in the knowledge that the police force in the state in which they have committed their crimes simply cannot reach them.

         â€”I rise to speak on the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis on Badu Island, in the Torres Strait in my electorate. In April this year, the first reported cases of illness from Japanese encephalitis were identified on Badu. Three members of the community of Badu presented with this disease. Tragically, two of these people, one a young boy, later passed away as a result of this infection. I extend my condolences to the community and particularly to the families of these people.

         The virus has been isolated from the mosquito Culex annularostris, the common mosquito for this region. The preferred breeding habitat for this mosquito is ponded stagnant water with high organic contentâ€”for example, decaying vegetation or animal or human faeces. A study of the island revealed prolific breeding sites for these mosquitoes, particularly along the esplanade and the foreshore.

         Of a control group of approximately 200 people tested on the island, about 35 were identified as having been infected with the virusâ€”although only three presented with symptoms. There are about 800 people living on Badu, so as much as a quarter of the population may already have been infected. However, Badu Island is not the only place the disease has been identified in the Torres Strait. All northern islandsâ€”Boigu, Dauan and Saibaiâ€”have had infection in both people and animals. People have been infected in Badu, Mabuiag and Moa, and the disease has been identified in animals on Yorke, Stephen and Darley islands.

         There are a number of environmental health determinants that should not be understated in the spread of this disease. Badu Island and the other Torres Strait islands have a unique environmental, social, cultural and economic structure that is found nowhere else in the world where this disease has been identified. Of particular concern is the concentration of vectorsâ€”that is, mosquitoesâ€”amplifiersâ€”that is, stagnant waterâ€”and housing and people in small areas confined by beaches and hills. That is exactly the Torres Strait terrain.

         The Badu Island community is built over soils with a high water table. There are indications that this water table is between seven centimetres and 70 centimetres beneath the surface. This is a serious concern for two reasons. Firstly, water ponding within swampy surface areas and within existing defective drains gives rise to numerous breeding sites for mosquitoes. Secondly, this high water table increases the opportunity for surface pollution from household septic tanks and subsequent breeding sites from surface ponding of nutrient-rich water.

         â€”On 31 March 1995 I wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) concerning allegations in a report, `The hidden cost of fashion', that the use of exploitative outwork was rife in the fashion industry in Australia. The report, commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations, cited a figure of 300,000 outworkers and painted a picture of Dickensian dimensions. Accordingly, I asked the minister to:

       </para>

        It came as no surprise when the minister responded with claims that his data implied that there were around only 30,000 persons employed in outwork and that he did not consider that an independent inquiry would help in dealing with what he described as a complex matter.

         If it is such a complex matter, why is the state member for Pascoe Valeâ€”five months after I wrote to the minister and raised the issue in the parliamentâ€”running around the place claiming that TCF outworkers are being exploited, essentially because of the abolition of state awards? I know that the member for Melbourne would not believe that. The reasons are obvious. The facts are that right-wing Labor apologists such as `Toady' Thomson are too scared to point the finger at the federal government and demand an industry policy designed to help the unemployed in the old heartlands with real employment.

         To claim that exploitative outwork is the product of the abolition of state awards when neither the union nor the minister for industry believes it to be the case is fraudulent. Even Joan Kirner, despite the fact that she was Premier at the time, had enough courage to tell the Keating government that its tariff policies were opening the way for an increase in TCF imports and a decline in employment in that sector.

         Funnily enough, the member for Pascoe Vale is the same bloke who, prior to the Wills by-election, was saying privately, as he chewed on my ear, that tariff cuts were a big issue locally and the reason why TCF workers were being retrenched in their droves. It shows what an opportunist the member for Pascoe Vale is and how little he cares for the working people of the northern suburbs. He knows that the real reason why TCF workers are being exploited is that their jobs are diminishing and that the government has failed to provide alternative employment for those who have lost their jobs.

         The facts are that, although TCF exports have increased, imports have increased to record levels and factory based employment has decreased while outwork has increased. If the member for Pascoe Vale is going to be nothing more than an obsequious apologist for free market policies and the excesses of free trade, he has no right to represent working people. I hear the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) saying, `Hear, hear.' Furthermore, if he is so concerned about outwork, why is he not taking up the issue with the federal minister and telling him that his figures of 30,000 are wrong? If the jobs in the TCF are not going to come back, apologists like the member for Pascoe Vale and the right-wingers ought to stop deceiving working people and demand federal policies designed to give people secure work.

I agree with the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) that Jeff Kennett is terrible and shocking and is doing great harm to Victoriaâ€”his Tower of Babel on the Yarra is an absolute disgraceâ€”but, dear me, the federal Labor Party has to take some responsibility for unemployment in the TCF sector and take some serious responsibility for putting those people back into serious work.

         â€”I wish to raise what I consider to be a very dubious use of public money. It involves funds contributed by the Commonwealth government which appear to have been partly used for political purposes by the National Association of Forest Industries. The funds consist of a grant from the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation of $25,000 to NAFI for research on `public perceptions of independent certification', which involves labelling timber with respect to environmental sustainability criteria. With NAFI to provide $23,000, the overall project costs roughly $48,000.

         The objectives of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation are to invest in research which may develop or enhance sustainability, stimulate value adding, enhance market opportunities, improve technology and promote best practice, et cetera. They are all perfectly reasonable. It is funded by an industry levy and $1 from the Commonwealth for every $2 raised from that levy.

         The corporation funds projects on a joint venture basis, usually providing 30 to 60 per cent of the total cost. This project is entitled `independent certification' and is described thus in the corporation's annual operational plan:

       <para>
        In fact, thus far, the project has consisted of one major opinion poll on attitudes to forest issues. I have a copy of a report on the outcomes of this poll which was presented to the NAFI board on 16 May. Most of the questions which it refers to are purely broad political questions designed to elicit information to assist NAFI in campaigning against the environment movement. I will give some examples.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Some 83 per cent of those questioned said that the government should come out publicly with a balanced forest policy and implement this policy. Some 67 per cent responded that the government should set up an independent inquiry into forest issues headed by a prominent Australian. Some 52 per cent said that most forest management in Australia is better than what happens in other countries. Some 52 per cent said that the Commonwealth government should take over the prime responsibility for forest conservation management.

         Some 36 per cent saidâ€”no doubt this is even more alarming for NAFIâ€”that environmental groups should be given the responsibility of managing Australia's forests.

         The definition of `research and development' in the act allows funding to be spent on activity that is incidental to the primary focus. It includes things such as marketing and marketing analysis. However, the detailed project application of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation specifies that the project must be of net benefit through cost savings or general economic benefits, through the provision of new export markets or environmental improvements, or through a reduction in land degradation. That is something which I do not think the opinion polling to which I have referred really has much connection with.

         The connection is very tenuous at best. Even if the opinion polling was only about the specific purchasing of timber products that are labelled in a particular wayâ€”which it was notâ€”the connection is obviously a little bit remote from the primary purpose of the corporation. One could well ask why it did not deal with the real issues associated with certification, such as ISO 14,000, the Montreal process and the Forest Stewardship Councilâ€”all of which are very worthwhile initiatives relating to the question of timber from sustainable sources.

         Even though a minority of Commonwealth funds are involved in the projectâ€”roughly about $8,000â€”and clearly some of the questions do have some tenuous connection with the charter of the research and development corporation, it seems clear to me that the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation funding has in effect been used to bolster political opinion polling by NAFI. Given that NAFI is represented on the board of the corporation which makes the decisions and which approves the funding, this in my view is a very dangerous commingling of public and private moneys and may constitute a possible misuse of government money.

I call on the minister to ensure that this situation is properly investigated and that these things do not occur again in the future.

As you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Cystic Fibrosis Association has been endeavouring to persuade the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the government and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to include on the available health care pharmaceutical benefits list a drug that is having a dramatic and beneficial effect in respect of the treatment of this disease.

         The drug is known as pulmozyme. If you have any knowledge of cystic fibrosis, you will know that the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis is 30 years of age. Children with the disease spend an enormous amount of time in hospital. They develop pulmonary infections and pneumonia. This is very disruptive to their education and their lifestyles. I am not an expert, but I am told by families with children who have used the drug that the effect on their lifestyle is dramatic. The children are able to stay out of hospital and enjoy life.

The sufferers of cystic fibrosis have been endeavouring to have this drug considered and approved by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for a long time.

I am quite sure that the cost of $1,300 a month would not be begrudged by Australian taxpayers. I have spoken to a lot of people about this. I am sure there is an enormous amount of support on both sides of the House.

        For your information, the floor area of a property defined as vacant consists of all parts of the Net Lettable Area not currently exclusively leased to a specific tenant. The rental per square metre is an average derived by dividing total building income by the total occupied area. Total building income includes rent received for office and storage space, some common areas, car parking and signage rights, but excludes payments received from tenants for outgoings.

        You will note that there are no capital valuations for the Terrica Place and Kununurra offices. These buildings have only recently been completed and valuations are under way. Furthermore, in a number of single-tenanted buildings the average rent has not been provided where the tenant considered that the disclosure of that information might have an adverse effect on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth.

        That reason for withholding of information is fully in accordance with the "Guidelines on the Disclosure of Commercially Sensitive Property Information" which I have recommended to all departments and agencies. The Guidelines are based on the principle that details of rents paid by Commonwealth agencies and information on capital valuations of specific Commonwealth-owned properties should be withheld as commercial-in-confidence where disclosure might have an adverse effect on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth. They identify particular circumstances where that principle may apply.

        The details are provided in an aggregated format at building level because of the commercial-in-confidence nature of the property data. Where a building is occupied by a single Commonwealth business unit, the rental rate is withheld in accordance with the Guidelines referred to in my answer to Part 1 of the question. The particular circumstance applicable in these cases is that where disclosure of rentals paid by Commonwealth businesses would allow competitors to draw conclusions about cost structures, thereby placing the Commonwealth at a commercial disadvantage.

        (8) No, residual harvesting is not a term normally used to describe State and Territory harvesting operations. The production of pulpwood is a by product of operations intended to produce sawlogs. The amount of pulpwood that is generated varies depending on the type of harvesting undertaken and the proportion of sawlogs to pulplogs in forests to be harvested. There is no single term which describes all the harvesting methods by which chips may be derived.

        Roundwood will be used for the production of woodchips when production of sawn timber of a saleable quality is not technically and economically feasible. A proportion of trees harvested will contain faults or other characteristics which render them unsuitable for use as sawn timber. That proportion is likely to be higher in forests that have previously been selectively logged, or where there has not been active management to increase the proportion of saw logs produced.

        (1) No. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus has been allocated Commonwealth funding for 1995 by the Australia Council for its performing activity and by the Department of Employment, Education and Training for its training activity. In addition, my Department has provided a one-off grant of $30 000 to the Circus in 1994/95 to enable an independent review of the Circus to be undertaken. This review will include an analysis of all funding options available to the Circus, including private sector options, and will result in a report to the company and the Commonwealth by September on an appropriate long term financing structure for the company.

        The situations in which a party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no provision for withdrawal are set out in Section 3 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (Australian Treaty Series, 1974 number 2).

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        A party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no specific withdrawal provision where it is established either that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal, or where a right of denunciation may be implied by the nature of the treaty. A party withdrawing from such a treaty is required to give at least twelve months' notice of its intention to withdraw from the treaty. This procedure covers so-called unilateral withdrawal from a treaty. The Convention also provides for withdrawal where all the treaty parties have been consulted and consent.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties also deals with certain exceptional cases in which a party may claim that it is not bound by the treaty. Those cases relate principally to situations where there was a defect in the party's consent to be bound, or where the party alleges the treaty is invalid. In such cases, the Convention requires the party wishing to withdraw to notify the other parties of its claim to the right of withdrawal. If no objection to the claim is raised within three months, the party may withdraw from the treaty in question by communicating an instrument indicating its intention to the other parties. If another party does object, the parties are required to seek a solution to the issue in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

        (b) The Authority is aware of one occasion only on which changes to operating procedures were placed under the hotel doors of Ansett crew members. This occurred in September 1994 during the ground conversion training of Ansett pilots by Qantas. Personnel attending the course were accommodated at the Sheraton Sydney Airport hotel. Ansett developed new operating procedures related to push-back, starting and taxiing of aircraft and associated checklists. Ansett intended to hand the new procedures to the trainees for their use at the next session of training. As some trainees were not available to receive the procedures, the documents were placed under their hotel doors.

        (7) Yes, there was some initial concern within the CAA that insufficient time had been allocated by Ansett Australia for flight crew training prior to their planned commencement of operations on 4 September 1994. Flight crew ground conversion training commenced on 20 June 1994 allowing only 2.5 months to complete this training. However, the concern was allayed when Ansett announced its decision to use former Qantas and Air New Zealand Boeing 747 captains under contract to conduct the line training of Ansett crew and to act as training captains on flights for the first few months of line operations.

        Estimates of capital productivity are not prepared by industry type because it is necessary to have constant price input-output tables, which the ABS does not compile. Accordingly, multifactor productivity estimates (which measure the combination of capital and labour productivity) are prepared only at the aggregate level for the market and non-farm market sectors.

The honourable member may be interested to know that following the Government's acceptance of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA), approval for the establishment of the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 (ASM 1945-75) was received from the Queen on 22 February 1995.

        In relation to the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh, attention is drawn to the joint statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself on 10 May 1995. The joint statement provided that entering into an international treaty is not a reason for raising any expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been incorporated into Australian law. The High Court in the Teoh case made it quite clear that any legitimate expectation arising out of Australia becoming a Party to a treaty could only arise if there had been no executive or legislative indications to the contrary. The joint statement of 10 May constitutes such an executive indication and since that date no treaty to which Australia is a party should give rise to a legitimate expectation for the administrative law purposes identified in Teoh's case.

        (1) (a) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) produces official unemployment statistics using definitions of labour force status, which conform to international standards. Classification of a person's labour force status depends on responses to the ABS labour force survey rather than whether an individual is in receipt of income support. Consequently, it is not possible to accurately predict how any individual who is receiving the Partner Allowance will be counted in the labour force statistics.

        The new Partner Allowance is designed to assist spouses of Social Security Allowees who are aged 40 years or over as at 1 July 1995 and have little or no recent work experience. Recent work experience refers to employment for at least 20 hours per week for a total of 13 weeks or more in the previous 12 months, or 20 hours per week during the week prior to the claim. (Clients who are receiving the existing Partner Allowance prior to 1 July 1995 will not be required to meet the test of no recent work experience).

        It could be expected that most people who are eligible for the Partner Allowance will be neither working nor looking for work, and hence would be classified by the ABS as not in the labour force. It is possible, however, that some recipients of the Allowance may be employed part-time or unemployed and looking for part-time work. These persons would most likely be currently classified as employed part-time or unemployed and looking for work. Introduction of the new Partner Allowance could be expected, therefore, to have little impact on the ABS labour force statistics.

        Partner Allowance is identified as a discrete payment category in the Department's statistical publications. The number of partner allowance recipients is shown in the quarterly publication `Recipients  of Pensions, Benefits and Family Payments in Postcode Districts' and in the Department's yearly statistical overview publication. Partner Allowance is not included in the publication `Monthly Job Search and Newstart Allowance Statistics.'  It should be noted that recipients of Partner Allowance, introduced in September 1994, have never been included in JSA/NSA statistics. Partner Allowance is not an activity tested payment and, prior to its introduction, no activity test applied to the partners of unemployed people.

        (4) In accordance with its international obligations as a party to the Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs 1961, Australia is required to exercise certain controls over trade, cultivation and use of cannabis (or hemp). Whilst the Convention specifically exempts the growing of cannabis for industrial purposes from its control, parties to the Convention are obliged to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of, and illicit traffic in, the leaves of the cannabis plant.

        (3) As outlined above, matters relating to the production of hemp are a State responsibility. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth, as a general rule, is supportive of value adding activities and is funding, through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), research into the prospects for a viable hemp industry in Australia.

        The study will concentrate on the Australian context and will involve extensive consultation with other interested groups. In particular, it will explore how hemp will compete with, or complement, other traditional fibre sources. It will also be looking closely, in a commercial sense, at whether returns are likely to cover the substantial costs of establishing facilities to extract and process the new fibre.

        The RIRDC study will complement research being carried out in the States. Until recently, licences to cultivate hemp had only been issued in Tasmania where two crops totalling around 2 hectares per year have been grown on a trial basis. The University of Tasmania is responsible for the majority of production with the Tasmanian Hemp Company also involved. These licences include a stipulation that, inter alia, plantings would be used to test viability for production for fibre for both paper and clothing manufacture.

        (1) Implementation of China's one-child policy at the local level can result in coercive practices which the Australian Government does not in any way condone. Such coercive practices are however, on the whole, rogue applications of the one-child policy by over-zealous officials at the local level. Through provincial regulations, fines are commonly applied as a sanction to families with more than one-child. But application of the fines, and the one-child policy, is becoming more difficult as social controls in China ease.

        China's new Maternal and Infant Health Law which came into effect on 1 June 1995 includes provisions that couples with certain medical conditions may not marry unless they undertake long-term contraceptive measures or agree to sterilisation. In the case of certain prenatal diagnoses the physician may advise the parents to terminate the pregnancy. However, the law stipulates that any termination requires the signed consent of the person concerned. The need for consent is welcome although the way the law is implemented is clearly critical.

        At the 39th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (March/April 1995), Australia co-sponsored a resolution calling on the United Nations to ensure that its NGO accreditation process was transparent. Later, the General Assembly, with the support of Australia, passed a similar resolution. The United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is formally responsible for accrediting NGOs to the Conference. The ECOSOC is currently meeting to consider NGO accreditation. Australia will continue to pursue at ECOSOC its support for the right of all women to attend the conference. Once ECOSOC has made its decision, the Government will consider what further action, if any, would be appropriate.

        There have been four rounds of talks during this period. At these meetings Australia has expressed its concern about the lack of reciprocity of benefits and the limited social insurance coverage of Greek-Australians under the Greek social security system. Reciprocity is one of the fundamental principles on which our agreements are negotiated. The type of agreement that we are able to offer Greece depends on the extent to which these principles are met.

        When negotiations finally resumed in April 1995, the Greek side informed the Australian delegation for the first time that it had difficulty with a fundamental provision in the Australian draft agreement; that is, the draft agreement presented almost one full year before in May 1994. The provision in question concerns the rate of pensions Australia would pay to people who already live in Greece. It does not affect people who live in Australia or pensioners who have already returned to Greece with their Australian pensions, or who will return to Greece in future with their pensions. The Greek side was informed that the provision was fundamental and it agreed to re-examine its position.

        Australia already pays over 8,000 pensions into Greece at a cost of close to $60m a year. With an agreement along the lines preferred by the Greek side, this would increase by some $50m a year. At present, Greece pays very little pension into Australia (some 100 pensions). I do not believe that this figure will increase by much under an agreement because of the basic nature of the Greek pension system. This is borne out by information we have received from one of Greece's other agreement partners.

        (1) The Government is developing plans for a national repository for low and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste. The final repository design, including the nature of barriers used to isolate waste from the environment, will be influenced by the characteristics of the selected site.

        (1) The Occasional Paper entitled "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in the Australian Labour Market 1986 and 1991" was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in early June 1995. The figures in the report showed that, at the date of the 1991 census, indigenous Australians were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as other Australians and had a lower self-employment rate. The data also indicated that indigenous Australians were more likely to be working in unskilled occupations and that 44 per cent of those employed worked in Public Administration and Community Services compared with 23 per cent of other Australians.

        The report noted the fact that between 1971 and 1986 there was a four-fold increase in the proportion of indigenous people who were unemployed but also pointed to a reversal of this trend between 1986 and 1991. Between 1986 and 1991 the proportion of the indigenous population of working age recorded as employed rose from 31.3 per cent to 37.1 per cent while the proportion unemployed fell from 17.1 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The paper also noted the effects of the Community Development Employment Program (CDEP) and labour market programs in improving the employment to population ratio for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people between 1986 and 1991. (ABS Census data show an increase of over 16 per cent in the indigenous working age population over this period.)

        As well as priority access to regular labour market programs under which the majority of program assistance is provided indigenous people receive special assistance under TAPâ€”the Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Program. Extra mainstream program places have been provided under the Government's Working Nation strategy. The TAP budget for 1995-96 has also been increased significantly (from $44.8 million in 1994-95 to $50.4 million in 1995-96). In 1995-96 TAP will be funded from the main Labour Market Program appropriation, thereby increasing the funding flexibility and program options available to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients.

        Service levels in excess of Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) register share are being achieved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients under Working Nation. To the end of May 1995 4.5 per cent of job placements were for the client group, compared to their 3.7 per cent share of the CES register. Around 6 per cent of clients under case management and 5.4 per cent of case managed outcomes were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients, compared to a 4.2 per cent share of the register of long term unemployed clients. Some 5.4 per cent of all labour market program places were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the same period.

        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status is one of the characteristics used during the CES registration process to identify clients at risk of long term unemployment. Such clients are then assessed in more detail to determine the severity of their disadvantage and the need for case management and other forms of assistance. To assist indigenous people in remote areas with limited employment prospects, additional funding has been made available for CDEP places.

        Indigenous Australians are major beneficiaries of the Remote Area Field Service (RAFS) which provides employment and training services to remote area employers and unemployed jobseekers with limited or no access to a CES office. RAFS teams operate from 30 CES offices, mainly in northern and central Australia, providing employment and training assistance to an estimated 16,500 unemployed jobseekers, including 11,500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander jobseekers. The RAFS teams are cooperating with other Commonwealth agencies servicing remote communities to streamline servicing arrangements and to maximise the employment opportunities available to remote jobseekers through infrastructure projects. Through the use of Mobile Office Information Technology and satellite telephone and communications equipment, the RAFS teams are able to match the client service standards provided by CES offices.

        Working Nation also established 62 Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) to increase local community input to the delivery of programs and services to employers and jobseekers by the CES. Membership of ACCs is drawn principally from industry to enable ACCs to fulfil their role of generating employment initiatives, increasing the responsiveness of the CES to regional labour markets and linking Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) programs with regional development. A typical ACC comprises employers, unions, community and regional organisations, government representatives and major education and training providers and is chaired by an industry representative. Two ACC chairs are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and there are a total of 45 members of ACCs who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives.

        (1) The Australian Government has always maintained a policy of recognising eligible service by members of the Australian Defence Force and other entitled persons or groups by the awarding of an appropriate medal. Prior to 1975, this recognition was through the medium of the Imperial system of honours and awards. Since 1975, indigenous Australian awards have been available.

        (2) No. Since the end of World War II subsequent campaign awards under the Imperial System for service in South East Asia, including Vietnam, have been common to all three services, that is, service afloat, service ashore and service in the air. Entitlements are, therefore, determined by the environment in which members operate rather than the service to which they belong. This means that a RAAF pilot would become eligible under the same conditions as those for a Naval pilot and RAN clearance divers would be under the same qualifying conditions as other ground forces.

        (4) The Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA) recently conducted an extremely comprehensive review of awards for defence and defence related activities. The Government believes the Committee achieved a remarkable result considering the range of awards reviewed and particularly as recognition for some periods of service has been achieved after many years. For example, the changes in eligibility for the award of the World War II medals, the 1939-45 Star and the Africa Star have resulted in many Australians being granted these medals in time for Anzac Day 1995â€”some fifty years after the event. However, the Government appreciates that, even with such an extensive review, anomalies will and do occur. To ensure adequate review of such matters, the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Honours and Awards chaired by the Department of Administrative Services has, and will continue to review anomalous situations brought to its attention.

The Government considers that women who lose the support of a partner at a younger age will generally be more able to participate in the workforce and would benefit most from other measures designed to assist and encourage their workforce participation. For this reason, JSA/NSA remains a better option than widow allowance for these women because it provides access to a full range of labour market programs including the Job Compact. The Government is committed to encouraging and supporting women to participate in the paid workforce to best ensure their financial security.

Australia's relationship with Taiwan cannot be separated from the fact that Australia recognises the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. So while the Government encourages the development of our economic, trade and other interests with Taiwan, we do not have official contacts.

        It has been the policy of the Australian Government to agree to private visits to Australia by high level officials from Taiwan whose visits are directly related to the promotion of our strong and expanding economic and trade interests. However, a visit by Mr Lee, even if private, would be of a political nature, not consistent with the current state of our unofficial links with Taiwan.

        (4) The Government will help fund improvements to disability access for all Schools mentioned in Question 3, in time for the start of the 1996 school year. Other projects may have involved improving disability access, but as it is a standard provision of Commonwealth funding it is often not identified in larger project descriptions.

        (1) Disability support pension payments are paid directly to the pensioner's account unless the pensioner is paid under a group schedule arrangement or has elected to have their pension paid to a nominee. Group schedule arrangements operate where the management of a Business Service (formerly sheltered workshop) or nursing home receives a number of pension payments in respect of employees/residents and is responsible for distributing individual pension payments to the pensioners themselves. However, this arrangement is no longer offered to Business Services and customers currently paid by this method are being encouraged to convert to direct credit or nominate a person to receive their pension on their behalf.
