       That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Monday, 14 January 1991, of the Honourable Gordon Bryant, member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Wills from 1955 to 1980, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1972 to 1973 and Minister for the Capital Territory from 1973 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant was born on 3 August 1914 at Lismore, Victoria, and was educated at Frankston High School, Melbourne Teachers College and Melbourne University. Prior to entering Federal Parliament, he was a secondary school teacher with the Victorian Education Department. He served with the Australian Army 46th Infantry Battalion and the Melbourne University Regiment, Citizen Military Forces. In 1955 he was elected to Federal Parliament as the Australian Labor Party member for Wills and for 25 years, until 1980, gave faithful service to his electors and the nation as a member of the House of Representatives.
      </para>
      <para>
       In an era when the inner suburbs of Melbourne struggled to get a fair share of the nation's resources, he was at all times a hard-working representative of his electors, and I can assure you, Mr Speaker, as the local member, that he was a hard act to follow. He was also a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia for a total of 12 years and President of the Aborigines Advancement League of Victoria from 1957 to 1964.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant was appointed Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1972. In 1973 he took up his second ministerial appointment when he became Minister for the Capital Territory. He also served on several parliamentary committees with the focus on Aboriginal affairs and land rights issues. His concern over the issue of Aboriginal rights was evident not only during his parliamentary career but throughout his life. It was a subject he pursued with energy and conviction. He retired in 1980, but maintained contact with the Parliament through his work as Secretary of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon was a fighter-a fighter for the people of the electorate of Wills, a fighter for the people of his State and nation, a fighter for the Aboriginal members of the Australian community and a fighter for the Australian Labor Party. He was throughout his life active and independent minded, and he did not shirk a tough issue. He stood up for what he saw as right. On behalf of the Government, I extend our most sincere sympathy to his wife Pat and sons Robin and Linton.

        —On behalf of the Opposition, I wish to join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our deep regret at the death on 14 January of this year of Gordon Bryant. Being a relative newcomer to the Parliament, I did not know Gordon Bryant personally, but those of my colleagues who served with Gordon Bryant in this chamber speak highly of him and describe him as a man who was honourable in every sense of the word.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Sir William Aston, a previous Speaker in this House, recalls Gordon Bryant as an affable and gentle man who never bore grudges. This is in contrast to his spirited performance in the House as an aggressive debater who would put his case strongly and tenaciously when fighting on a point of principle.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant gave long and dedicated service to this Parliament, serving the electors of Wills for 25 years. I note from the Hansard of 22 February 1956 that in his maiden speech Gordon Bryant stated that it was his honour to represent the people of Wills, who had for the past 50 years consistently elected to the Parliament men who had kept the Labor Party on the straight and narrow. He then outlined how he envisaged his vision of individual gain being achieved through Labor's socialist philosophy and contrasted it with the support for private enterprise expressed by another new member also speaking for the first time on that day, Malcolm Fraser.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a backbencher for a long period of time, Gordon Bryant made a substantial contribution to the committee system, serving in total on 12 parliamentary and select committees. As a secondary school teacher prior to his entry to Parliament, he had an enduring interest in education, and throughout his time in Parliament pressed for a broader role for the Federal government in education. He also championed the cause of Aboriginal rights, he was a strong defender of civil liberties and he fought hard against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. His staunch defence of the seat of Wills through the late 1970s from the sorties of the then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is well documented.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant was one of a large group of Labor members who spent a very long time in opposition and who went into government in 1972 with all the pent up frustration of opposition and with enthusiasm for change. His long involvement with Aboriginal rights culminated in his appointment in the Whitlam Government as the first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. His deep concern to improve the condition of Aboriginal people and the difficulties he encountered in carrying through that task have been shared by successive Ministers on both sides of this House.
      </para>
      <para>
       Speaking to the Fabian Society in July 1973, Gordon Bryant expressed a vision for the future of the Aboriginal people which few could dispute, warning that there were limits to what could be achieved for Aborigines by direct intervention. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       We can provide money where lack of it has prevented worthwhile developments. We can increase the pace of housing construction, put more medical staff in the field and build, equip, and staff better schools in Aboriginal communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       We cannot, however, decide for the Aborigines what they want. And if we supply too often what we think they need, we may be wasting our resources and delaying their real progress. Aborigines must regain autonomy and a sense of control over their own lives and future.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nearly 18 years have passed in the interim and many billions of taxpayers' dollars spent, yet the sentiments that Gordon Bryant expressed are still relevant-tragically, maybe even more so than when that expression was made.
      </para>
      <para>
       A strong commitment to improve the well-being and opportunities of Aboriginal people is the motivation behind a more cooperative relationship between the Government and the Opposition. I am sure that Gordon, as a former Minister, would have welcomed this attempt by both sides to move away from politics and to concentrate on the well-being of the Aboriginal people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant has been described as a man of literature with a deep sense of history. I am told by my colleagues that Gordon was never lost for words, no matter what the occasion, and that his keen sense of humour was enjoyed by members on both sides of this place. In joining this condolence motion, I have acknowledged that I have relied on the record and on accounts from colleagues and contemporaries. However, I believe the tribute paid to Gordon Bryant by his friend and parliamentary colleague of 25 years, Les Johnson, the former member for Hughes, is the best summation. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon was a big man in every way, genial and gregarious, of friendly disposition and high principles, devoted to his family, community and country.
      </para>

        —I rise to speak to this condolence motion because Gordon Bryant lived in Lower Plenty in my electorate for many years. He and his wife Pat established their home on the banks of the Plenty River. What has been said and will be said today sums up much of Gordon's contribution to our community throughout his parliamentary life. However, I had the opportunity to know him and to work with him in the community in my electorate and I know about the service he performed outside the Parliament, particularly in his retirement.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As we know, he contributed most of his working life, after his wartime service, to the Parliament but he also continued to contribute actively to the community. Most people who knew him or knew of him well respected his commitment to our parliamentary process and system of government, but he firmly believed that our Constitution needed a major overhaul-and he was not the only one with that belief. Much of what he did in our community after his retirement from Parliament was in fact directed to discussing issues relating to our Constitution and our system of government with the ordinary citizen of our country. As Gordon would have it, one of the reasons that so little constitutional reform occurs in this country is that the problems of the Constitution are not discussed or understood as well as they should be by the Australian citizen.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon understood this. He wanted to mobilise understanding and discussion and he did this in a number of ways. He was a key founding member of the Yarra Valley University of the Third Age. Those many hundreds of people who have been actively involved in that organisation over the couple of years since its formation will certainly miss him very much, not only for his wisdom and guidance in the development of the organisation, but also for his commitment to the programs of that organisation-particularly, as I said before, to issues of government and the Constitution. This organisation was really much of what Gordon Bryant was about-it is an organisation which enables people, particularly retired and elderly people, to share their lifelong skills, experiences and interests with others and to demonstrate unequivocally that retirement, old age or frailty should not limit one's ability to learn new skills, transfer old ones, discuss issues and continue to contribute to the community. The Yarra Valley University of the Third Age was part of his commitment to the principle that `you are only as old as you feel' and to his understanding and concern that older people have an underestimated, underutilised role and status in Australian society. To his last days, as well as he was able, he continued to stress that point and do something about it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many words have been said about his commitment to eduction, and people can understand that commitment. In fact, his commitment went beyond that of a teacher; it continued through his parliamentary life and, indeed, through his life after parliament. His commitment to universal and continuing education for all people, particularly Aboriginal people, also meant that he worked tirelessly for the La Trobe University; again, contributing to the development of education and life opportunity for the people of the northern suburbs of Melbourne-the people whom he served as a member of parliament and, indeed, as a citizen.
      </para>
      <para>
       He will be missed by many. His personality was such that when Gordon Bryant walked into the room in a very short time everyone knew that he was there. They knew that because he was a person who made friends easily, accepted people easily and, basically, was prepared to talk, laugh and deal with people as human beings. He will be missed by many, but his contribution to our community in so many ways-inside and outside parliament-will continue to benefit our society. On this occasion, I, along with many people in my electorate and the Labor Party in my electorate, extend support and sympathy to his wife, Pat, his family and all of those people who knew and cared so much for him.

        —On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I rise to support this condolence motion in respect of Gordon Munro Bryant. I also support the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others. Amongst all his contributions, Gordon Bryant participated in two parliamentary delegations to Asia, one in 1967 and the other in 1970. He was a genial man with an interest in that region, which I admired. Perhaps this flowed from his service in the armed forces-he rose to the rank of captain-that took him to Borneo and other parts of Asia.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I believe that too often, unfortunately, members on both sides of the House have not had either the opportunity or the resource to go to Asia in a detailed way. Gordon Bryant did so not once but twice. That example is one which we should all take note of because, clearly, we do need to build on our links with Asia in the broadest sense. With his work on those parliamentary delegations and with his other general work and activity, Gordon Bryant gave the Parliament an example of how to build up a relationship between Asia and Australia, which is so important for our economic future.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant certainly had a sense of humour. He struck me as someone slightly larger than life as I looked at him and met with him on a few occasions as a then member of the New South Wales State Parliament and more recently when I came to the Federal Parliament. I think it would have touched his sense of humour were he able to realise that he has now been accorded a very rare privilege in the annals of this Parliament: namely, that he will be remembered and honoured not on one occasion but, because of the special sitting of the Parliament in January, on no less than two occasions by appropriate periods of silence. That is a nice way to salute a nice person. I extend sympathy and condolences to the family of Gordon Munro Bryant.

        —I join in supporting this motion of condolence to Patricia and the family of Gordon Bryant. I do not want to repeat what has been said. But I think it is true to see Gordon Bryant as in many ways very representative of the Labor member of the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s-a period of opposition but also a period of deep values and commitments which were reflected in Gordon Bryant's time in this Parliament. No one was a more passionate advocate of public enterprise, as his first speech that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) referred to would evidence. He saw himself in contrast to the view of Malcolm Fraser but, nevertheless, as equally committed to the care of the individual.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant was a representative of this Parliament and had a great and enduring faith in the sovereignty of the Parliament. Perhaps that was why he, along with so many of his contemporaries, were so injured by the events of 1975. In terms of economic policy, he belonged to the days of a rather grand expansionary Keynesian policy. I can remember in opposition in the period in which we were both here on the economics committee that people tended to be regaled by very long speeches on Gordon's part in terms of how all things were possible. Of course, that is not the case. Certainly at that time people did believe in an economic policy that was Keynesian and expansionary and which tended to include rather than exclude various opportunities.
      </para>
      <para>
       He was, of course, passionately committed to social justice and was a very fine representative of the northern suburbs of Melbourne. No-one was more willing to represent that area at that time. No-one was more willing to move out of the established Anglo-Saxon areas to work with various migrant groups. The Italian community was always very close to Gordon Bryant and he was always very anxious to ensure that they played a stronger role in terms of politics in this country. His interest in education was lifelong, as was his interest in prison reform which, in respect of his Capital Territory portfolio, went beyond his time in Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       I guess that Gordon is remembered for his interest in Aboriginal affairs. I was thinking about the occasion on which Gordon entered the Ministry, having spent some time moving around the country getting to know various Aboriginal communities. Lionel Bowen was telling me that early on in the period of the Whitlam Government he had to deal with a bill for something like $20,000 for afternoon tea. Apparently when Gordon had been up in the Centre he had said to the various communities, `When we come to office we will have you all in to afternoon tea'. It was probably the largest afternoon tea ever celebrated, but also it was a very important time in regard to the principles of self-determination and giving some real power and influence to Aboriginal communities within this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I got to know Gordon as a candidate and then as a member of parliament back in 1977. I was first actively involved with him during the election campaign of 1977. One of our methods of campaigning at that time was to go to factories and address meetings outside. The theory of these meetings was that the workers would down tools when the member or candidate arrived and come out to the front of the factory. There would instantly be a mass meeting. Gordon would have the megaphone ready, he certainly had the rhetoric, and it was going to be a great occasion. I recall being somewhat nervous. I had not had a lot of experience with these kinds of campaign meetings. When Gordon said, `Oh, they will all be out', I was a bit doubtful. I thought there was a bit of a sense that we were not going all that well in 1977. But Gordon said, `No, don't worry, they will be out. But you don't wait till they come out; you get straight into it'.
      </para>
      <para>
       There we were out in Albert Street, Preston, with traffic going past and enormous noise. Gordon was talking about the only way to restore democracy and socialism to this country, and off he went. At about 12.30 the workers started coming out. I thought, `It's okay, it's okay; it's all going to work'. They went over the road to the pub. Gordon kept going. They came back again. Still Gordon kept going. He was a tremendous campaigner. He was, as has been said, a fighter. He was not someone to be put off by a situation such as that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I appreciate more than anything the warmth of his friendship for people in the Parliament and people on our side of politics. In many ways he represented a set of views that are not quite the views that one would put now. But he represented values which went to the absolute heart of the Labor Party. It is for those values and his commitment to those values, his achievements both in government and in opposition, that this Parliament and this country owe him a very great debt. I am very pleased to support the motion and to join in offering my best wishes to Patricia and to his family.

He put the long term interests of parliaments above the short term interests of executive governments and other interests, and in days when the parliamentary institution is under challenge from many quarters, it does us well to remember that there are people-and have been, and we hope will be-like Gordon Bryant, who espoused the parliamentary cause so vigorously. That is the principal reason I wish to support this motion with great sincerity.

        —Mr Speaker, my future wife and I came to know Gordon and Pat Bryant around 1951 when he first stood as the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate for Deakin. He stood in the same seat in 1954, in both cases narrowly losing to Frank Davis. Then in 1954-55 came a political revolution in the affairs of the Victorian branch of the ALP when the Federal Executive intervened to remove supporters of the industrial groups from control. This action was taken at the urging of Dr H. V. Evatt, the Federal leader.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Victorian party split, with the `Groupers' crossing the floor to defeat the State Labor Government of John Cain senior, then forming the Anti-Communist Labor Party, later the Democratic Labor Party, which, by directing its second preference votes, kept the Victorian ALP out of office for 27 years until John Cain junior won the 1982 State election. Of the 15 Labor members of parliament who had been returned in 1954, seven joined the anti-communist Labor Party, seven stayed with the ALP, and one, Don McLeod, did not contest Wannon in 1955, and of course Malcolm Fraser won the seat. Redistribution eliminated two ALP seats-Burke and Hoddle-and created one-Scullin.
      </para>
      <para>
       After the 1955 split Prime Minister Menzies called an early Federal election. Labor's Victorian seats fell from 15 to 10. Four new Labor candidates were selected by the central executive for safe ALP seats held where sitting MPs had defected-Bob Holt in Darebin, Hector McIvor in Gellibrand, Gordon Bryant in Wills, and Jim Cairns in Yarra. Gordon Bryant remained as member for Wills for 25 years and was the last serving of that group who came in after the split.

      <para>
       Many people of my vintage will recall Gordon for his patience and kindness and encouragement to young people. He was always available to speak to groups, to attend meetings, and to encourage people-particularly young people-to express themselves. He had a profound influence on former members such as Race Mathews, David McKenzie and Tony Lamb.

       I used to baby-sit his sons Robin and Linton when Gordon and Pat were out attending electorate functions, and it has to be said he was an extremely assiduous attender of functions. I think perhaps only the honourable member for Cook may have attended more functions one way or another than the Hon. Gordon Bryant.

       He was a well rounded character, both literally and metaphorically. He had been an army officer in World War II. He remained in the Citizen Military Forces until 1961, and was active in the Returned Services League of Australia. Nevertheless, he was completely unmilitary in style and thinking. This central but endearing contradiction was very evident at his funeral service, where the supporters of military power were lined up on one side of the church and the pacifists were on the other, and Gordon Bryant was the common link between them. He lost a lung in a military training accident in 1940, but it did not seem to inhibit his level of activity, nor did the fact that he was a diabetic for many years. Gordon was, if not a pacifist, then very close to it. He deplored violence of all kinds. He liked to be a reconciler. He would have agreed with William Blake that there is no such thing as an abstract good, that good must be done `in minute particulars'.

       He found the idea of cruelty, suffering, death, maiming, wounding, torture-all of those things-intolerable; whether it was the needless sacrifice and suffering of war, the chronic neglect of the Aborigines or the cruelty of torture and execution in penal systems throughout the world. He was very conscious of Pentridge Gaol being an important part of the Wills electorate and it was that, in part, that made him active in the Howard League for Penal Reform and in the Anti-Hanging Council in Victoria.
      </para>
      <para>
       In politics, despite the rhetoric that he often used in debate, he was essentially a conciliator, maintaining excellent personal relations with members of other parties. Within the ALP, although he was identified for a long time with the ruling group in the Victorian executive, he hated what he used to call `administrative violence' and he was always very concerned that dissenters such as me and from time to time the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) would be `donged'. He was always anxious to do what he could to make sure that the `dongings' did not take place. So I am very grateful to him for that.

       I wanted to conclude by saying something about Gordon's important role with the Parliamentary Library and in particular with the oral history work for the library. He was very anxious to push for work to be done by the library to mark Australia's bicentenary because he wanted to disseminate knowledge of the Federal Parliament. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. BROWN) that he was essentially a parliament man.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result of his encouragement and that of the late Senator John Knight and Brenda McAvoy of the Parliamentary Library, and with advice from a group of Canberra academics, the bicentenary publications project was brought into being and given the task of supervising a range of books about the Australian Parliament, and Gordon became a foundation member of the Bicentenary Publications Projects Advisory Board from 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       He advocated producing biographical material on Federal parliamentarians and then promoted the oral history project. He then took a very active role in the project, and participated as one of the three interviewers who met and assessed applicants for the position of interviewers. He conducted four interviews himself of former colleagues and gave his own interview, which amounted to 26 hours in length. Perhaps it was only part heard, but it is regarded as one of the best interviews in the project. He approached many former colleagues to encourage them to be recorded, and much of the success of the project was due to his participation and encouragement. The oral history project was another lasting memorial to the historical awareness, the unbounded enthusiasm and the imagination of Gordon Bryant. He was also a visiting fellow in political science at La Trobe University, where he was a lively and stimulating presence.
      </para>
      <para>
       I cannot resist mentioning that he had his own way of fighting back against a system which he thought was unjust. In those freewheeling days of the Whitlam Ministry, which many will recall, there were a lot of people who-it was alleged-were inclined to drink and smoke during Cabinet meetings. From my recollection of what things were like, this does not happen so much now. Members of the Cabinet had to contribute $40 per month. Gordon was a teetotaller, and he did not smoke either. He felt that this was an outrageous form of imposing a tax to encourage other people's vice.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the other hand, Gordon had no particular objection to eating, which is perhaps something that we share. Gordon's fight-back capacity was to order meat pies, which he would lavishly cover with Australia's national drink, and consume them. He felt that in this way he was getting back a share of his own contribution. He was even known to slip the odd pie out of Cabinet for afters in what used to be irreverently known as a `person-bag'.
      </para>
      <para>

        —It was my great privilege to know Gordon Bryant and to witness his performance as a Minister. From the comments of the honourable member who spoke before me, one would appreciate that Gordon would never be categorised as an economic rationalist, but he certainly made a very significant contribution in his two areas of ministerial responsibility. The time at which I particularly came to know him well was when the Fraser Government came to office and he became a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs which I chaired.

       I would say that I fitted that last category because one of the first references that the Committee had when I was its Chair related to the alcohol problems of Aboriginals. Along with Bill Wentworth, Les Johnson, Peter Drummond and Sam Calder, Gordon Bryant and I went to the Northern Territory for the purpose of undertaking that particular reference. As we travelled in the HS748 aircraft from here to the Northern Territory, we passed a town in South Australia called Leigh Creek. As we landed, Gordon pointed out that this town was lavished with many of the facilities that most of us take for granted in the centres in which we live-all the infrastructure which is so important to our lifestyles. He said, `Look at the swimming pools, the city halls, the roads and the telephones'. He pointed them all out to me and then he said, `When we get to Bathurst Island and you see a community of much the same size, have a look at it and see whether much the same infrastructure is in place for those people who are living in much the same sort of an environment and you will have some better appreciation of the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people and why something should be done about it'. That was a lesson for me and it is one that I am glad to be able to recall and share today.

        —I want first to sympathise with Gordon's family. I knew Gordon Bryant for a long time and served with him here for some 13 years. Gordon was a person who believed that the establishment, particularly the Treasury, was there to prevent things being done and to protect the establishment. He practised that in every way that he possibly could. When the phone rang and Gordon was on the end of it, his first remark would be, `Comrade, what have you done for democracy today?'. He was an effervescent character and he was always doing things.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant represented people more than most and rarely made excuses for why things could not be done. He had a reputation for administration which was not enviable and also not altogether fair. The Whitlam Government came to office after a long period in opposition and, in an effort to correct what had been up until then an area of gross neglect, more funds were allocated to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio than the processes of government through the Public Service methods could handle. Gordon short-circuited that process to his own personal disadvantage at a later time when he was told by committees of this Parliament and the Auditor-General that he had used methods which were inappropriate. It never worried Gordon. What did worry Gordon was that he was denied the opportunity to defend himself, even though subsequently he was proven right.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his electorate Gordon believed in educating people about the political processes and because he did not see any real future in the Melbourne Herald-Sun group as anything other than protectors of the establishment he was very active in running the Coburg Citizen. He was a pamphleteer-one of the last, I suppose, in the political process in Australia; we have now gone to letters. He was dedicated to that process and put in many, many hours of work. As has already been said, he would talk to everyone he could talk to. If he entered a room, he certainly was known very quickly because he made it known who he was, what he was and then asked for people's opinions. I am not sure whether he listened to them but he certainly told them his.
      </para>
      <para>
       On one occasion just after I came to the Parliament, he attended an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. He had made friends with a number of the delegates, including some from Mongolia and Afghanistan, and had promised to visit both of those countries. He did so on his way home. In the late 1960s he drove a car from England, through the Continent to Japan. He was met by an honour guard in Afghanistan. Although he was two days late, the colonel with the guard was still there to meet him. He eventually went by ferry from Japan to Ulan Bator to visit the Mongolians. I was at a conference some time later when delegates from Mongolia asked after Gordon Bryant.
      </para>
      <para>
       He did make an impression. But I suppose one of the things that one can say about Gordon Bryant is that he never stopped trying during his whole life for those people he believed he represented and the causes that he supported. He was a debater in this Parliament, not a contributor. I can recall the first session at which Norm Foster and Al Grassby were in this place. They were both noted contributors who spoke on every possible occasion. I think Al Grassby had spoken 39 times in the autumn session of the first Parliament of which he was a member. Gordon Bryant had contributed more. He knew every way that there was of raising a matter in the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       On another occasion, he nearly got a couple of then conservative Ministers-but it would not have made any difference; the Labor establishment would have done the same thing-thrown out of the Ministry because they voted for 10 o'clock closing. He got a Standing Orders motion to a tie to have the Parliament get up at 10 o'clock each night. Five of Billy McMahon's Ministers voted for the motion and they all appeared in his office shortly afterwards.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suppose it is the nature of the man but Gordon Bryant told a story of going along to a branch meeting in Coburg, and I should say that he represented an area with an enormous history in Labor politics. It was one of the few areas which have consistently refused to accept whatever was cast on them. It sent Maurice Blackburn, and his wife as an independent, to this Parliament and elected Charlie Mutton for almost a lifetime as an independent member for Coburg.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordon Bryant used to attend branch meetings almost as an act of faith-and he did not have the New South Wales preselection system to drive him on. But on one occasion he said, `Well, the system really is unfair. Here are Jack Walton and I sitting at the front of the branch, as we always do, and Jack Galbally has turned up for the first time probably in five years and they cheer him'. But I think Gordon was a person who contributed much. He was a parliamentary performer. He believed in the process.
      </para>
      <para>
       He took part in the defence of his country, and he opposed the Vietnam war. He was wounded as a civilian soldier, but got himself fit to join the Australian Imperial Force and served abroad. Before he joined the Services, he was actually blown up in an accident with a hand grenade, which would have rendered most people unable to contribute.
      </para>
      <para>
       He is honoured by all of those who knew him. I suppose that it is the nature of the man that there is no-one I know of on either side of politics who has a bad word for him, even though there are those who believe that his administrative policies were something less than they would have expected.

       Gordon Bryant and I knew each other reasonably well. I always used to criticise him for not having left the chamber. One day, not so very long ago, he said, `Don, I want you to promise me that, if there is ever an obituary for me in the Parliament and you are there, you will raise this issue, firstly to show that I had a spirit of independence and secondly to show that my regard for Parliament was so high and so deep that, when such nonsense was performed in putting me out, I believe that future parliaments should know about it'.

The second thing I want to raise relates to what the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was saying about Gordon Bryant's Parliamentary Library interests. It is all true. Gordon was almost fanatical about things connected with the Library. I never sat on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Library with him, but our friendship started because of our constant discussion of books-discussion which, of course, I still enjoy with the honourable member for Lalor.

       Gordon Bryant was in great trouble because the Library Committee in those days had control of both the National Library and the Parliamentary Library. The National Library had the opportunity of buying a rare, internationally famous collection of Portuguese works. Gordon was absolutely enthusiastic and, as some speakers have said, that meant a lot. The Library finished up buying the collection because he believed that if a library or nation was to be famous or sound it should have broad vision. He said that with one of our neighbours speaking Portuguese-namely, East Timor-it was important that our National Library should have these major Portuguese works. I just mention those two points because they have not been raised before.
      </para>

       Everybody talks about his sense of humour. I remember him for that, but I also remember him for his sense of fun. In this Parliament, he was the man of the grand gesture.

I would not have spoken had I not had the opportunity to meet and work with Gordon Bryant, not in the Parliament but some considerable time after he had left the Parliament, because even though he was no longer here he still maintained that commitment to Aboriginal affairs and in the mid-1980s was a very active campaigner, continuing to attend this Parliament and other places in support of the Aboriginal cause.

       However, there is one matter that has not been referred to in any substance in the course of this condolence motion but ought to be referred to, and that concerns the role of Gordon in championing the cause of the 1967 referendum. The Leader of the Opposition, to his great credit, made reference to Gordon Bryant's moves and support for the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a real say in matters affecting their future. Of course, it should be recorded that was it not for Gordon Bryant and, indeed, many others-but, in particular, I think it is important to recognise Gordon Bryant-in pushing for that 1967 referendum, so much that has happened since that time in this Federal Parliament simply could not have occurred. The fact is that the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is based on that Federal power conferred on the Commonwealth in 1967.

       It should also be recorded that Gordon Bryant was a conciliator and worked tirelessly in the period leading up to that referendum to build bridges with the Opposition and, indeed, secured the support of numerous members of the Opposition, including Billy Wentworth, who actively supported that cause. In showing us the way forward, he left an enduring contribution to the Parliament and the country.

In the early 1950s he and I were part of a minority group within the Australian Labor Party which was such a minority that it did not even deserve a title. It could not ascribe to ever being a faction, but in 1955 we saw this small group, which in many ways represented, as Gordon himself did, the views and aspirations of working people, become a majority and Gordon Bryant came into the Federal Parliament.

       I remember Gordon Bryant in many ways. I remember him first of all for his continued and passionate advocacy on behalf of the Aboriginal people. When I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and after Gordon Bryant had left the Parliament, there were two former Ministers for Aboriginal affairs who people could often run into in the most remote parts of Australia; one was Billy Wentworth and the other was Gordon Bryant. They never lost their devotion or their commitment.

       On one occasion during the Vietnam war when I did not expect to meet Gordon Bryant, I met him in a remote village in North Laos when we were visiting Mong tribesmen. He had come there by himself; I was there as part of a small delegation. The tribesmen had prepared what could be described only as a mysterious alcoholic brew, which was served in a great pot with one straw. As Gordon was the elder of the group, it would be his task to take the first sip. I thought that this would be something of a difficulty for Gordon, who was all his life a teetotaller. I reminded him of his long period of abstinence, and all he could say was, `Comrade, if I die instantly, I do not expect you to drink it'.

       Gordon Bryant was a man of great compassion. When I came into the Parliament it was my great privilege to sit next to him. If there was one thing as certain as day follows night, it was that when the Leader of the House would do as Leaders of the House are wont to do from time to time-that is, move the guillotine-Gordon Bryant would be on his feet. Those who are in opposition and still feel some injustice about those matters-which most of us on this side of the House have suffered more than current members of the Opposition have-could do far worse than read Gordon Bryant's speeches on those occasions when he defended the Parliament as an institution, and not for the sake of it, but because he genuinely believed that this was the place where views had to be expressed and where arguments had to be fought out. He thought that any kind of injunction which restrained that was brewed in hell and was the work of the devil.

       Gordon Bryant has left his mark upon the Labor Party and upon this institution.

I am only sorry that I could not be present at his funeral, because at that stage I was very deep in Arnhem Land doing things which would have been very close to Gordon's heart. He will be missed by the people who knew him and loved him in the Labor Party and he will be missed by his colleagues on all sides of the Parliament. I extend my deepest regrets and sympathies to Pat and his sons.

I chuckled to myself when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in moving the motion, made the observation that he found Gordon a difficult act to follow as the member for Wills. When I was first elected, the electorates of Burke and Wills adjoined each other. In one of the very early phone calls I got, I was asked to ring Gordon Bryant. When a new member of parliament is rung by one of his heroes from the past who wants to talk to him, that new member immediately responds. So I rang Gordon, and he said, `You are the new young bloke for Burke?'. I said yes, and he said, `Well, I am the old fellow from Wills. You can call me the ghost who walks, because Bob will be pretty busy so I am still looking after the electorate and I would like you to help me out a bit with it'. We developed a bit of a relationship. Every time Bob took a position or did something Gordon thought might have gone in another direction, I would get a phone call from the ghost who walks.

       I too would like to make an observation on his funeral. I was quite taken by the fact that at a State funeral there was such a range of people, from the Governor-General, former Speakers of the Parliament and the Prime Minister's wife through to very ordinary people from his former constituency of Coburg. It was an extraordinary experience to see that range of people turn out to pay their last respects to Gordon and particularly to see his former service colleagues pay him the tribute that was owing.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was taken by the story that one of the State members of parliament, Giovanni Sgro, told at the funeral as an illustration of just how Gordon Bryant had his electorate of Wills under control-he was known as the people's man. One very busy Saturday morning when the tram was slowly crawling down Sydney Road, Coburg, the tram driver stopped the tram, got out, stopped all of the traffic and insisted that Gordon Bryant cross the road in front of everyone and, apparently, he did that without protest.
      </para>
      <para>
       My other reason for briefly commenting today is that during the period of the last Parliament the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs conducted an inquiry into the ways in which we might foster the active involvement of retired people in the community and I think the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) is in the process of responding to that at the moment. Gordon, through his activities with the Yarra Valley University of the Third Age, followed that inquiry everywhere and rang me constantly to find out how it was going. In doing so, he demonstrated his continuing interest in the affairs of the Parliament and the things that we might be doing to better the lot of people in all sorts of situations.

       I would like to add my thoughts to this motion and join with the Parliament in passing my condolences to Pat and to Gordon's family.

         —I inform the House of the death of Edward Albert Robertson, a former Senator, and Norman James Parkes, CBE, a former Clerk of the House of Representatives. Ted Robertson died on 7 January 1991. He represented the Northern Territory from 1975 to 1987. During this period he was a very active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, served on the branch executive for a considerable period and represented the Parliament in this capacity, both in Australia and overseas.

        Norman Parkes, who died on 29 January 1991, was Clerk of the House of Representatives from 1971 to 1976. It may interest honourable members to know that his father was also the Clerk of the House. Mr Parkes was a respected officer who served the Parliament with distinction for 42 years. After Norm Parkes's death I received a letter from former Speaker, Jim Cope, which I would like to read to the House. It says:

        Having served as a Temporary Chairman of Committees for several years and later for two years as Speaker during the period of Norman Parkes as Clerk of the House of Representatives, I received splendid advice, assistance and cooperation from Norman; as a result, a good and lasting friendship developed between us. His sad and untimely passing came as a great shock to me and I would like to be associated with any motion of regret which might be passed in the House of Representatives.

       Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to a couple of matters related to this motion. The first is that it is provisional-it relates to this block of sittings. This is a trial period: we will see how these terms and conditions work out and the Parliament will have an opportunity to determine an attitude to that in the Budget sittings.
      </para>
      <para>
       By and large, these regulations laid down in the motion are in line with those established earlier by the Senate to govern its proceedings. However, there are some differences. This motion contains penalties for breaches in the rebroadcast area. It also contains more detail on how the issue of misrepresentation and subsequent withdrawal should be handled in rebroadcast. Otherwise, as I said, these propositions are much in line with those previously carried by the Senate, which have governed its proceedings to this point.

        —The Opposition welcomes the decision by the Government to televise the proceedings of the House of Representatives. Our only concern, of course, is that it has taken so long for the Government to take this decision and to move the motion that has just been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). On this issue, like so many issues, the Government has been moving at a snail's pace. When this building was opened in May 1988 it was complete with the technical facilities required to televise Parliament. From a technical point of view, we could have televised the House of Representatives and the Senate very soon after, if not from the time, the building was completed.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Honourable members will recall that on the first sitting day of this Parliament on 8 May of last year, in his comments on your election, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) urged the Government to work towards raising the standards of Parliament. He subsequently urged the Government to allow the televising of the House of Representatives. At that time the Leader of the Opposition said that he believed that this would go a long way towards improving the standards of this chamber and improving the public's perception of politicians and the political process in Australia. As we all know, our standing in the community is not as high as it should be. There is a sense of disillusionment in the community about politicians, about what they promise and about what they deliver.
      </para>
      <para>
       It must be said, Mr Speaker, that the quality of debate in this chamber, which at times includes personal vilification and language, if used in a pub, would incite a brawl. This has added, of course, to the public's sense of disenchantment with politics. By televising Parliament and opening the procedures of this chamber to television viewers around Australia, I believe that we will be imposing a discipline upon ourselves, and in particular upon the Government, to raise our standards, address the urgent issues which confront our nation and show the people who voted for us that we can responsibly represent their interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       I hope that the passage of the motion that is before the House will result in answers to questions being more relevant than they have been in the past. I believe that there is already evidence that this House will sit for longer periods than in the past. I suspect and I hope that the guillotine will be used more sparingly than it has been used in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the course of the past year there have been several occasions on which the Leader of the Opposition has raised with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the desirability of allowing the televising of Parliament. A motion moved in this House at the end of the previous autumn session was opposed by the Government. For some reason the Government has been slow in the extreme in accepting our proposals. In fact, it was only last Friday, with almost indecent haste, that the Leader of the Opposition was advised that the House of Representatives would be open to television from today.
      </para>
      <para>
       That said, the Opposition welcomes the Government's decision. This, I believe, will go down as a significant day in the history of the Australian Parliament. I acknowledge the comments made by the Leader of the House that this is for a trial period. Our side of the House, along with the Government, will want to review the operation of the procedures and the guidelines that are contained in this motion. It has already been brought to my attention that the procedures that are proposed are more restrictive than those that apply in the House of Commons. For example, in the House of Commons the cameras are allowed to pan around the chamber during Question Time. This, of course, makes it more interesting for the viewers. The Opposition welcomes this belated motion.

Mr Speaker, with due respect, paragraphs (d) and (e) of the exclusions quite clearly give you the opportunity to exclude any abuse of the point of order privilege. On the other hand, we have just spoken for one hour about a man who is held in hugely high regard, Gordon Bryant, for his defence of the parliamentary institution. Surely the point of order is fundamental to the parliamentary debate and, consequently, the parliamentary institution-particularly when the government of the day is abusing the processes of the Parliament and can be brought to order only by a point of order. Surely the content of that point of order should be made available to the general public.

Having come from a local government body that has allowed open access to television for the last 10 years without any problems whatsoever, I am surprised that the Government has found it necessary to add so many conditions. As it is a trial period, the Government could have given totally open access. In fact, some of the conditions, particularly the one concerning satire or ridicule, are certainly not within the control of the media. In fact, if we enforce that condition we cannot have television.

         —What we deliberately did was face the fact that we had a position where, in these precise terms, expenditure in the Australian economy was increasing by 10 per cent, with production increasing by 5 per cent. If that had been allowed to go on we would have had a totally unsustainable position in terms of inflation and our current account and foreign debt situation.

        As I have pointed out, we acknowledge that in the process many people around this country have suffered pain, and we regret that fact. It is the fact that we will come out of this recession in this year, and as an Australian economy we will come out of it much stronger because we have now beaten down inflation to a point where the underlying rate, as disclosed by the official statistics, is at the lowest figure it has been since those records have been kept. We have already achieved a 28 per cent improvement in the first six months of this year in our current account deficit, compared with the previous year. The current account deficit, as against the Budget forecast of $18 billion, is running at $8.1 billion for the first six months.

        Mr Speaker, allied forces have achieved significant results while suffering few casualties. Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear production facilities have been severely damaged, and their capacities in this area have been set back very many years; the Scud missile capability has been significantly reduced; Iraq's air force has surrendered the skies; the Iraqi navy has been largely destroyed; and the military and strategic infrastructure of Iraq has been severely damaged. The air strikes, as honourable members would know, I think, are now concentrating on Iraq's ground forces in and around Kuwait. I will not add to the speculation about the timing of a ground offensive, but President Bush has made it clear publicly and privately to me that nothing will rush him into a ground war. The allies will move if and when it suits them. They control the tempo of the war.

        Australia's ships have been continually involved in operations in the Gulf. Success has been replaced by Westralia, which is now replenishing allied ships in the Gulf. Sydney and Brisbane have spent most of their time with the Midway carrier group, but each has also undertaken other escort duties with ships from a number of allied navies. Our ships have not been directly attacked and have sustained no damage or casualties, but I remind the House that mines and air launched missiles remain a serious hazard.

        Let me finally go to the question of the post-war prospect and say that the war, of course, can end at any time-whenever Saddam Hussein decides to leave Kuwait. Otherwise it will end when his armies are driven out and regional security is restored, as authorised by the United Nations resolutions. It is important to know that the allies are now looking ahead to make sure that when the war ends we can work together to establish a new framework for peace in the Middle East, encompassing not only the Gulf region but the important issues of the security of Israel, the rights and interests of the Palestinian people and, not least importantly, to try to get peace into that tragic country of Lebanon. Australia will play whatever role is appropriate in these efforts.

        I would suggest that when he does his reading he might also wonder whether he still adheres to what he had to say about the timing of decision-making when he criticised the Treasurer and myself and the Reserve Bank in January of last year, when we began the process of easing monetary policy.

        The clear position of the Leader of the Opposition is that this Government has erred in easing monetary policy as early and as quickly as we have done. Rather than trying to find some position between the Treasurer and myself, he should start to analyse his own inadequate decision and ask himself whether he still believes that this Government began to ease monetary policy too early last year.

         —I thank the honourable gentleman for his question, and let me cover this matter in its entirety. We have referred frequently to the presence in the Gulf of Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel serving on exchange with forces of the United States and the United Kingdom, and I will go to those references. For example, I referred to them specifically in my statement on 17 January. I quote what I had then to say:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Our thoughts go to these ships' crews, to the medical teams serving on the hospital ships, to the logistic support team in the region, and to the Australians serving on exchange with other allied forces in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        The number of such people fluctuates-today the figure is 28. Some of these people are involved in the planning function, which includes intelligence. I announced that the ADF would become involved in such activities in my statement to the Parliament on 4 December. Let me remind honourable members of what I had to say on that occasion:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will now authorise the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to deploy ships of our task force from the Gulf of Oman into the Persian Gulf to exercise and operate with allied naval forces in preparation for that role.
       </para>
       <para>
        I then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The ADF will also now participate in allied military planning.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray has also discussed this publicly. I will refer to what he had to say at one of his press conferences:
       </para>
       <para>
        We have people involved in the planning process, both in Riyadh and in the Naval Command. Now I'm not going to go into any more detail on that, but they do get access to all information, are actively involved and they will bring back some very valuable lessons.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there we have those three statements-two by myself and one by the Minister. The deployment of exchange personnel, as I think you, Mr Speaker, will appreciate, is a long established element of our Gulf commitment. It is not an escalation of any sort.
       </para>
       <para>
        From the beginning, I have valued the support of the Opposition generally and of the Leader of the Opposition, in particular, for the Government's position in this matter. However, if the Opposition begins to criticise the Government in any respect, it ought to get a more substantial basis for its criticism than anything that is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald because that is a very unworthy and unsound basis of support.

         —I have referred to the citizenship visits program in the House on earlier occasions. It was designed to encourage schoolchildren to visit the national Parliament and other national institutions. We have just taken a decision to televise the proceedings of the Parliament. I have not always been entirely convinced about the reasons for that decision, but, nevertheless, we have now decided to do it and, at the very least, it will transmit our disembodied images into the living rooms of Australia. I might say, though, that there is nothing quite like being here. The reason for this program is to ensure that young Australians at school can have the opportunity to visit the national Parliament, not just to see the proceedings within the chamber, but also to learn more about the operations of the Parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This project was started as a pilot program funded under the projects of national significance program. As a result of the pilot program, the matter was reviewed and a decision was taken to make the program permanent. The decision to make the program permanent was based on its very great success. Within the brief life of the pilot, more than 6,500 schoolchildren visited the Parliament. Probably almost all of those children would not have visited had this program not been in existence. They visited here at an average cost of just under $100 each.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, the program is funded by my Department and administered by the Serjeant-at-Arms. From the beginning of next year it will be funded entirely from the appropriations to the Parliament. Until the end of this financial year, it will continue to be funded through my portfolio.
       </para>
       <para>
        School visits to the Parliament are no new thing, but we discovered that almost all of those schoolchildren visiting Parliament came from nearby schools in Victoria, New South Wales and, of course, the ACT. In the six months preceding the commencement of the citizenship visits program, fewer than 500 children from the States of Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania and from the Northern Territory had visited the Parliament. In the time that the program was operating, that figure increased to about 6,000 children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The program provides a subsidy of $50 for each student travelling between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometres, $100 for those travelling between 2,000 and 3,000 kilometres, and $200 for those travelling beyond 3,000 kilometres-with a special provision of those from Tasmania receiving a subsidy of $100. I think it is important to realise that not only will this provide the opportunity for these schoolchildren from other States to visit the national Parliament and see its proceedings but also it will provide them with an opportunity to learn more about the workings of democracy itself. Through the education unit of the Parliament, they will be introduced to the way in which the electoral system works and a number of the other provisions of our democratic process.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are going to maintain the kind of enthusiasm that exists in this country for parliamentary democracy at a time when we see representative parliaments, representative democracy, becoming more and more fashionable around the world, it is important for us to encourage an adherence to those views by young people within our own community. There is no substitute, I think, for encouraging young people to come to Parliament to see how it works and, therefore, to develop a respect not only for this institution but also for the democratic process which this institution serves.

       <para>
        In 1989 the Commonwealth Government renegotiated, for example, increased funding of public housing and home purchase assistance for low income families through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The number of home purchase loans increased from about 11,500 eight years ago to a planned 40,000 this year. About 30 per cent of all first home buyers are getting help to buy their homes through this program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement has seen a major expansion of public rental housing stock, from 270,000 in 1984 to 360,000 this year. The Government has also substantially increased rent assistance for families with children which are renting privately, recognising that housing costs can be a disproportionately high cost for those families. Rent assistance for families with three or more children has risen over the last seven years from $10 to $40 a week. In real terms, it has increased by 140 per cent. For families with one or two children, it has risen from $10 to $35, or by 109 per cent, and it will be indexed from March this year. Families eligible for a family allowance supplement are also eligible for rent assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        More than half a million families with some 1.2 million children are being helped to meet the costs of bringing up their children through the family allowance supplement and payments for children through the pension and benefits system. The value of payments for children under 13 has been set at 15 per cent of the married rate of pension, currently $26.50 a week, and for children aged 13 to 15 at 20 per cent of the married rate of pension, currently $38.65 a week. This will maintain the real value of those payments. For families of the unemployed, there has been that setting of the benchmark of 15 per cent of the married pension rate for younger children and 20 per cent for older children. In addition, the family allowance is now set at a higher rate and indexed. The total payment for an unemployed family with two children under 13 which rents privately is $331.20 a week. This is a rise in real income of 24 per cent since 1983. This compares with the declining value of unemployment payments to families from 1975 to 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason I am making this serious point is that in the period 1975 to 1983 we saw the real level of assistance to families of the unemployed decline, whereas during the period of this Government, in which we have had some uncharacteristic rises in unemployment, the safety net has been strengthened so that the real level of payments, particularly for those families most in need, has not only substantially increased but has increased in proportion with the needs of those families. For example, families with older children or renting families receive the bulk of the assistance under our approach. Family payments for low income families have contributed to increasing the real income levels of the poorest 10 per cent of two parent families by 12 per cent and of sole parent families by 15 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government's approach, as I suggested at the beginning, is an integrated approach. It is not simply a question of housing; it is not simply a question of income support for families. We have also shown that commitment in terms of health, with Medicare, which is a very important part of the safety net. One does not have a poverty trap in terms of health insurance, as one has in the United States, but one has safety net protection and, in terms of the universality of Medicare, a guarantee of continuing assistance in health for people as they return to the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not simply one element, but the overall approach, the integrated approach, that means that, at a time in which many Australian families are suffering from unemployment, the Government is providing an approach which is comprehensive, which is fair, which provides an effective safety net and which guarantees that at the first opportunity there is a maximum incentive for those disadvantaged families to return to the work force when jobs become available.

He told John Laws yesterday that the State Bank of South Australia and other State banks are not federally supervised, yet the Premier of South Australia says that his State Bank is subject to prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Managing Director of the State Bank says that reports are provided to the Reserve Bank monthly, quarterly and annually. Moreover, the Reserve Bank says that it supervises all State banks. Would the Treasurer tell us who is correct?

         —I have said in the House on a number of occasions that the Reserve Bank informally supervises State banks. It has for as long as I have been aware of that practice. But the fact of the matter is that the Reserve Bank has limited powers, because the powers it enjoys now arise from its power under the Reserve Bank Act under the Constitution and it has no power to put in auditors or do other things which it could do with a bank registered under the Reserve Bank Act. That is the position.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        But the most important point in all this is that a bank is only as good as the business it takes on, and no Reserve Bank supervision can change the fact that if a bank embarks upon commercial lending which is unwise, unsound or untimely, as the case may be, regardless of the liquidity ratios being observed-and that is what the Reserve Bank would be interested in-there can be in the end losses impacting upon bank loans. That is what we have seen, I think, with the State Bank of South Australia. We have certainly seen that with the State Bank of Victoria and its subsidiary, Tricontinental Corporation Ltd. So the owner, the shareholder, must keep some supervision over those banks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The State Premier of South Australia, Mr Bannon, made it clear that the State Premier and Treasurer there has no power under the Act. He can consult and the board can consult with him, but he has now power of direction. The point of that was an agreed position between the Government and the Opposition in South Australia that it was desirable to remove from the political process the management of the bank, given the fact that there had been adverse publicity in some other States about political management of financial assets. But I think the truth of the position is that there always has to be, in the end, responsibilities in ownership and supervision by owners.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is obliged to keep me informed of banking policies. In addition, the Managing Director of the bank is obliged to keep the Secretary of the Treasury informed of day-to-day occurrences or changes in what might otherwise be day-to-day occurrences in the bank's lending or management policies-not on a daily basis, obviously, but something which is unusual. Of course, the Secretary of the Treasury sits on the board and, may I say, the board of the Commonwealth Bank is one of the strongest in the country in terms of its representation, the people represented on the board, and it is in that way that the Commonwealth Government of Australia-in this case this Government-exercises its ownership responsibilities with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of State banks, one can never get away from the fact that owners will always have to manage the assets that they have employed, and the notion that one can blindly turn these over to a board without guidelines or banking policy and without some reference at timely intervals to the Government or the owner is, I think, basically a nonsense. I think that this episode demonstrates that.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are very few governments in this country that manage their financial affairs more soundly and tightly than the Labor Government of South Australia under Premier Bannon.

I say at the outset that both those claims are incorrect. The Government has responded positively to the humanitarian emergency needs of the Gulf crisis and our contributions to date to emergency programs now total $5m, including $0.5m that I announced this weekend in relation to an increased grant to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. The Australian effort is appropriate relative to that of other donors and in the light of the current needs of the United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief agencies.

        We should also note that the exodus from Iraq and Kuwait that was expected following the outbreak of hostilities has not occurred in the numbers anticipated.

The Government has several options available for providing additional relief funds should they be needed for the Gulf crisis without diverting aid from other famine emergency programs, and I include amongst those the seeking, if it were necessary, of Budget supplementation for the aid vote.

        By any assessment, the Treaty is a major development in relations between Australia and Indonesia. The coming into force of the Treaty marks the opportunity for a bilateral program with Indonesia to develop petroleum resources in the Timor Gap area. In this regard, it is worthy of note that this is a world first in international relations whereby two countries have actually shared a resource rather than simply dividing the resource into two components. To that extent, I think it will have implications far beyond its significant implications for our respective countries. The issues have been very complex, but we have now in place a substantive regime to promote the exploration and development of petroleum resources in area A of the zone of cooperation. Now that the Treaty is in force, I propose to release exploration acreage in area B in May this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coming into force of the Treaty marks the end of a protracted period of negotiations-some 12 years-between Australia and Indonesia and is a landmark achievement in putting in place an innovative and comprehensive set of joint arrangements for developments in disputed offshore areas. In order to best protect the environment, the Treaty has ensured that there will be no relaxation of contracted strict environmental obligations unless given specific ministerial consideration, a matter that was raised in this House last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The joint development with Indonesia offers potentially increased oil security for Australia. It also offers the prospect of employment and participation by Australians in substantial oil development opportunities, in which Darwin and the Northern Territory will play an important role. I stress again that, by any measure, this is a matter of utmost significance between our two countries. I believe and the Government believes that it will be an enduring development in relations between our respective countries.

In some States, such as Victoria during 1988 and into 1989, we had virtually over-full employment; hence the shake-out has been more solid.

        If the honourable member is asking us what went wrong with the strategy of reducing the current account deficit, the answer is that nothing went wrong. Reducing inflation is on course for 6 per cent by year's end in June, as we forecast in the Budget in August. Next time the honourable member asks that question, he should at least think about some of the elements of it before he gets up and puts it.

On that occasion he assured me that Australia Post was going to review its policy, update it and comply with the requests that I had made. Have there been any further developments in regard to that?

         —I appreciate the question because I was going to seek an opportunity to bring the House up to date with developments that have taken place in connection with this matter. The question to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred was asked on 20 December last year. It concerned the policy of Australia Post on the issue of commemorative stamps. The essence of my reply to the honourable member on that occasion was that Australia Post had reconsidered its policy not to issue commemorative stamps recognising the anniversaries of political parties in Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Following some informal discussions between myself and Australia Post, I was advised of its decision of 18 December 1990, when it agreed that `the current stamp and stationery issue policy be amended by removing from the subject specifically excluded . . . anniversaries of major political parties'. I was aware that that decision paved the way for Australia Post to issue a commemorative stamp this year in recognition of the centenary of the founding of the Australian Labor Party and the issue of a commemorative stamp in 1996 to commemorative the fiftieth anniversary of the Liberal Party of Australia. I was not advised that the meeting also noted that, if the reaction of the Opposition was unfavourable, the matter would be taken back to the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 8 January this year, I returned a call to Mr Maurice Williams, the chairman of the board of Australia Post, who asked that I seek an indication of the attitude of the Opposition to Australia Post's proposal that these significant anniversaries of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia be recognised by the issue of a commemorative stamp. In the absence of the shadow Minister responsible for Australia Post, the honourable member for Menzies, I contacted the Leader of the Opposition. I spoke to him direct and followed up with a letter explaining the position and indicating that the board of Australia Post would like to be able to issue stamps to commemorate the founding of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia, which I also described as major events in the history of Australian democracy. I added, however, that in order to avoid undesirable political controversy, the board would appreciate an indication of our bipartisan acceptance of such recognition. Unfortunately, that bipartisan acceptance has not been provided. I received a letter on 22 January 1991 from the Leader of the Opposition which said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Thank you for your letter of 15 January 1991 about the issue by Australia Post of stamps commemorating significant events in the history of political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot offer my support for your proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe it is appropriate that commemorative stamps be used to publicise political parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I was stunned by that response, as I am sure the vast majority of members on both sides of the Parliament will be. The policy of Australia Post has quite clearly been to commemorate major developments in and achievements of Australia's rich and diverse social, cultural and political background. To preclude the two major political parties in Australia, with the outstanding contribution they both have made to the development of Australian democracy, is absurd in the extreme.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in light of this quite foolish response from the Opposition, Australia Post has now reversed its earlier decision in order to ensure that its commendable policy for commemorating major events would not become the subject of partisan political controversy. I am disappointed with that decision by Australia Post, but I accept absolutely its right to make the decision. I believe that the Board of Australia Post would have been more than justified-while acknowledging the attitude adopted by the Opposition-in repudiating that attitude and persisting with its earlier decision to commemorate the founding of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one examines the types of organisations and events, all of them worthy, which have been recognised by the issue of commemorative stamps, this decision by the Board of Australia Post which it must feel was forced on it by this absurd response from the Opposition, is made to look even more ridiculous. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are major institutional elements of the great fabric of democratic structures and arrangements which exist within Australia. To have endorsed the bipartisan recognition of both of those parties would have been an expression of our political and social maturity. The position adopted by the Liberal Party, which has denied that recognition, is petulant, foolish and ridiculous and it does it no credit.

       TELEVISING OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS

         —Mr Speaker, I wish to ask you a question concerning the televising of the proceedings in the House of Representatives. Today, of course, is the first occasion upon which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has had the opportunity to televise live proceedings in this chamber and, in particular, Question Time. Of course, the special sitting relating to the Gulf issue was televised live. Could you advise the House whether the ABC is televising live the proceedings in the House of Representatives today and also what arrangements you and the President of the Senate have been able to make with the ABC in relation to the future televising of the House of Representatives and the Senate? I ask that question in the context of the arrangements that currently exist for radio broadcasts when the Senate and the House of Representatives are being broadcast on alternate days.

          —I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. Prior to Question Time, a number of honourable members raised with me the fact that they understood that the ABC was not going to televise live Question Time in the House of Representatives today but that it was going to do so at 11.55 this evening. All of those honourable members who spoke to me were amazed that on the day when the House was going to agree to permit the televising of its proceedings the ABC should wait until the middle of the night to put Question Time to air. Televising the House's proceedings is an historic decision and some less charitable souls might say that the judgment of the ABC on this occasion is, itself, historically consistent. I personally find the decision rather extraordinary. The ABC has known since last week that the House would be televised today. On a number of occasions the Managing Director of the ABC has expressed his interest in having Question Time televised and has said that he thought it would be of benefit to the nation and to the ABC.

         I guess we are trying to do our bit to ensure that the audience reach of the national broadcaster is increased, but it obviously does not seem to have appreciated our efforts. I understand that discussions are taking place with the ABC about an alternate arrangement for televising Question Time in the House of Representatives and the Senate and when the outcome of those are known I will advise the House.

In view of the fact that, depending on the time of the year, up to 100 per cent of the air, both hot and cold, in Parliament House is recycled, and following the decision in the Federal Court of Australia last week that statements by the tobacco industry were misleading in respect of the issue of the ill effects of passive smoking, what action will you and your colleague, the President of the Senate, now take to extend the ban on smoking, which applies in some areas of the Parliament House, to the whole complex?

          —I am aware of a recent judgment relating to the effects of passive smoking and the legal liabilities which could arise as a result. I also understand that that judgment is subject to review. I have asked officers of the Parliament to obtain a copy of the judgment and advise the President and me of its implications. Parliament House, in many ways, is a unique building in that we work here for a lot longer than do people in ordinary employment. Honourable members are no doubt mindful of those long hours and the stressful circumstances under which we work. However, the President and I have taken a number of measures in regard to smoking in Parliament House. Smoking is not permitted in the enclosed public areas of the building. Many of the staff areas in the parliamentary departments and the cafeteria have been designated non-smoking areas. No restrictions as yet apply to members of parliament smoking in their offices or in the Members' Dining Room.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Even before the recent judgment, the President and I had referred the issue of smoking in Parliament House to an advisory group of members of parliament. They will no doubt take the judgment into account and will advise us of any measures that are thought necessary as well as our capacity to enforce the regulations on the different occupants of the building. When that committee reports to the President and me, we will make some decisions. We will also be awaiting the outcome of the appeal against the judges' decision that passive smoking did have some carcinogenic effect.

         —It is my awesome responsibility to inject some chilling reality into the proceedings of this Parliament. The need to do that is more than exemplified by the answer of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in Question Time which showed that clearly he is now hopelessly out of touch with what is happening at the coal face, particularly with regard to the unemployed in such places as Geelong, Victoria generally, and rural and regional Australia-indeed, almost all parts of Australia. It is time that we brought the message to Canberra to sheet home to the Government, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that there is economic agony right across Australia; that the true situation is that the economic clock stands at two minutes to midnight and that small, medium and large businesses, farmers, related service industries and many others face financial ruin this year as a consequence of the economic recession which was, to quote the Treasurer, `the recession we had to have'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Rather than rely on anecdotal evidence, of which there is plenty-as all honourable members know only too well as they go back to their electorates between parliamentary sittings and attend economic crisis meetings and inspect the massive flood damage in Queensland, which will add several notches to the extent of the economic recession, indeed the economic depression, existing in parts of Australia-I want to turn to some chilling statistics so that the reality will be sheeted home with regard to our rural industries and the economy more generally. Those statistics show, for example, that for the quarter October to December 1990 there was an increase of 56.8 per cent in the number of bankruptcies compared with the same period in 1989-the same quarter 12 months before.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take that a step further and look at the outlook for the farm sector arising to a large extent from many of the broadly based policies of this Government as well as, I admit, international factors and many other factors. But primarily the fundamental cause of the problem rests with this Federal Government. As my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), points out, wheat industry operation surpluses will be down 68 per cent this year and there will be a further 37 per cent reduction on top of that next year. The operating surplus in the wool industry will be down 82 per cent this year and a further 139 per cent next year. These are crushing figures with a very human dimension to them in terms of the operation of so many properties, small businesses and family farms across Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the citrus industry the real gross unit value has declined 26 per cent this year, with a very uncertain future ahead. In the sugar industry, the average return from sugar sales will be down 4.4 per cent with a further 11.4 per cent decline next year. The beef industry, one of our brighter prospects, will be down 14 per cent this financial year and has once again an uncertain future with more recent action by Taiwan. There is some hope with the overall liberalisation that Taiwan states it is going to proceed with and Japan is going to proceed with on 1 July. On an overall basis, net farm cash income will fall around 40 per cent-these are the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics projections-with a further significant decline projected for next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Liberal and National parties come here this afternoon on the first matter of public importance to be televised to present a very strong case as to why the Government has got it wrong. I will deal with some broad based aspects of this. My colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) will deal with some more specific aspects, particularly in relation to the impact of income equalisation deposits and other matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, on a general basis, let me tell the House that charge No.1 in terms of the conduct of this Government is its interest rate policy, its wrong overall monetary and fiscal political settings, which has resulted in interest rates being too high for too long and, even at their current levels, still twice the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of so many of our competitors. Charge No. 2 is that we still have a regulated labour market in this country greatly adding to the cost burden of so many industries in an unfair way whilst the pace of deregulation has been forced in other areas. Charge No. 3 is that this Government has failed to act in real terms in dealing with the matter of protection, in facing up to the sacred cow of the motor vehicle industry and other industries, whereas we have found a better way. We have stated very clearly where our policy direction is heading in that regard. As a result, farmers and, indeed, many people right across Australia, will pay on average $4,000 less for every vehicle they purchase as a consequence of the lowering of protection to zero or negligible levels by the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Charge No. 4 is that the Minister and the Government have perpetrated a taxation system in this country which has gutted the viability of so many industries, so many rural industries and so many businesses, large and small. For example, we still have the imposition of sales tax at $1 billion to $2 billion on our export industries. We have a level of fuel taxation which would be reduced under our alternative tax reform approach involving a comprehensive goods and services tax. Fuel taxation would be reduced for business and farming and sales tax would be abolished for transport freight and transport equipment. Of course, that would in turn also pave a much better way forward in respect of income tax levels in this country. The goods and services tax package has been detailed elsewhere. It represents the better way forward, the alternative, as indeed is our approach to deregulating the labour market, reforming levels of protection, especially associated with the motor vehicle industry, and taxation reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is time to turn more specifically to this Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, this tarnished product whom I once recommended, sought and perhaps suggested should take over as Treasurer from the disastrous Treasurer. I have now realised the error of my ways and believe that the sooner both Treasurer Keating and Minister Kerin depart their portfolios the better it will be for all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the matter of rural industries, the Minister has failed to perform where performance counts most. Indeed, he has locked in the Prime Minister to his inadequate performance. When the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) asked the Prime Minister a very careful question without notice in December last, the Prime Minister replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        I adhere to the statements of my Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As I have had cause to say before, he is the best Minister for primary industry in the history of this country . . . I have total confidence in the Minister in all respects.
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, I say that rural Australia does not share those comments of the Prime Minister. Woolgrowers across Australia do not share the confidence of the Prime Minister. Minister Kerin has failed but the cost of his failure will be borne by the backbone of our nation. I am, of course, referring to those in rural and regional Australia, especially but not only our woolgrowers. In all that happened yesterday, the saddest reflection on Minister Kerin and the Government generally is that part of his statement which says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Everything the Government has done and everything I have said over the past 18 months has been directed to the benefit of the wool industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us examine some of those quotes. On 31 May Minister Kerin said:
       </para>
       <para>
        My clear message to the market is that 700 cents is immutable. The next time the floor price is changed it will be upward.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quote No. 2:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's commitment to the 700c/kg floor is rock solid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quote No. 3:
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make it quite clear that the inquiry-
       </para>
       <para>
        the Vines inquiry-
       </para>
       <para>
        will not affect the reserve price.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement has been demonstratively proved wrong by some of the utterances at the Minister's press conference yesterday. The Minister's actions may have been directed to the benefit of the wool industry but the performance, the effect and the outcome have been an unmitigated disaster as represented by the economic agony created right across Australia. There is no point the Minister pleading his good intentions-this episode will go down in the annals of economic history as the result of many poor decisions and actions. His part in the whole episode will go down in history as an example par excellence of incompetent ministerial intervention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wool industry has been in absolute turmoil for almost a year. I can say without any exaggeration that the primary industry Minister has, no matter what his intentions, continually exacerbated the problem by making promises which could not be met. Where is the Minister's credibility now? I would suggest: in a heap. Where is the Government's credibility now with rural Australia? I can tell honourable members that it is in smouldering ruins. The saddest thing of all is that our nation's reputation around the world has been seriously tarnished as a consequence of all that has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        Enough of the Minister. We then have the help of that great lark, that backbencher, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). What was his contribution? It was some letter writing to Europe at an inopportune time, along with that lateral thinking approach which sometimes produces some real gems but at other times produces some real disasters. In terms of the wool industry, the Liberal and National parties have faced up to these issues in a very responsible way. Our core wool position is clear cut: it is that we have in fact supported the reserve price scheme on each and every day of its operation. It ceased to operate nearly a fortnight ago as we speak today.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we are all charged with doing now is finding out quickly the very best way forward in the interests of developing the best onward plans for the wool industry, the woolgrower and the nation as a whole. In that regard, let us be quite clear cut. The honourable member for Barker will cover other aspects. I want to say something about quotas. I say particularly to woolgrowers right across Australia: you were led up a garden path on the matter of wool quotas by the Minister, by other elements in the industry and by a lack of analysis of the impact of wool quotas. We had the courage on this side of the House to declare very firmly our hand against quotas.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Deputy Leader of the National Party pointed out, quotas have wrecked the peanut industry in Queensland and done much to disrupt the wheat industry across Australia. Firstly, quotas are an administrative nightmare, especially when taking a fair dinkum approach to defining a qualifying period. Secondly, quotas create legal problems on transfer. The woolgrower can sell his property, go to the Gold Coast, take his quota with him and leave the new purchaser of the land without any access to a wool quota. Thirdly, quotas distort market signals, especially when applied across the board, so that more popular wool which is selling well will be quoted down along with other wools. Fourthly, of course, quotas by their very existence will create a very costly secondary stockpile on the farms. I could go on, suffice to say that the coalition rejected quotas last year, we reject quotas now, and we will reject quotas in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are pleased to see that the Minister, in the small print of his statement yesterday, finally got it right in terms of this particular matter when he said that the Australian Wool Corporation's proposed marketing quota scheme will not proceed. That is an interesting development. At least we had the courage to take that message to country Australia, to explain our position on that and to have on the record the correct position in regard to the fundamental interests of woolgrowers.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are crisis times for many people outside the capital cities, as well as for many people inside the capital cities. This matter of public importance is directed at those people in rural industries; those people battling to survive in a situation where the economic clock is at two minutes to midnight. I say that there is a better way. There is a better alternative which will provide a firm basis for getting on with developing a strong wool industry. I say also that we should not become too negative about what has been a great industry, contributing massively to the economic development of Australia and the standard of living of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this regard it is not only a case of doing what is best for woolgrowers from this point on and recognising the reality of the situation, but it is also a case of getting on the front foot with regard to the positive marketing and selling of wool after this long period of turmoil so that we can rebuild wool markets around the world, and do it quickly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, we have reached a stage where Minister Kerin has outlived his usefulness in the portfolio of Primary Industries and Energy and where Treasurer Keating has totally outlived his usefulness in the Treasury portfolio. Both should depart those portfolios-and the sooner the better for the sake of all Australians.

         —The honourable member for Farrer and Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) started his speech by making quite a few references to general economic issues. As usual, the Leader of the National Party grabbed the baton at the wrong end. He seems to persist in swallowing the rhetoric of some of the more extremist representatives of farm organisations and parroting it back. This preoccupation by the Opposition with blaming rather than contributing to the development of constructive solutions to the serious difficulties besetting a number of rural industries in Australia is one of the main reasons the National Party has difficulty in convincing the rural population that it understands the root causes of its concern, let alone that it is capable of addressing those problems in a rational manner.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable gentleman instanced his Party's policies and, for example, suggested that there should be a further loosening of interest rates. At this stage that would be quite disastrous. We would get a second round effect of more inflation and ever higher interest rates. Interest rates have actually dropped by 6 per cent. We are in consultation with the banks at present. One bank's farm portfolio has about half of its borrowers on bills. If we look at the 90-day bill market we see that the rate is between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. Interest rates will not be the problem they once were. Of course, by definition, lower interest rates are far better than higher interest rates. With a deregulated market economy and the private sector borrowing for property speculation, the weapons available to a Treasurer in this country are somewhat limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point concerned the honourable member's favourite idea of moving to a deregulated labour market. Again I say to honourable members opposite that it is my very clear and deep belief that if we were to move to a deregulated labour market we would have not only massive exploitation but also, because we are not dealing with a proper market for labour, a wages blow-out in some areas and very low wages in other areas. Perhaps that is what honourable members opposite are on about.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the National Party of Australia then moved to his third point, which concerned nil protection. I do not adhere to nil protection. I do not think we can make that stick with the dairy, tobacco, dried vine fruits or most of the horticultural industries. Now that we are getting average levels down, we do have to concentrate on those industries that diverge from the average, such as passenger motor vehicles, textiles, clothing and footwear and the dairy industry, but I think we also ought to look at some of the ways these assistance levels are measured in some of those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member's fourth point concerned taxation, including a goods and services tax. In this regard the Government has taken a very strong stand. I think that the honourable member would concede that that too will cause all sorts of problems in rural Australia; for example, taxes on country school parents and citizens associations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member's silence in the last year in regard to a number of serious issues facing rural Australia has been notable. By and large the Opposition has been supportive of the Government's actions on wool. I understand very clearly what the honourable member is saying today. As I said at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics National Agricultural and Resource Outlook Conference, Australia's primary and resource industries remain hostage to familiar uncertainties: we are unable to control the weather; and we will continue to be dependent on overseas commodity markets, often distorted by politically expedient government intervention. The present combination of world events is the cause of a generally weaker outlook for Australia's rural industries. The sooner the honourable member recognises this, the sooner he will be able to focus on the real issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no question that in the short to medium term many of our rural industries are facing a severe test. However, the honourable member for Farrer's laying this solely at the Government's feet and implying that it is all a domestic question is really an indication of the lack of understanding that he is well known for in rural Australia. Individual farmers and their families are experiencing real difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the wool industry and the series of unprecedented events that led to the decisions I announced yesterday. The Government has taken action in response to the following unprecedented series of events. I refer to the continuing deterioration of the wool market, most of which was unforeseen; the rapidly growing stockpile of wool held by the Australian Wool Corporation-a stockpile currently of nearly 5 million bales, nearly a full normal year's production; the burgeoning borrowings of the AWC, now close to $3 billion; and the ever increasing wool levy necessary for growers to pay for the interest on the debt-25 per cent this year, projected to be 35 per cent in 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first time the Chairman of the Wool Corporation contacted me on this issue was in November 1989, my staff having earlier drawn my attention to the situation. At that time we had a 4 per cent levy on wool and we had accumulated over the years a reserve of something like $1.8 billion. Through early 1990 the suggestions were that as the market deteriorated there be a 10 per cent tax, a 15 per cent tax and then a 25 per cent tax. I brought in a 20 per cent tax and the industry went for an 18 per cent tax. Now that we have a 25 per cent tax, the suggestion is that we have a 35 per cent tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems that at some stage, when we have moved from a 4 per cent tax to a 35 per cent tax and when the industry and the Wool Corporation are asking that we put on a marketing quota of 700 million kilograms-that is a little more than seven-tenths of present production-and that is combined with the level of taxation needed, we are really looking at a return on average of about 341c. At that stage one really has to make a fundamental re-evaluation. I am glad the honourable member said what he said about quotas because I had to say to the Wool Corporation that we simply cannot go on with unlimited borrowings; at some stage we must evaluate the situation of the industry. I also told the Wool Corporation Board quite clearly that I did not think I could deliver a quota scheme through the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The events of yesterday really have been lying there for a long time in terms of dealing with the fundamentals and first principles. As the honourable gentleman has said, there is opposition by a large number of growers to the quota scheme, and that was an integral part of the Australian Wool Corporation strategy. The doubtful outlook for wool markets in the near term, especially in the Soviet Union and China, and the apparent lack of recognition, at least publicly, by the wool industry itself, and its leaders, of the enormity of the situation all resulted in the need for the Government to take actions to ensure that this vital industry does not bankrupt itself completely.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures announced are directed, over the next few years, to lead to the recovery of the Australian wool industry, and, whilst painful for all concerned in the short term, in the medium term the recovery plan will enable the Australian wool industry to compete effectively for markets. The measures provide for confidence and stability to be returned to wool markets, which have, in recent times, been suffering under the uncertainty created by the public recognition that the debt level of the AWC is not sustainable.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been taking actions to address the problem since the world market for wool began to collapse in November 1989, and over that time we have introduced a wide range of measures. They have been implemented by the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation to try to restore confidence in the market, and to put the wool industry on the road to recovery. Dropping the floor price last year, the loan guarantees, the Vines committee inquiry, the establishment of the interim Wool Policy Council, my call for a business plan and then for a strategic plan from the Australian Wool Corporation, the wool mission, the $400m USSR credit facility-all of these are examples of the actions we have been taking throughout this difficult period. But, despite the adoption of this range of measures, the situation has continued to deteriorate, largely as a result of continuing speculation that the scheme was unsustainable, and the other influences such as the crisis in the USSR and the Gulf war.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition wishes to focus on the integrity question. What the Government has tried to do-and of course, I do not have time to go through it all-through a series of actions through 1989 and 1990, month by month, is to stick with the wool industry, trying to see whether we could be convinced that industry was facing reality, or whether we could really see any way out of it other than where we got to yesterday. It has been a terrific problem for the industry to grapple with.
       </para>
       <para>
        On first principles we all know that markets eventually set price, that buffer stock schemes always fail, and that if you try to control price without controlling supply you will eventually get substitution. There is a lot of fibre substitution going on. Cotton has expanded its share. Now at least we have a chance for wool to expand its share. The other first principle that was in the back of our minds, of course, is that we were doing exactly what the United States of America did with wheat in the early 1980s, holding up the world price of wheat while other people sold it, and that eventually resulted in the Americans having to use a lot of taxpayers' funds to sell the wheat through the export enhancement program. What we are doing is exactly what the Europeans do with dairy and a range of other products.
       </para>
       <para>
        This industry is far too important to look just at first principles. One really has to try to work through it with this industry, because we have in place a scheme that has really been working successfully for about 17 years. Most of the things which have caused this crisis were unanticipated, and unanticipatable. There were three things we could anticipate. The first was that, when the dollar was floated in Australia, the reserve price scheme should have been adapted to a floating exchange rate. This was pointed out at the time. Papers were prepared, but this was ignored by the board of the Corporation. Secondly, we could have anticipated that there would be a reaction to the high prices through 1987 and 1988. There was not much one could do about that, but it should have been taken into account enough, so that when the price was set at $8.70 it could have been anticipated that this would induce or stimulate the record production we now have. Of course, the Wool Corporation at the time was told this, but again it was ignored, and in fact the person bearing the news was more or less shot. The rest was unanticipatable, and the reason I dropped the floor price was that I could not be convinced that we could trade through, even with the level of tax we were putting in place, and the level of borrowings. Again, the reasons for doing that, first of all, were so that we could get the price of wool somewhat near to its traditional level with cotton and polyester-that is, one can have wool at two or three times the price there and because of its qualities and particular values one can gain markets at that level, but once it gets to five or six times the prices of cotton and polyester, one cannot hold market share for very long.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second reason I did it was so that the wool industry did not borrow lots and lots of money to buy its own wool to put in the stockpile so that it would appreciate in value and store expensively. Already we have deadweight losses in the scheme of $1.8 billion. That is the growers' money that has been put in. It is just a question of calculating how long before it is sold, and how much other deadweight loss is there. There are calculations at present of $1.3 billion deadweight loss additionally. The third reason was that setting the price at $8.70 really meant that it was an inducement to continue production. The really big intellectual disagreement I had with the Wool Corporation and the wool growers at that time was their view that if we set the levy at 25 per cent, or 20 per cent, that would be enough to bring production down. We said no, and I am afraid we have been right. We will still have the second highest production of wool in this year. It is only down about 6 million kilograms on the previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we put all those things in place, and we tried to stick with the industry. As the situation deteriorated, as the Wool Corporation brought in various business plans, in the first business plan its worst case scenario became an optimistic one, so more legislation was required in this Parliament. The buy-in rate in November of last year by the Corporation for the year at that stage was 64 per cent-that is, the Corporation was buying 64 per cent of the wool put on the market. For the week in November before I headed off on that mission it was 62 per cent, so going overseas was very much a time to explain to our customers exactly what was happening, what the law was all about in terms of the Wool Marketing Act, and to try to stimulate the trade in the Soviet Union. We went through the buyer countries explaining the situation. I pointed out that legally, of course, the 700c price was fixed by legislation. But one really cannot fool the buyers. They were doing their own calculations. It is not as though I was on a mission trying to con our buyers. We managed to get $87.5m from the Soviet Union that it owed for wool, and there are still negotiations going on. We have not been able to get some additional money; we are still trying to gain that. We still hope that the Russians will come to Australia to buy. But the situation got worse in January, and we had to take the action we did.

         —I rise to support the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in this matter of public importance describing the Government's incompetent handling of this rather disastrous issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Rural Australia has had two major problems to deal with for the majority of the 1980s-international problems, as we all know, created by $30 billion of export and internal subsidies thrown at the American and European farmers; given to each group-and more and more subsidies every day. Those things we work at, and sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. As well as that, we have had an internal domestic, Australian made problem, cut mainly from Italian cloth, but designed and made up in Australia by our morbid economic engineer, by our national undertaker-a designer recession, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) called it; and the Leader of the National Party has described the disastrous results that that has had for rural industry and Australians generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would just like to add to what he said: those high interest rates and the consequent over-high value of the Australian dollar have been around with us for six years, and not just recently. We do not have to go much further than the South Australian economist who, just before Christmas, described those interest rates as a wave which carries on until it finally breaks- and it has certainly taken a great number of Australians with it at its breaking.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to return to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who has just left the table and the chamber. I have worked with this Minister for a number of years in various capacities, and he is described as ostensibly plausible, ostensibly economically literate and mainly personable. Over time he has worked through various industries-the dairy industry problems, the beef industry, the dried vine fruits industry and many others. Some of these industries have been somewhat successful, some of them have had fair results and some are still to be tested. He is thought by many to be a rational man who is approachable and thoughtful.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all of that period in the 1980s that I have just described he has supported, however, the Government economic line of slow rates of reform, high interest rates and a high dollar. However, in 1987 he made a disastrous mistake-he changed the rules for the wool industry and took away the checks and balances that had been in place for between 13 and 15 years, whilst maintaining the Government's taxing powers and the Australian Wool Corporation's ability to borrow on behalf of wool growers. That has turned out to be probably the most disastrous policy mistake in Australian rural history.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wool industry in this country is now faced with a minimum of $2.8 billion of external debt-this may well go to $3.5 billion-a debt servicing cost of the order of half a billion dollars a year; 4.8 million bales of wool in the sheds; and 1.5 to 2 million bales of annual oversupply. He presided over the design of some legislation three years ago which has brought about the temporary, I would say, demise of the wool industry and certainly the demise of some people in it. It has certainly brought about the demise of a conservative reserve price plan, which, as I said, ran for nearly a decade and a half until this Minister, three years ago, changed the legislation and took away the protective mechanisms which had been agreed and had worked well until that time. That was the moment of impending disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had then, of course, a move to an aggressive reserve price, and the Corporation began buying in wool and 870c became the reserve price, which finally turned out to be unsustainable, as did, sadly, the 700c. Some will blame the scheme itself. Twenty years ago people said, `Forty, 50 years ago such schemes would fail', but 20 years ago some who are still about prophesied that this scheme would fail. Some will say that putting the price to 870c made it fail; some will say that dropping the floor precipitated its demise; some will say it was high interest rates; some will say it was all sorts of other things. But one can be sure that we will all blame someone else.
       </para>
       <para>
        This industry is now faced with too much wool, too much debt, too much annual supply-nearly 2 million bales in current terms-and a reserve price scheme which has been cancelled by the Government and the Wool Corporation and which has sunk deeper than Captain Cook's cannon. For future wool growers, that is, those who have the courage to stay in the industry, it will be saddled with half a billion dollars of annual debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not wish to dwell upon the details of what should happen in regard to resurrecting this disastrous mess into the future, but I will say several things which I think are very important. In this country 15 or 16 years ago we designed something called an income equalisation deposit (IED) scheme. It was designed to recognise the highs and lows of agricultural income in this country and one was able to deposit one's money-the excess rewards of good wool years or wheat years or whatever they were-with the Government at reasonably low interest rates and redeem that money in times of hardship.
       </para>
       <para>
        When this Government got into power it removed those IEDs and poured scorn and vitriol on those who supported them. I was in the position of trying to somehow persuade this Government and this Minister to bring that scheme back. It was finally brought back in one form or another on 1 July 1990, just after the two biggest wool years in postwar history, apart from 1951. I think it was brought back at that time on purpose so that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would not have to hand back the tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars that he would not have today if that scheme was still in existence. So I put it to the House that the $300m which the taxpayer is reputedly going to hand out to the wool industry will simply not be coming from the taxpayer at all. It would simply have been, had the IED scheme been in existence, some of the wool growers' money coming back.
       </para>
       <para>
        Blame for this debacle will fly anywhere, and I will come to that in a second. However, I want to assure the Minister of one thing: the Government can pass on or it can say that it can pass on the $2.8m or the $3.5m of wool debt which will accrue, built by the Corporation on behalf of today's growers, to a necessarily lesser number of growers who will be growing wool, if they have the courage, in four or five years' time. But it could not possibly be equitable. It could not possibly be equitable to pass on to next year's growers or the year after's growers a debt built today. So it is nonsense for the Government to say it is going to charge the people who are in the industry in four or five years' time an increasing levy to finance the debts that have been built up today.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we all know when we look at that situation that who will be standing to pick up the deficit, if there is one, will be the government of the day, and we know that that will not be this Government. It is naive to think that the wool growers of tomorrow will be picking up an increasing cost met by fewer and fewer of them. Blame for this debacle will be all around the place-it is on the Country Hour today. One can hear Government members pouring out blame on everybody else but themselves. The Government can blame all of us, and everybody who did not stand up and voice his disapproval when the Government loosened this scheme three years ago, when it took away the checks and balances. But blame is cheap and responsibility is deep, and responsibility overrides all in these matters. Blame attached to the captains of the Melbourne and the Voyager in that tragedy of years ago and many others, but the Minister bore the responsibility. We all bear the blame, but this Minister and this Government bear the responsibility, and for that I have to say they will never be forgiven.

         —We have a rather curious phenomenon here of two leading Opposition spokesmen delivering what I counted to be 30 minutes of criticism of the Government's decision yesterday to suspend the reserve support scheme. Not once in that 30 minutes did either of those Opposition speakers say that they would have done anything different. Not once did they come forward with any alternative proposal, and not once in the whole 30 minutes did we ever get anywhere near anything specific except where the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) told us that if they had their chance we would be seeing a $4,000 reduction in motor vehicle prices when they introduce their approach to tariff reduction.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to come back to that because what we have just seen here today, at least to their credit, were a spokesman for the Liberal Party of Australia and a spokesman for the National Party of Australia. The last time we tackled the floor price issue, we had the barney within their parties, where the National Party did not want any change at all and in the end the Liberal Party shadow Cabinet supported the Government's decision to lower the floor price from 870c to 700c. At least here the two parties have come forward, but they have not produced anything or said anything. All they have done is spread blame somewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that late in the piece the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) did say that perhaps they should have protested more at some stage. But I do not think the honourable member did himself much credit in his little contribution here today. As a member of the Prime Minister's country task force, I sat across the table from him on many occasions during the past six years when the honourable member was president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF). We have talked about income equalisation deposits (IED) and income averaging schemes. Although he knows about it, the honourable member for Barker said absolutely nothing in his contribution today about the tax rorting that was going on with IEDs that led to the changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the NFF brought forward its proposals and asked for revisions, he quite willingly conceded that there were grounds for changing the Government's decisions and that there was room for other tax averaging measures. He was right then and he does not do himself any credit when he comes here now and says that these things should not have occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was another inconsistency that we heard absolutely nothing about in the honourable member's contribution today. In the lead up to the Government's taking the decision yesterday to suspend the scheme, we heard quite a lot from representatives of wool growers in various forums protesting vigorously about the proposed abolition-or suspension, as it turned out. We did not hear a thing from any of those people about the national wage case decision last week authorising a national wage 6 per cent flow on to shearers when the industry was in a position to pay. They march up to the national wage case saying that they want the free market to determine wages in the industry; they want the free market to determine that the prices are not there at the moment, therefore the wages cannot be there. But when it comes to the floor price they do not want a free market. Either they want the Government to leave the floor price in place or they are prepared to wander surreptitiously into this Parliament and go on with all this populist cant; that is what it amounts to-populist cant.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Members opposite do support the changes that have taken place. They supported the lowering of the floor price from 870c to 730c because they recognised the realities of the international game of bluff that was going on with our wool stockpile and they now recognise as well as anyone else the reality that the Government-whatever government-cannot simply sit by and sustain the increasing liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government deserves credit, not populist cant, for saying to the industry, `We gave a guarantee on the floor price and we will honour that guarantee.' One way or another the producer will receive the floor price for wool that has been purchased by the Corporation and for wool that is now in the stockpile. But that cannot go on for ever in a world which has simply ceased to demand that wool, so the future price for wool will be market determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        I saw a very interesting presentation by a spokeswoman from one of the organisations in the industry who made a valid case that there could be a substantial drop in the price for wool. When one took account of the levy that did not apply and the costs of holding deferred stock that did not apply, there could almost be a drop of another 50 per cent in the price and the producer would still be no worse off than if the existing situation were to prevail.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to the Opposition that this is a very carefully crafted motion. The motion does not say that those opposite oppose the decision to suspend the reserve price support scheme; rather it relates to the general incompetence in handling issues. However, every step along the way that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has taken has been one that the Opposition has supported. It is just populist cant to come here and run any other line.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the brief time available to me, I want to refer to a couple of issues that now face us and that I believe are a reality for all wool growers. About six months ago, I was talking to one of my close friends, a producer of high grade wools, and some of his colleagues. I said to them, `There are a lot of ways we can go. Where do you fellows think we should go? How do you think we should deal with the situation?'. They said, `No-one has any answers. Unless the world starts buying our wool again, all we can do is hope for the best.' That is about the strength of it. Unless the world starts buying our wool again, we simply have to deal with the situation we have. Members of the National Party of Australia who wander around Australia talking to one grower after another, getting a different view from each one and then come into Parliament and put forward these populist views, ought to remember that the world situation is different and that the reality is that Australia faces a number of international circumstances which have been the prime causes for the situation that has developed in the wool market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am actually quite disappointed in this motion. I would not mind in the least if those opposite had come in here and spoken on a motion opposing the Government's decision. For those opposite to come in here and surreptitiously put on a performance resembling opposition, while knowing very well that they endorse the decision and would have done the same thing, I think borders on deceit. That is my approach to it.

        The reality of this legislation, however, is that it may place too many impediments in the way of our armed forces and may, indeed, endanger them. To implement the protocol could subject the Australian Defence Force to such restrictions in time of war that it would not be able to operate to its full effectiveness and the lives of the service personnel concerned would be put at greater risk than they otherwise would be.

        It is with some reluctance that I have to announce on behalf of the Opposition that we are opposed to this legislation. I really did strive to see whether there was a way through in order that we could join with the Government. This legislation has a history. It has been before the Parliament before. The previous Attorney-General-after the then shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), indicated that we would be opposing the legislation-withdrew it because he did not wish it to go through without bipartisan support. It was my view-and I conveyed this to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy)-that we could consider supporting the legislation if in fact the Government would be prepared to express reservations, and I will develop this slightly later on. That seemed to me to be the most sensible way through.

        Glory be, in my own time as Foreign Minister we would ratify treaties and express reservations where there were concerns. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in a letter to the President some years ago, expressed his concerns with elements of this protocol. Had the Government been prepared to express reservations, we would have been prepared to consider supporting the legislation. But no, it wanted the protocol as it is and, as a consequence, we have been forced to oppose a measure that has quite laudable aims but which, in practice-as I will explain-in our view, could endanger our own forces.

        The dramatic developments which are unfolding in the Middle East no doubt illustrate that the objective of the protocol, the protection of civilians during times of armed conflict, is one for which we have to continually strive. Those developments also show that when one party to a conflict openly flouts time honoured conventions and principles, it is necessary for the other party to reconsider its own approach to the conflict. It is my view that the protocol, if it were made applicable to the present conflict, would place very severe and most unrealistic limitations upon the allied forces.

        Sir John Monash, at the time of the First World War, wrote that:
       </para>
       <para>
        War is not a business in which one can take any pride or pleasure, or even pretend to. Its horror, its ghastly inefficiency, its unspeakable cruelty and misery has always appalled me, but there is nothing to do but to set one's teeth and stick it out as long as one can.
       </para>
       <para>
        The conduct of armed conflict could only be rendered more inefficient, to use Sir John's words, by the protocol and, in so doing, would have the undesirable effect of prolonging such conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        Traditionally, the law relating to war or armed conflict made a distinction between the right to wage war and the rights and duties which operate once war is started. This distinction is reflected in the Latin maxim jus ad bellum-that is, the theory of a just war-and jus in bello-that is, the doctrine on the rules of warfare and the humanitarian rules that apply within war. The theory of a just war, socalled, notwithstanding the talk we have heard of a `jihad' or an Islamic holy war, has been supplanted by the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter, notably article 2.4 which contains a prohibition on the use of force in the conduct of international relations. However, that prohibition is subject to the provisions of article 51 which recognise the inherent right of nations to resort to individual or collective self-defence as an interim measure until the United Nations Security Council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security. Set out in chapter VII of the United Nations Charter is a regime under which the Security Council can act in order to endorse the use of force by member states.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is already in existence at the international level, as honourable members would appreciate, a great body of law that applies in times of armed conflict. If we look at some of the recent developments in the Gulf crisis, we can see how that law operates. I will take only a few examples. The treatment of captured allied military personnel by the Iraqi regime contravenes the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention-the convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war. Again, the treatment by Iraqi military forces of Kuwaiti civilians shows a flagrant disregard by Iraq of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention-the convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in times of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although Iraq is a signatory to the four Geneva conventions, it has displayed a contemptuous attitude to their provisions and we can have very little confidence in expecting Iraq to abide by universally accepted standards for the conduct of armed conflict and the treatment of civilian peoples. The aerial bombardment of civilian targets by Iraq in both Israel and Saudi Arabia constitutes a clear breach of the universally accepted rule that bombardment expressly directed against a civilian population is prohibited. This principle formed the basis of the Hague draft rules of 1923 on aerial bombardment which, although not fully or finally implemented, have been regarded in both doctrine and in practice as constituting binding customary international law. The draft rules of 1923 sought to elaborate upon article 25 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 which prohibits attacks against undefended civilian objects `by whatever means'-a phrase which clearly encompasses attacks from the air.
       </para>
       <para>
        The examples that I have referred to show that the existing state of international law dealing with the conduct of war is very well developed. Unfortunately, the protocol does not advance the case for humanitarian law. There are, of course, many provisions of the protocol that are worthy of support. That is why I have indicated that provided the Government was prepared to express reservations, we would go along with it. That again, as I mentioned earlier, was rejected. But many of these provisions are already contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention to which I have referred, so protection in these and other similar areas is already provided for.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of the protocol which do cause us concern and which lead us to the conclusion that the protocol should not be ratified include-and I will go through a number of them briefly-article 1.4, which provides that the protocol shall apply to certain types of wars of liberation; articles 20, 51.6, 52.1, 54.4, 55.2 and 56.4, which contain a blanket prohibition against the right of reprisal; article 35.2, which forbids the use of weaponry that may cause `superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering'; article 56.1, which prohibits attacks against dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations; article 44.3, dealing with the way in which certain combatants should distinguish themselves from the civilian population; articles 48, 49.1 and 49.2, prescribing the distinction between military and civilian objectives; articles 52 and 57, which prohibit attacks that may cause `incidental loss of civilian life'; and article 82, which obliges nations to ensure that legal advisers are available `at all times' to advise military commanders of their obligations under the protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        A most cursory reading and brief presentation of those articles would indicate to honourable members just how difficult this could be for commanders and for many engaged, though regretfully, in a time of war. One of the most controversial aspects of the protocol is its scope of application in that international armed conflict is defined to include some forms of internal conflict involving wars of national liberation. Unlike the provisions of article 1.1 of the second protocol, it is not necessary that there be in existence a certain level of intensity of conflict for protocol I to become operative.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 1.4 of protocol I provides that the provisions of the protocol apply to international armed conflicts as defined in common article 2 of the Geneva Conventions, and to `armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination'. The most troublesome aspect of this provision is the words `alien occupation', appearing in article 1.4, as they introduce extraordinarily great uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have taken this stance assuming that the Government is being fair dinkum about the implementation of these protocols and that it will adhere to them. If it does, honourable members will find by the examples that I have referred to that our own men and women in the field would be severely constrained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those words that I have just referred to, `alien occupation', unlike the phrases `colonial domination' or `racist regimes', have no settled meaning at all in international law. A good example is how one would classify the situation that existed in Cambodia vis-a-vis the Phnom Penh Government backed by Vietnam? Would the civil war waged by the Khmers and other elements be viewed as a fight against `alien occupation'? This is obviously only but one of many examples of civil wars involving so-called puppet regimes that are scattered across the globe.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is clear that the scope of the protocol is extremely wide. Its application to wars of liberation was an issue not only of great concern to us, but also of very great concern to our major ally, the United States. In elevating armed conflicts of this sort to an international status, the protocol, inadvertently in my view, revives the notion of a just war, or jus ad bellum, that I was referring to earlier. The classification by the protocol of certain conflicts as being equivalent to armed conflicts between nation states when they are just not, very much depends upon what could be subjective elements. So too do the complementary provisions in the protocol dealing with guerilla warfare-particularly article 44.3, which sets out problematic distinctions between regular combatants, civilians and non-regular or guerilla combatants-compound the problem and blur the traditional distinction between international and civil wars.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now I turn to the prohibition against reprisals, which can be found in the various articles that I mentioned earlier. In considering this, it should be borne in mind that if one party to a conflict causes a fundamental breach of the protocol the other party is still bound to conduct its operations in conformity with the provisions of the protocol. The wide prohibition against reprisals conflicts funda- mentally with the right of self-defence that is recognised in article 51 of the United Nations Charter. I am trying to refer to matters of international law in this debate rather than to the argument about the Gulf, which has been outlined frequently in this House in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        But fundamental to our argument about these forces acting under the aegis of a UN Security Council resolution is our argument that there is a right of collective self-defence vested in nations under the Charter of the UN. That is one of the factors that I thought the Government would have sought to indicate a reservation about in terms of the restriction on reprisals. In international conflicts, it must be fairly obvious that often the threat of reprisal-just the mere threat of reprisal-is the most effective and sometimes the only means of bringing an end to breaches of international law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cold War in many ways guaranteed a fair degree of stability by the sheer fear that if the Soviet Union, for example, launched an attack on the United States, there would be reprisals. One of the major reasons for the stability was the peace that was brought about through the security of one being armed against the other and the fear of some reprisal being launched.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would infinitely prefer a set of circumstances where we were not forever engaged in a cold war and where in fact we were working for not a unilateral but a gradual and mutual elimination of weapons of war. But we have to face reality. We are involved in an international conflict at the present moment. All I am doing is pointing to the fact that the threat of a reprisal will frequently bring to an end a breach of international law on the part of another country. Indeed, Frederick Manning in his novel The Middle Parts of Fortune-albeit that it was a novel-rather aptly wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        War is waged by men; not beasts, or by gods. It is a peculiar human activity. To call it a crime against mankind is to miss out at least half its significance; it is also the punishment of a crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fundamental to the function of armed conflict as a means of punishing violations of international law is in fact the right of reprisal, a right which can be exercised only in very limited circumstances and which is subject always to the principle of proportionality. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who are at the table, must understand that. They know from speeches that I have made before that I am not in favour of just turning my back on the protocols to Geneva Conventions. One strives to find one's way through.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why I said that, if we could only have a set of circumstances where we could be in agreement on exercising reservations, which is not totally unknown-this Government has already ratified agreements during its period in office when it has expressed reservations-we would have had the bipartisan support that previously was expressed as the desire. No-one on this side gets any pleasure through opposing the protocol. We are simply doing it because we feel that the Government could be placing in jeopardy those who are directed to serve by dint of the decision of the Government in armed conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fundamental to the function of armed conflict as a means of punishing violations of international law is the right of reprisal, and reprisal is forbidden under this protocol. It is a right which can only be exercised, as I think I indicated, in very limited circumstances, and I mentioned the principle of proportionality.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time of the negotiations for the protocol, the Australian delegation entertained reservations. This is what was interesting. When there were negotiations involving the determination of this protocol, as I understand it, the Australian delegation entertained reservations concerning the extent of this prohibition against reprisals. I quote what the Australian delegation said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a reprisal is a sanction to deter further violations of the law. It is not an act of vengeance. The availability of this sanction may persuade an adversary not to commit violations of the law in the first place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are not my words but the words of the Australian delegation negotiating this very protocol. Saddam Hussein has, on several occasions, sent out clear signals that he has no qualms about using chemical or biological weapons. This, of course, would be in contravention of many international instruments, including the Geneva protocol of 1925. The United States has maintained that it must reserve its right to resort to such weapons in defence. It does not want to use them and will do all it can to avoid doing so. But this reservation acts as a deterrent and must cause Saddam Hussein to think twice about unleashing weapons of mass destruction and slaughter, the effects of which on human beings are known.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney is one of the most reasonable members of this current Government, but on this issue he has shown a more closed mind than on most. He is a man for whom I have the greatest respect, but he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) seem to have taken the view that any reservations to the protocol would be incompatible with its objects and, therefore, would not be permissible under article 19(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the greatest respect to the Attorney, I disagree. In practice, and having regard to the provisions of article 21 of the Vienna Convention, the effectiveness and legitimacy of such reservations very much depends upon the attitude taken by non-reserving states. If they remain silent, the reservation takes effect and the legal effect of the treaty on the reserving party is thereby modified. Alternatively, if they object to the reservation but not to the treaty coming into force, the effect is the same. Of the nations which have ratified the protocol, many have lodged reservations in order to address their concerns with the ambiguities found in the text of the protocol. We would not be Robinson Crusoe, we would not be on our own; many, as is always the case, have expressed reservations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Government proposes that, should ratification take place, a declaration of understanding be lodged dealing with certain aspects of, as I understand it, articles 5, 44, 51, 52 and 57. These are the articles that the Government itself has admitted it has concerns with, so it is going to lodge a declaration of understanding. But a declaration of understanding is not a reservation. It just does not have the same meaning in international law. It is only an interpretative instrument and does not alter at all at the international level Australia's obligations under the protocol. We on this side of the House take the view that, given what the Prime Minister himself has acknowledged as the `ambiguities and operational complexities' of the protocol, what is needed are reservations to address the uncertainties that are created by the protocol in order to protect Australia's defence interests. Such reservations need to be very wide and must, amongst other things, preserve our right of self-defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to consider the way in which the protocol attempts to make distinctions between civilian objects and military objects with a view to extending the protection afforded to the civilian population during armed conflict. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, noted that in times of war:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . such distinctions can become blurred and indistinct, and ultimately may even cease to exist in conditions of total war.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of section 1 of part IV of the protocol-which contains the relevant provisions for the making of these distinctions-is to undermine the practicalities of doing so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 48, which is referred to as the `basic rule', obliges nations `at all times' to `distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objects' and to direct military operations `only against military objectives'. I emphasise the word `only'. Article 49 defines attacks to mean `acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence'. So we see that this `basic rule' has a very wide ambit of operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 51.4 prohibits what are called `indiscriminate attacks' which include, by reason of Article 51.5(b), attacks:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise the words `may'-that is, not shall or likely-`incidental', not significant or substantial, and `concrete and direct'. Similar language is used in article 57.2(a) (iii) which obliges nations to refrain from planning or deciding upon attacks which may have these effects. To compound the problem, paragraph (b) of article 57.2 provides that an attack shall be cancelled or suspended if, during the conduct of the attack, it becomes apparent that the attack `may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life'.
       </para>
       <para>
        These provisions attempt to codify the well established principle of proportionality by which nations are obliged to not conduct military operations which cause unwarranted damage to civilian objects-something with which we would all agree. The real problem that arises with protocol I is the manner in which it attempts to reformulate this principle. The language adopted goes beyond a simple codification of the principle.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of article 56-which prohibits attacks on dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations or other installations containing dangerous forces-provides another illustration of the difficulties that the protocol would pose for our defence forces. In paragraph 1 of article 56, it is said that this prohibition applies `even where these objects are military objectives'. Under paragraph 2, the protection is removed if the normal function, as it is put, of the installation is to provide regular, significant and direct support for military operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of the allied bombing effort in the present conflict has been directed towards disarming Iraq's nuclear and chemical capabilities by attacking the very type of installations upon which article 56 seeks to bestow immunity. In making the hard decisions that are needed, I would hope that military commanders are not bogged down with legal niceties as to what the `normal function' of such an installation is, or whether or not there are three orange circles on such installations. We have heard much about sophisticated weaponry, precision bombing and smart missiles, but I think that, notwithstanding these technologies, article 56 is simply impossible in realistic military terms to comply with.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 1 of part III of the protocol deals with the methods and means of warfare. I intended to take the House through article 35 and the concerns I have there. There are particular concerns here in regard to the English translation and the French translation which leads to different words being used and various textual arguments introducing a very different subjective element in terms of suffering, the way injuries are addressed in that particular area. But as I draw to a conclusion in time I am simply unable to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality of my remarks is that we, having participated in government at the outset of the deliberations on this protocol, wanted to achieve a sensible outcome. I understand the Government's desire to implement the protocol. I do not quite understand why it will not go along with expressing reservations rather than lodging the declaration of understanding, which it is now going to do, because both the Prime Minister's letter to President Reagan, as he then was, which leaked into this House some years ago with a reservation and the expressed concerns and the preparedness to lodge a declaration indicates to me that there are concerns in the minds of many in the Government over this issue. So make it neater, make it correct at international law and protect our own servicemen by expressing reservations. Were the Government to do that, we would give the Government support. But without that, we oppose the legislation.

         —It is a pleasure, as always, to follow the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in a debate of this kind. I imagine few people in this House have followed the processes of development of international law, particularly as regards the Geneva conventions, as closely as has the honourable member who has just spoken; if anyone were to come close, it would be the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), who I notice is to speak later in this debate on the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The premise on which the major hesitations of the honourable member for Kooyong were based is that the fact that we are not entering formal reservations to a number of provisions of the protocols would result in placing in jeopardy those who are directed to serve in conflict. That would be a substantial and reasonable objection if it were true. It is something that I propose to go to in some detail a little later in my speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the honourable member for Kooyong listed the various provisions of the protocols in relation to which he felt the Government ought to enter reservations, I could not help feeling that they would constitute not so much a reservation as an emasculation of the protocols as a sensible contribution to the development of international law. In relation to the proposition that not entering reservations would place in jeopardy those who are directed to serve in conflict, I think that the best judges are those who are the practitioners. That is something to which I propose to return later in my remarks.
       </para>
       <para>
        As my colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has indicated, the purpose of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 is to ratify additional protocols which reaffirm and refine the laws of international armed conflict. Those protocols are in the main a restatement or codification of existing practice, which are designed primarily to strengthen the protection accorded prisoners of war and non-combatants. Their intention is to lessen the horror of war and restrict it to targets of military significance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The development of these protocols has a long history, as honourable members know. During the course of that development, the Government has examined the protocols to ensure that they meet our national interests. In doing so, great weight has been given to their effect on Australia's capacity to conduct military operations both on our own and in partnership with our allies. I need to emphasise that the Government's conclusion, which I stress is based well and truly on advice from the chief of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), is that our national interest is best served by ratifying the protocols. Defence has concluded after a long and careful examination that it will be able to operate effectively within the constraints imposed by the Geneva protocols.
       </para>
       <para>
        The critical provisions as they relate to defence are contained in articles 35 to 58 of protocol I. These articles work to limit the rights of parties to wage war by prohibiting weapons and methods which cause injury or suffering which is unnecessary to the achievement of a military objective. They prohibit attacks on a civilian population unless that population is taking a direct part in hostilities. They also seek to protect civilian sites, especially those of cultural and religious significance, and to preclude reprisals against the civil population.
       </para>
       <para>
        These provisions of the protocols clearly impose obligations on commanders in the field. Those commanders must ensure that their objectives are military rather than civilian and that the means and methods of warfare which they employ minimise the incidental loss of civilian life. They must also protect civilians directly by endeavouring to remove them from proximity to military targets and not to locate such facilities in or near densely populated areas. As previous speakers have pointed out, the topicality and relevance of those provisions to the conduct of the conflict in the Gulf at present could not be greater. Certainly the tactics of Saddam Hussein in wilfully seeking to act in such a way as to frustrate those objectives are to be deplored.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in that connection I mention that wilful breaches of the provisions I have mentioned are characterised as war crimes. Under the terms of this Bill, we, along with other signatories and those who ratify, are obliged and empowered to punish such breaches under the domestic law of this country. It is the opinion of the Government that observance of these principles is necessary not only for the humanitarian conduct of armed conflict, but also for the success of military operations, paradoxical though that may seem. Enormous destruction of lives and civilian infrastructure can harden resolve in war and can undermine peace or the possibility of peace once hostilities cease. By the same token, it is true that it is impossible to conduct a war without some civilian casualties. These provisions seek to minimise such casualties and limit civil damage. The principal obligation on nations and commanders involved in armed conflict is to exercise judgment prudently and in good faith within the spirit of the conventions and protocols, based on information which is reasonably available to them in the field. But such responsibility is not new for senior military personnel.
       </para>
       <para>
        Grave breaches of protocols cannot occur by accident; they require deliberate rejection of available evidence and wilfulness in commission of acts in breach of the protocols. That being so, and given the training, the experience and the professionalism of commanding officers in the Australian Defence Force, the Government simply does not believe that observance of the protocols will inhibit Australia's military personnel from prosecuting warfare as they have in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        The obligations and commitments required by the protocols are consistent with both Australia's defence policies and social values. However, some concern has been expressed that Australia's ability to conduct combined operations with our major allies might be compromised in a situation where we have ratified the protocols, but the ally has not. The ADF is structured, trained and equipped primarily to defend Australian sovereignty, and that, rather than inter-operability, must remain the organising principle of our defence efforts. Inter-operability with our allies in command and control, communications, doctrine, tactics and procedures remains an important goal, but it must always be a goal within the context of national defence requirements and policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any lingering concerns that might have been held over our ability to inter-operate with our allies in the context of observing these protocols have been largely dispelled in recent weeks by the successful integration into the multinational Gulf force of our ships and personnel operating in the Gulf conflict. That ability to inter-operate builds on numerous exercises which we have conducted in the past with the allies that are part of the coalition forces in the Gulf, and that is something that will not be prejudiced in any way by our ratification of the protocols which are implied in this Bill.

        So far 88 states have ratified both Geneva protocols, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) countries of Denmark, Norway, Italy, Iceland, Canada, Greece and Spain. Both the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany have signed the protocols, but have yet to ratify them. The United States and its NATO allies are currently involved in a continuing examination of the protocols to identify common ground in their interpretation. Australia is involved in this process, particularly in discussions with the UK, US, Canadian and New Zealand military officers over the development of military manuals which reflect the laws of armed conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make two points in conclusion. Firstly, Australia's ratification of the protocols will reaffirm our commitment to limiting the scope of war to military objectives and will strengthen the protection afforded to civilians and prisoners of war. It will do so at little cost to the ability of the ADF to operate effectively as an armed force and it therefore deserves the support not just of all honourable members or all Australians, but of all those who want to see greater `civilisation' of this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, I want to repeat what I said earlier: the conclusion that we have come to, as reflected in my remarks, is based squarely on advice from our defence advisers, the Chief of the Defence Force and those in the headquarters of the ADF. That advice is that our national interest is best served by ratifying these protocols and that there is no question that we will be able to continue to operate effectively within the constraints which these protocols impose.

         —I have been pondering for some time why the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill has been brought on for debate as the first item in this session of the Parliament when it has had a fairly leisurely course through the Parliament. It is brought on now at a time when the war in the Persian Gulf is the subject of great interest giving rise to very strong feelings. It seems to me, on reflection, that this is, in substance, the Australian Labor Party's bromide-this is the opportunity for the Labor Party to say, `We are in favour of nice wars where nobody gets killed. We are in favour of wars where our military contribution is one where there is no real, immediate danger to a lot of people; where the war can be conducted and our objectives can be achieved but really our ships are not in immediate danger'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In fact, there seems to be an underlying current running through all of the Government's public statements about the war that this is one where we can get by without too much difficulty. Not only is that so, but also we are now in a situation where the left wing of the parliamentary Labor Party has passed a resolution saying, as I understand it, that it thinks the whole thing should be called off. It is asking for a cease-fire. Over the last few days it has been a mystery to me not only as to how the Government can allow that sort of assertion to go unchallenged, but also as to how the press can omit to discuss the very substantial consequences that must arise from that left-wing resolution being passed.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the ways out that the Government has adopted is to promote this piece of legislation, yet again, at this time to show that it is in favour of one of the nice things, the sort of war it believes can be conducted-namely, a war where civilians are protected. This, of course, is a nonsense argument and we know that civilians unfortunately are the casualties of war. None of us wants to see that situation continue and we have to have a sensible but practical approach to the problem of civilian casualties in war-one which will protect civilians as far as possible; one which is consistent with international law but one which, at the same time, does not excessively restrict the ability, flexibility and effectiveness of our armed forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say a few things about the protocol, partly by questioning the way in which the Australian Government believes it will operate and, indeed, by way of asking what various clauses in the protocol actually mean. By way of an introduction, I make these preliminary points. Firstly, a number of provisions in the protocol are quite unexceptionable. All the desirable provisions relating to journalists and prisoners and the general provisions designed to protect the sick, wounded and injured are such that one would not, if one were a reasonable person, have any exception to them whatsoever. Indeed, they would be applied, and will be applied, by us and by other civilised countries with which we like to associate whether or not this protocol becomes part of the law. The United States will not deliberately and intentionally inflict casualties on civilians in this war. Nor will we. The United States does not have to subscribe to this protocol to bring about that result. Most of those provisions will be applied in practice by countries such as the United States, Great Britain and Australia even if this protocol never becomes law. That is the first thing that must be said about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second thing that must be said is that some of the provisions of the protocol, as I interpret them, will severely restrict the effectiveness of our fighting forces and, indeed, may put them at risk. While there is any shadow of doubt as to whether that will happen, we should not proceed with this legislation and implement the protocol. We should not do that until we are absolutely satisfied-and we, on this side of the House are not satisfied yet-that the protocols will not excessively and unreasonably limit the effectiveness of our armed forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        We want to be satisfied that the application of the protocol will not put our armed forces in excessive danger which they would not be subjected to if we were not bound by the protocol. At present that is not a situation we can say has been achieved. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was of this view himself at one stage when, in his letter to former President Reagan, he said that there were a number of `ambiguities and operational complexities'. We are not satisfied that that problem has yet been resolved. If it has been, we want a clear explanation of how it has been resolved. Until we are satisfied about that I, for one, am prepared to apply what the Prime Minister said in his letter-that is, that there are `ambiguities and operational complexities' in the terms of the protocol. We are not satisfied at the moment and we need to be satisfied before we will support this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of further explanation and illustration of this matter, I will make three additional points. For the purpose of this exercise I want to assume that, in the context of the present conflict in the Persian Gulf, Iraq, the United States of America and, for that matter, Australia have adopted the protocol and are applying it. We know that that is not the case, but the only sensible way of testing how this protocol will work in practice is by assuming that belligerent parties are in fact bound by it. So let us proceed on the assumption that in fact Iraq, the United States and Australia have adopted the protocol and are bound by it. If that is the case, how, in the present conflict, will article 52, paragraphs 2 and 3 be applied? Article 52, paragraph 2 says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is more in the clause than that, of course, but that is the opening, and substantial, proposition contained in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question then arises: what happens if there is doubt as to whether the target that it is proposed to attack is in fact a military or a civilian objective? In answering that question one has to remember that the obligation under the protocol-and I repeat it-is that attacks shall be limited, not generally to military objectives, but `strictly'. We must make the additional point before proceeding that if one enters into international agreements of this sort they must be complied with literally and strictly. It is pointless and quite dishonest to enter into them-to agree that one will be bound by them-and then to say, `We will play it pretty loosely at the edges and no-one will expect us to implement the terms of the convention strictly'. That is not a principle that Australia should comply with and if we are going to enter into this protocol and be bound by it we must adhere to its terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bearing that in mind, the first troublesome part is the provision that says that attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. Having laid that foundation, I ask the question: what happens if there is doubt as to whether in the heat of battle and the immediacy of the situation we have to decide whether our target is a military objective or a civilian objective? That exact same question has arisen in this current conflict. We know that Iraq has sought to protect some of its military installations and its military equipment by masquerading them as civilian objectives and civilian structures. It puts the artillery piece into a mosque; it puts the Scud launcher into a mosque or into a school or a civilian area, like a closely settled suburb. Then, of course, it would say, if it were bound by this convention presumably, that that is still a school, it is still a house, it is still a mosque and surely it is a civilian target.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the query that arises if we are going to be honest and are going to apply this convention strictly, honestly and properly. The protocol gives us the answer to that question; it gives us the answer to that quandary. I believe that it is that answer which creates the very danger, as things stand at the moment, of adhering to the protocol. The answer is contained in paragraph 3. It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the protocol itself gives us the answer that if in doubt we are not allowed to assume that it is part of the military infrastructure and, therefore, under paragraph 2 we are strictly not allowed to attack it. In other words, if we want to apply this protocol honestly, we would be in a situation where the civilian structure could not be attacked.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we apply it again to the situation in the Persian Gulf war, Iraq would be free to continue to launch Scud missiles-against civilian targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia, I might add-from sites that are masquerading as civilian structures. Surely that is quite absurd and utterly ludicrous. Not only is it ludicrous but also if the United States, bound by this convention, were on the other side of that situation, it would be putting its own military forces at risk. It would be imposing excessive limitations, restrictions and inflexibility on its own armed forces and would not be able to do the job that it is there to do. That seems on the surface, in the absence of any explanation from the Government, to be one reason by itself as to why we need further elucidation on the terms of this protocol before we can honestly and genuinely support it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second provision that gives me concern is article 56. Paragraph 1 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generation stations, shall not be made the object of attack.
       </para>
       <para>
        We ask the question: in all circumstances? We are given the answer, `Yes, virtually in all circumstances'. The same paragraph goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . even where these objects are military objectives . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Even where those objects are military objectives, we may not attack dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations. We may ask: in all circumstances? Well, we are given a clue to that.

         —The honourable member says that I should read on. What it does not say, of course, is, `if such an attack will cause the release of dangerous substances or dangerous forces'. Rather it says, `if such an attack may result in that'. That is not just a legalism or a hairsplitting exercise. I again come to the point that if we are going to enter into the protocol we must do it in the spirit that we are going to comply with the terms of it. That provision is telling us that we may not attack those installations even where they are military objectives-so we are limited in our military exercise from the very outset-if the result of it is that we may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I ask the question and hope we will get an answer from the Government: is that not an excessive and unnecessary restriction on one's military flexibility such that one is being excessively hampered in achieving one's military objective?-which is presumably an honourable one, otherwise I hope we would not be there the first place. Is that not the case? I believe that we are entitled to an answer from the Government. Article 56 goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations-
       </para>
       <para>
        they being the dams, dykes or nuclear generating stations-
       </para>
       <para>
        shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces . . . and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we cannot even attack military objectives which are located at or nearby those installations, not only in those cases where if we do it, it is definitely going to cause severe loss to the civilian population, but if it may. We would maintain on the present understanding we have that that is an unfair and severe restriction on one's military capability such that one is not achieving one's military objective, which is supposed to be an honourable one anyway, and such that in addition to that one is putting one's own military personnel at risk. That is something that we are not prepared to do in the absence of a rational and sensible explanation from the Government. It would mean, again to apply it to the present conflict, that bound by this protocol the United States would have to say, `We're sorry, we can't attack that Scud missile launcher which is launching missiles onto civilian targets in Israel because the Scud missile launcher is parked on a dam or parked near a dam. If we hit the missile launcher we might hit the dam'.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no need for the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) to cover himself in such despair because the Government is promoting the protocol that says that if that may be the consequence we are not allowed to attack the dam and we are not allowed to attack the other military objective either which, in the example I have given, is the Scud missile launcher. Surely that is devoid of commonsense. In the absence of further rational explanation that persuades us, we will not support it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third thing I want to say is that the Prime Minister and Senator Robert Ray in their press interviews over the last few days have spoken, in my view sensibly, about civilian casualties in this war. The other day Senator Ray said:
       </para>
       <para>
        What I said, and I didn't say they were avoiding civilian targets, I said they were not targeting civilians. A slight subtlety of difference that you might be able to pick up there is oil refineries quite clearly are military targets whether civilians work there or not. I have no belief that they should be isolated in some way. I mean these things are difficult. They're not in plain black and white. The attacks on oil tankers going down roads seem almost against civilians but the fact is that almost certainly the Iraqi's are putting their scud missile launchers in between those to try to disguise them. They are, and we should never underestimate, reasonably sophisticated military strategists in some areas, especially in deception.
       </para>
       <para>
        Both the Prime Minister and Senator Ray have said consistently in line with proper and legitimate military practice principles that of course we avoid civilian casualties if we can, but there will be civilian casualties when our enemy seeks to hide his military objectives amongst civilian structures and amongst civilians. I maintain that the Prime Minister and Senator Ray were absolutely right in what they said. But I maintain that what they said would be wrong under this protocol. Before this debate concludes, I ask the Government: is it not the case that under the protocol what the Prime Minister has described could not occur?

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may know, I spent a considerable time before I entered this House teaching international relations in various universities. A key component of international relations is the study of war. One of the most common observations about the study of war in international relations is that the regulations of peace are contained in a slim volume, and the regulations of war are contained in a thick volume. This is no paradox. It is precisely during war that the regulation of conflict and the conduct of international relations are most broken down. It is at that time that they are in most need of buttressing. Hence, most commentators believe it appropriate that most attention be paid to regulating international affairs when they are at their most barbaric and anarchic, that is, during war.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The regulation of warfare has concerned jurists since Grotius, the modern founder of international law. In essence, these regulations recognise the legitimate use of war as an instrument of state policy but seek to control both its outbreak and its conduct with reference to just means for its pursuit and prosecution. In this century various international conventions have been formulated to regulate the prosecution of war, most famously the various Geneva conventions-particularly those of 1925 and 1949.
       </para>
       <para>
        These conventions are not just empty shells. They have produced a wide range of regulatory activities, including the almost universal avoidance of the use of poison gas-with the notable exception of Iraq-since the First World War, and the successful prosecution of Japanese war criminals for waging aggressive war and of Germans for waging crimes against humanity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1949 Geneva Convention has been in place during a period of general peace and absence of world war. Nonetheless, about 160 local wars have been waged during those 40-odd years, and during those wars between 25 million and 30 million people have been killed. These wars have ranged in character from anti-colonial rebellions through civil wars and revolutions to classic set piece interstate wars of the kind that Iran and Iraq fought for eight years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In some respects these limited wars are more easy to regulate by the actions of the members of the international community, most of whom are not involved in these limited wars. I believe that the framing of regulatory regimes for such limited wars is a most urgent task for the international community and should be continually developed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is within this context that the additions to the 1949 Geneva Convention that are brought here today for ratification should be most urgently attended to. They involve protocol I, relating to the protection of the victims of international armed conflicts, and the accompanying protocol II, which relates to non-international conflicts. I appreciate that any such additions to the regulation of war cannot be unconditionally accepted without examination since they may provide legal discrimination in favour of some class or character of parties to conflict as against others and thereby afford unintentional military advantage to one side or another.
       </para>
       <para>
        These particular protocols relate to prisoners of war and to civilians in particular-two categories of persons who are of great interest to all of us at a time when bombing of areas inhabited by civilians is being undertaken by both sides in the Gulf war and when prisoners of war are also being taken and held by both sides. If we look back to the 160-odd limited wars I referred to previously, we will see that civilians and prisoners of war have suffered often during these conflicts.
       </para>
       <para>
        These particulars protocols were developed over a long period at the initiation of the International Red Cross. The final text of the protocols resulted from a number of sessions held in Geneva in the mid-1970s, concluding in 1977. It should be noted that many nations, including our own in 1978-when the present Opposition was in power-signed the protocols. Over 90 states have now ratified Protocol I, and 87 states have ratified Protocol II. We recommend that Australia join this very large number of states which seem to have suffered no outbreak of the Black Death as a result of ratifying them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such ratification will not cost anything for Australia financially. Essentially it extends the legal regulatory regime with respect to war. In particular, it calls for required punishment for those who barbarously ill-treat prisoners of war or refugees and for those who indiscriminately attack and impose undue and excessive loss of life on civilian populations. The relevance of both issues to the present war in the Gulf should be apparent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians might in turn ask why ratification of these urgent protocols has taken so long to come before the House. The essential reason relates to the reluctance of the United States Government during the Reagan years, for reasons I will return to, to adhere to these protocols and this Australian Government's hope that the United States could be persuaded to change its mind in this respect and that we could then go in with our great and powerful friend.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989, following the election of Reagan's successor, President Bush, it became clear that the United States' view would be maintained and that substantially the same position would be adopted by President Bush. The Bill was therefore first introduced into this House in 1989. The election last year interrupted its passage. This Government is now determined to go ahead with the ratification, the United States' position notwithstanding.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had hoped that this ratification could be afforded bipartisan support, particularly in view of the Opposition's previous support for these protocols, and particularly in view of the shadow Minister concerned being the initial Australian signatory to the protocols. I genuinely regret, and with no crocodile tears here, that the Opposition has been unwilling or unable by its own lights to take this course. I respect much of the reasoning put forward by that side in the debate so far. But I think this is another issue on which this Government is going to have to disagree with its great and powerful friend and its otherwise firm ally, the United States, and get on with ratification and the improvement of the regulatory regime as it concerns the conduct of war, particularly in respect of innocent civilians and prisoners taken during the war.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United States' rejection of protocol I was expressed clearly in the then President's letter to the United States Senate in January 1987. Essentially it revolved around the contention that the new rules applying to struggles for self-determination `elevates the international legal status of self-described national liberation groups that make a practice of terrorism'. This Government does not believe that this is the case but views the protocol as applying to, as laid out in article 1.4, `peoples fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations'.
       </para>
       <para>
        This application, then, is quite specific and is limited to these kinds of struggles. It applies to both sides of the conflict when such struggles break out. In other words, we believe that it cannot be applied to terrorist organisations, properly defined, for reasons I will return to. I suppose that it might be conceded in a political way that the attitude of the Australian Labor Party and the Republican United States administrations of the last 12 years have somewhat differed from time to time in regard to the nature of national liberation movements and terrorist organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to subscribe to the rather facile dictum, `One person's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist'. But I do appreciate that the political considerations often make it very difficult to lay down clear legal guidelines for what comprises a terrorist organisation, which often sees itself of course as having political and, therefore, strategic and international legal objectives. Historical differences between the US Republican Administration and this Government over, for example, the African National Congress in South Africa make this clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that this protocol, in the clause to which I have referred and elsewhere, seeks to take steps to distinguish between terrorist and political liberation organisations. This is not easy but it clearly distinguishes between someone who is fighting for political democracy in a repressive situation, involving racist repression for example, and a fanatic who blows up airlines in his spare time for either cash or fun.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second American objection in that letter was that the protocol would grant competent status to `irregular forces even if they do not satisfy the traditional requirements to distinguish themselves from the civilian population'. Again, we believe this interpretation to be erroneous, particularly since protocol I is applicable only to international armed conflicts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the United States voiced some military reservations which were, I must concede-for a non-legal mind such as my own-rather difficult to follow but which appeared to relate to the fear of enhancing the international status of terrorist organisations. We should note that the American objections do not reflect majority international opinion, but are nonetheless cause for consideration by close allies such as Australia, and I concede this point readily to the Opposition. If it were the case that our ratification of these protocols, and the United States' rejection, significantly inhibited joint military actions with the United States, or inhibited what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has referred to as inter-operability, then our Government would have cause for pause, and I again readily concede that-not necessarily for rejection, but of cause for pause.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, we have been conducting recent exercises in conjunction with American forces, notably the Kangaroo exercises, under protocol standards, and the United States forces have had no difficulty in complying with our activities. In any case, it should be noted, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel himself pointed out, that more than half of these countries that are operational in the Gulf War United Nations sponsored program to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces have in fact already ratified these protocols and appear to have no difficulty operating alongside United States forces. As the Minister has pointed out, our own forces have already advised him of the fact that it would involve them in no significant hindrances.

        The list of countries-which I have not the time here to itemise-which have both ratified these protocols and are operating in conjunction with American forces is hardly surprising because the Americans themselves are in fact operating under the conditions laid down by these protocols without ratifying them, because they have other objections, to which I have already referred, bearing on the kind of force, the kind of political organisation that these protocols would recognise. In so far as the Gulf operations are concerned, the Americans are scrupulously adhering to the protocol determinations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The protocols are designed to protect civilian populations to the extent consistent with the pursuit of legitimate military objectives. This makes the aerial bombardment of civilian targets alone illegal. Iraq has been attacking precisely such targets, in Israel and in Saudi Arabia in particular, whereas the coalition forces have only attacked military targets. If civilian facilities are used to aid military objectives-that is, by hiding tanks or artillery or Scud missiles in the way that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. BROWN) itemised-the status of those civilian targets changes. The status of civilian forces becomes quite different and they come under the aegis of military operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is why the nature of the bombing raids undertaken in the Gulf by the different sides is so important, and it is so important that the coalition bombing of military targets be demonstrated as coming within both international law in general and these protocols in particular. B52 bombing of the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait and adjacent areas is completely legal. Similarly, the precision bombing of military targets-say, Scud missile launchers in civilian areas, say, Baghdad or Basra-is similarly legal. Collateral damage to civilian centres around such military targets remains legal while they are just that-that is, collateral-and their scope comprises a proportionate level relative to the military purpose for which they are employed. The video evidence of the accuracy of the smart bomb raids are necessary proof of legality, and even if we look at the Iraqi claims of the level of civilian casualties incurred in these bombings, it can be seen that this is quite insufficient to go anywhere near demonstrating an illegality in nature of the smart bomb precision bombing which has been undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        In complete contrast to this, Iraq has undertaken indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas quite unrelated to the military conflict and with no military purpose-involving Saudi Arabia-and of cities of a state that is not even a party to the conflict-that is, Israel. In addition, it has used prisoners of war for propaganda purposes, and not only tortured them, but exhibited them on international television to show that it has tortured them. It has also used weapons that have long been declared illegal, including poison gas. It has sought to attack civilian populations by destroying their natural environment and water supply by pumping the world record size oil slick down the Gulf. Finally, it has explicitly stated its intention to use international terrorist organisations to inflict maximum damage on civilian targets totally unrelated and in no collateral way connected with the military conflict itself in the Gulf area.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all these respects Iraq is waging a war illegally, and we regret that the United States has not brought its great weight to bear behind protocol I in order to enhance the authority of protocol I in order to further enhance the illegality of Iraq's actions. The United States has nothing to lose in this respect since it is scrupulously adhering to the legality of its pursuit and conduct of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        The protocols require that military leadership assess whether any collateral civilian damage is thereby incurred, and whether it is proportionate to the military advantage to be won. I take the shadow Attorney-General's point that this may sometimes inconvenience military commanders in the field. My response to that, I am sorry to say, is one of being slightly aghast. The whole purpose of the regulatory regime when it is applied to war is to constrain the pursuit of war by unlimited means. It is precisely to ask military commanders to take into cognisance the level of civilisation that we have achieved, the unfortunate level of destructive capability that is achieved simultaneously, and the need to restrict military destructive capabilities in accordance with our prevailing civilisation norms. To the extent that this is inconvenient to military commanders, we may regret it, but I feel that this is a step on the road to progress and the establishment of a more just means of pursuit and prosecution of warfare. I note with great affection that the military in Australia has expressed its satisfaction with our adherence to these protocols, a further step towards the civilisation to which we all aspire.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that we are debating these protocols at a time when Australia is in effect at war, and at war together with a major ally, the United States, which has reservations about these protocols. That is unfortunate, but as I have been at pains to demonstrate-and as the Government is sure is the case-this will not inhibit our joint operations with the United States now or in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second Opposition speaker had some other objections to make towards the ratification of these protocols, the central one of which I took to be around the nature of article 52. He raised some other articles, but let me just concentrate on article 52 as the central representation of the point he was making. The point was that this inhibits our capability of self-defence and the military defence of our nation by confusing the nature of civilian and military targets, and enabling a rogue state such as Iraq to hide military targets behind a civilian fence, which then makes them unattackable, and puts us at a physical disadvantage. If this were the case, I would have my own reservations about these protocols as a person who has taught at Duntroon Military College, as it was then known, and at the Joint Services Staff College at Weston Creek-and my good wishes to all those officers who are still there. But article 52 does nothing of the kind. Article 52 defines civilian objects by reference to military objectives, and what it says, for example, is this: should a house, normally a civilian dwelling, be destroyed simply because it is there? The answer is no. But if it provides shelter for military action such as by hiding a command post, a bunker, a tank, or even an observation post, or a Scud missile, then it changes in character and ceases to be solely a civilian facility, and now has a military character and becomes subject to the kind of military operations that other military facilities would be subject to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, let me summarise where I believe we are at. Protocol I further inhibits the use of force in war by placing additional limits on states' legal behaviour with respect to civilians, refugees and prisoners of war. The United States has objected to the extension of the rules to include entities it fears may include terrorist organisations. We on the Government side of the House disagree with this interpretation. We also note that in almost all other respects the United States in fact goes out of its way to comply with the code of military conduct embodied in these protocols. As a result, inter-operability- or joint actions involving US and Australian forces-has not been and will not be inhibited by these protocols. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has gone to great lengths to explain this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, it is precisely the rogue-style states which we are likely to get in conflict with, like Iraq, which are most in need of regulation by such Geneva conventions and their protocols; and if a new international order is to replace the Cold War of the last four decades, it is precisely such regimes that must be regulated by the international community coming up with more and more strictly enforceable rules concerning the conduct of conflict by such rogue states. We may have certain reservations about the precise nature of these protocols, but the fact is they are a step down the road of civilising the international community, and they deserve our support. It is against this background of the desirability of expanding these rules governing the conduct of conflict and war in the international community that I urge members to support this Bill.

         —It is with considerable sadness that I rise to oppose the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990. Anybody who has been close to a war situation is revolted by what he has experienced. Therefore, the broad thrust of this Bill, its desire to bring more relief to the suffering of innocent civilians in times of war, is to be commended.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are, of course, several honourable members of this House who have extensive and distinguished active military service. It seems to be the practice of this place to state one's credentials up front. My own experience was 24 years service in the Royal Air Force. My exposure to active service included time in Singapore and Malaysia prior to those countries achieving their independence and during the Malaysian emergency, and three years in Cyprus during part of that country's inter-communal and often anti-British strife.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, there are many Australians outside of this place who have a very distinguished and more extensive service record than I do. So I do not set myself up as an expert. However, having had some exposure, I felt that it was incumbent upon somebody in this place to speak on behalf of those who actually have to go out into the field and fight on behalf of their fellow countrymen.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regrettably, there are too many lawyers and other armchair experts who sit in offices and deal in hypothetical situations. In short, I wish to talk about the realities of operating in an actual war situation. I have great sympathy for the views expressed by honourable members who support the Bill. However, I echo the sentiments of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) when he says, in effect, that good intentions can sometimes be more dangerous than sound, practical application.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, honourable members should be aware that there are large parts of this Bill that are just impractical. It would be grossly unfair to inflict such limitations on our own armed forces. My principal objections are: the total impracticality of applying much of what is being proposed in a war situation; the likely inadvertent breach by Australian servicemen of this convention when operating alongside friendly forces whose country may not have ratified the convention-we are not talking about inter-operability; we are talking about a question of law-and, finally, the incredible lack of everyday, practical, commonsense provisions of the Bill, whereby the hands of Australian forces in the field, and of their commanders in particular, will be tied in a totally unacceptable way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should like to look at some of the particular provisions of the Bill. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) dealt somewhat graphically with article 52 and with article 56, so I will not repeat all of that. However, I should like to move to article 57. Paragraph 2(A) (III) says that those who plan or decide upon an attack shall refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to say that an attack should be cancelled or suspended if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a military one, or is subject to special protection, or the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, et cetera. It then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.
       </para>
       <para>
        What this means, when assessing whether it would be lawful to attack ammunition depots and defence research and development establishments, seems very clear to me. I believe it would probably always be unlawful under this convention because those who are seeking to prove it is lawful will always, of course, have the onus cast upon them. The only way it can be done would be to prove that a dangerous substance had not escaped and no civilians in the area could possibly be affected. If such an installation was located in the middle of the Sahara Desert, that might be possible. But in a country with a large population, or a high population density, that would be almost impossible. The Australian Department of Defence joint working party stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Merchant seamen are civilians and as a merchant ship is prima facie at least a civilian object, the article does impose some restraints on the conduct of naval operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would suggest that that is a masterpiece of understatement. It is obvious that the effect of the protocol will be to make it unlawful to attack the means of production, storage and distribution of war materials, and this will change fundamentally the way that modern war is waged. Presumably that is the object of the exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, the other side may not be equally gentlemanly. What this is saying to our Australian armed forces-should the Government ratify this convention-is that if there are civilians within a bull's roar of a legitimate military target, which our forces may well not even know about at the time, they cannot attack that legitimate military target. This is because subsequently they may be found to have breached the over-narrow definition of the convention. Article 59 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is prohibited for the parties to the conflict to attack, by any means whatsoever, non defended localities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such a non-defended locality should fulfil the following conditions: all combatants as well as mobile weapons and mobile military equipment must have been evacuated; no hostile use shall be made of fixed military installations or establishments; no acts of hostility shall be committed by the authorities or by the population; and no activities in support of military operations shall be undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask these questions: who is to know what is there? Who is to know what is non-defended? Who is to know that the other side is playing the gentleman's game and being honest? I suggest that this makes absolute nonsense of the whole strategy of war which this country, God forbid, needs from time to time to wage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the point that war is not an attractive thing, as we are seeing in the Gulf conflict today. But for hundreds of years wars have been fought out often without the civilian population back home being aware of the reality, the brutality and the suffering. Television has meant that wars are now replayed every night in our lounge rooms courtesy of Cable News Network (CNN). People are naturally and properly horrified by what they are now seeing. However, I believe that the fact that it is now common knowledge in the lounge rooms does not change the actuality of the battle front. The reality of war is that no-one can go into any active service situation using half measures. If someone is going to fight, he must fight to win, otherwise he should not waste his time or the lives of his troops, because all he will do is cause more suffering and prolong the agony for all concerned on both sides.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me move to article 82-legal advisers in the armed forces-and I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        They shall ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to advise military commanders at the appropriate level, on the application of the conventions of this protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on the subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        A commander's responsibilities, may I remind the House, extend to troops ordinarily under his command, also to troops under his operational control for a particular operation and for a limited period of time, and even sometimes to civilians or other persons under his control. Legal advisers, the convention proposes, must be made available to the commanders in time of armed conflict to advise on the application of the conventions and the protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        In practice, I believe that commanders will experience great difficulty with the protocol because it fails to list or describe their duties and responsibilities in any practical way. They will find it essential to seek legal advice on operational plans, and on operations during execution both to ensure that there is no overt breach of the protocol and as a desirable precaution in preparation for the inevitable post-mortems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The viability of this process of consultation, for example, during the heat of battle or when communications are poor is, I would suggest, open to question. The number of legal advisers is limited, and it is unlikely that they can be made available during battle conditions to all levels of commanders who may require assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a young man of 19 years I was in Singapore in a local insurgency situation. We sometimes went out on riot duty. When we did this, we formed a riot square-a body of men with armed troops on the front and down the side and across the back to protect us from people shooting and throwing things and all the rest of it. In the middle we had a `tape man' who ran out a couple of hundred yards in front of the riot square and rolled a tape across the road and then nipped back smartly. Then two `banner men' with large poles unfurled a banner in multiple languages that said to the people who were shooting and firing at us, `Don't cross the tape, or we will fire'. The truth of the matter is that if we did not have any magistrate along and the commander was able to take action at a reasonably early stage, we minimised any casualties. If we had a legal man along, the tendency was that we would wait and we would wait and we would wait. That, of course, meant that the local crowd would get more and more agitated. They would get more and more bold in what they were doing and then, ultimately, their violence would become much worse. Then when the magistrate finally gave the commander permission to take some action, a far greater degree of force was required to restore order, and this usually resulted in far more casualties being incurred on both sides.

         —Just before the dinner break, I related an example from my own experience in Singapore of having a magistrate in tow. Invariably when that magistrate was present, his delaying and his hesitation resulted in the need for a greater use of force than in a normal situation.

       <para>
        To continue where I broke off, I point out that some years later I was also involved in a subsequent experience as an officer in Cyprus during civil unrest and community disturbances. I was in command of troops who had been issued with live ammunition that they were not allowed to load. When threatened by an intruder or rioter they had to formally challenge three times before they were even allowed to put that ammunition `up the spout', as the local phrase was; in other words, to load. The view amongst most of the troops was that the only time one would actually be allowed to defend oneself was after one had been shot.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were occasions when servicemen were court-martialled for having used live ammunition without giving the required number of warnings, even when there had been no casualties. They had acted out of a pure sense of self-preservation. In reality if you impose unreasonable conditions on commanders and troops in the field they are likely to ignore them because they are in peril of their lives. Afterwards, of course, all sorts of alleged activities change in the cold light of day with the benefit of hindsight, with the benefit of self-justification or for the benefit of political purposes. If it is a matter of recognition of troops, for example, arm bands can be added to a body to prove that they were separately identified, or removed from a body to prove that they were not separately identified.

        Who is to say-especially when reporting after the event-that action taken in the heat of the moment was right or wrong or reasonable or not reasonable?

       </para>
       <para>
        The drafters of the protocol have attempted to widen its application. In their attempts to satisfy the goal of giving increased protection to the civilian population and at the same time to stop future military infringements on human liberties, the protocol has tended to raise more questions than it has been able to resolve successfully. This places great burdens on the field commander whose job it will be to interpret, apply and justify his actions in accordance with the protocol guidelines in the day-to-day operational setting.
       </para>
       <para>
        From article 57(2) it can be seen that the protection of civilians is of paramount importance. In affording this increased security the drafters of the protocol, intentionally or not, have made more complex the job of those whose responsibility it will be to implement and abide by the document. The previous speaker alluded to this and said that if it were more difficult for them, unfortunately, that had to be. I believe that the wording employed allows wide and, at times, varying interpretations of the inferred standard. This is just not acceptable for commanders in the field. What is meant, for example, by the phrase `have done everything feasible'? What are `all feasible precautions'? What is `excessive'?

        Finally, I would like to make the point that it is all well and good to say that a majority of nations of the world have subscribed to this convention, but the reality is that most of the leading nations of the world-those who actually have to keep the peace-have not subscribed and they have not done so for some very good reasons. As I started by saying, the intent of this Bill is excellent and it is with genuine regret that I feel compelled to speak against it. However, above all, we must look after the interests, well-being and rights of our own forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is out of touch with the realities of a war situation. It does not protect Australian soldiers when operating alongside friendly forces who are not signatories to the protocol. It assumes the other side will play by the rules and that, I can assure you, does not happen in war. It ties our own forces' hands in an active service situation and, therefore, will break down in practice on the field of battle.

         —What a tragic irony it is today that we stand debating the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill, a measure almost universally approved by the international community, at a time when this nation's forces are engaged in armed conflict alongside allied powers the majority of which are not yet signatories to this convention. It is a tragedy because there might be some properly expressed interests by the Iraqis on this particular issue-the question of civilian injury. Almost every other argument that is advanced by the Iraqis, in my view, is palpably implausible, monstrously in error and generally hypocritical. However, in relation to the question of civilian casualties, I think we have an issue of substance to deal with.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very important that we are today discussing our accession to a protocol which would deal with our responsibility internationally in this area. It is also an irony that the Opposition is speaking against the accession to this protocol against a background of Australia being one of the initial sponsors under the then leadership of Prime Minister Fraser. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the then foreign Minister, was a prominent sponsor of this very protocol which now comes before the House. This protocol did not emerge from a body in which Australia played no part and had no participation. It emerged from a dialogue between nations in which the then Australian foreign Minister, now shadow Attorney-General and formerly Leader of the Opposition, was Australia's voice in sponsoring and endorsing this particular measure. It is also against a background where Australia's own armed forces, in advice to this Government, say that none of the spurious arguments raised by the Opposition have merit. The advice formally tendered to our Government in relation to this matter is that nothing in this protocol binds the hands of the Australian armed forces in any manner which is prejudicial to the conduct of their proper role in the defence of this country, or in terms of the carriage of their responsibilities with allied forces. Indeed, the terms of engagement which have been set by this Government in the Gulf crisis recognise and in practice support already compliance with the terms of this protocol. So the Australian forces engaged in hostilities at the moment are already bound by the terms of engagement to the formal requirements of this protocol.

        What is it in the Geneva convention that can possibly raise the ire of any person who has any commitment whatsoever to basic humanitarianism and an understanding of our responsibilities to our fellow men, even at times when we are in armed conflict with them? If one turns to the key elements of the Geneva convention-the first protocol-there are two major provisions which define what are called grave breaches. Under clause 5 of the Bill, grave breaches are the provisions which become justiciable, which can come before an Australian court, as war crimes in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        What can become war crimes? Firstly, if one turns to section 11, it is a war crime to inflict on any person in the care of hostile forces physical mutilation, medical or scientific experiments or removal of tissue organs for transplantation. Is it claimed in any way that any civilised nation would engage in those practices and that we could condone it? Article 85 (3) defines further `grave breaches'. They include acts which:
       </para>

       <para>

        in other words, coming on to the battle field and using those symbols to disguise some military objectives. Neither Australia nor any other civilised nation would resort to those measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is said that it is possible that some other foe not signatory to this convention might resort to such measures, and certainly that is the case. If one looks at this convention, many aspects of it already have been breached-for example, in the case of the present hostilities by Iraq. Many instances of that have been demonstrated. But does that excuse us from implementing warfare in a manner which is contrary entirely to the edicts of a civilised world and does that excuse us from accepting any responsibility for the conduct of our armed forces? It is said again in terms of argumentation that because the United States and Great Britain are not signatories yet to this convention, in some way we are excused from the exercise of our own moral judgment and moral responsibility. Plainly, that exudes a different form of morality than that of which I am cognisant. One cannot excuse one's own inability to conceive of and to stand by international standards of which all nations ought to have cognisance by saying others stand outside that regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        If ever one had a platitudinous statement of why the United States has not yet ratified or acceded to the convention, one would only need to listen to the explanation given by the former President of the United States on 29 January 1987 where he urged the Senate not to ratify this protocol because the Department of State was of the view that the protocol would undermine humanitarian law and endanger civilians at war. Anyone reading this convention, anyone having a jot of independent judgment, would reject that as platitudinous nonsense. It is plainly untrue.
       </para>
       <para>
        We, in terms of our responsibilities, should not be craven and set aside and simply accept what others might so hypocritically and foolishly advance. Rather, we should use the councils that we do have. We should use the standing we do have now with our allies and our friends, to say to them, `Nothing stands in the way of your accession to this convention'. That is the reality because, in practice, the United States observes those practical constraints which form this convention. Daily we see the representatives of the United States stand before the television cameras and inform us of the very strict protections and controls they have instituted on their own attacks on military targets in Iraq with the object of making certain that civilian targets are not even accidentally struck. In addition to that, we are told of the very strict rules they have to prevent the destruction of cultural objects-mosques and the like.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true, as the allied forces have conceded and must concede, that in any conflict there is the possibility of collateral damage, of innocent civilians being hit and affected-and that is a tragedy of all conflict. But for us to not follow through on this and say that the Australian Government repudiates utterly a policy which would allow it to inflict force on the civilian population by way of policy is simply wrong. Unfortunately, this convention arose out of a very real set of facts. It arose out of World War II. It arose out of a series of anti-colonial guerilla wars also, where civilian targets were abused.
       </para>
       <para>
        World War II, for example, is replete with examples where the Germans firstly sought to bring Britain to its knees by indiscriminate attacks on cities such as London and Coventry. Then the allies, who generally approach warfare in a manner consistent with the Geneva Conventions, made one of the great mistakes of World War II-the bombing of Dresden. The bombing of Dresden was a tragedy for which Churchill and the allied war leaders are properly condemned. Even in the circumstances of that great conflict, that we can now look back and say that the destruction of Dresden was an act of infamy is a tribute to our own ability to reject from our own arsenal of war those measures which are no longer appropriate to civilised conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some, I suppose, who might say that when warfare reigns, it is open slather-there are no constraints; it is the lowest common denominator. They say, `Whatever the implements of war-gas, torture, indiscriminate destruction of civilians-it is all the same; go for it'. That has not been the course of development in terms of thinking in the community of nations. It is one which we would wish to put behind us. War is a horrible enough experience as it is. Increasingly, our technology of destruction is becoming so potent that many, many thousands of persons in uniform will be exposed to extreme danger even by unseen enemies. The capacity for massive destruction of civilian targets, if that is attempted, exists on a scale never before known to this world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only form of restraint that the international community has to prevent us from descending into barbarism is self-restraint-self-restraint imposed by a collective acknowledgment that there are some basic principles which override our own national interest in the short term. So we come to an acceptance that, even in a time of war, we impose on ourselves some kind of limits. I reject entirely the argument that if it is convenient to disregard those limits, if it is simple to disregard those limits, those limits should be so disregarded. It is not an argument capable of being so resolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two important elements to the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill which are worthy of comment. Firstly, as I said, clause 5 makes criminal as war crimes punishable in this country those grave breaches of the protocol which I have read. There are also provisions which are very important in terms of standards for the protection of personnel who are captured. There are provisions which relate to the protections and entitlements of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other organisations of that nature. There are also provisions relating to the protection of prisoners of war. Importantly, in that regard, there is a provision which allows a person in detention in this country to apply to the Federal Court for a declaration that he is subject to those provisions as a prisoner of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I conclude, I might mention other provisions of a more general nature which are not set out as are those under articles 11 and 85, which define grave breaches of the protocol, but are equally important in setting out rules which we would now regard as important for all nations to adhere to.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, section III provides for rules for nations to notify others in relation to missing and dead persons, something that arose in the Vietnam conflict where the North Vietnamese kept back information in relation to missing US soldiers, causing grave distress to their relatives and friends. This convention sets down as a rule of international law that a country which knows of the names of missing and dead personnel has an obligation to pass them on to relatives in the country of the hostile party and to return at a time when it is appropriate the remains of those deceased, if that is practicable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also sets out provisions for dealing with prisoners of war. Finally, article 35.3, very importantly in the context of the present hostilities in the Gulf, sets out a provision of international law, saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet these very provisions are not acceded to not only by Iraq, but also by the United Nations, Great Britain and, until now, Australia. I find it absolutely hypocritical and reprehensible that people who can stand up and condemn Iraq for those kinds of actions can then turn around, sit on the opposite side of this House and refuse to accede to an international convention which prohibits such actions. It seems to me to be hypocrisy of the grossest and most outstanding kind that I have had the misfortune to hear in this House. I conclude my remarks with those observations.

I also acknowledge that I agree with the majority of the points that he raised while speaking to this House. One of the problems of this debate is that we have some reservations. If the Government were to support those reservations, we would have a changed position with respect to the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill.

        I have listened to a number of people with academic and legal backgrounds speaking on certain aspects of the Bill. I have listened to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) speak of the support that he has from the Chief of the General Staff and from the Australian Defence Force chiefs, but I must say that the comments that rang closest to home for me were those made by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) because he was looking at the issues on the ground, the sort of issues that I intend to look at this evening in light of my military background and experience. I believe that they are the issues that are critical to this whole exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the real problems is that it is very easy for people to put down simple solutions on a piece of paper while sitting behind a desk having a cup of coffee, but it is a darned sight different trying to put down on a piece of paper the way to deal with these situations if one is being shot at. I listened to the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) talk about the clear distinction between houses where civilians lived and obvious locations where the enemy would be and where enemy products, ordnance, would be stored. That is very clear while sitting behind a desk or standing up speaking in a place such as this, but it is a damned sight different trying to differentiate between those locations when one is out on the ground being shot at.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is really what we are on about in this debate. Let us get away from the legalistic and academic terms of those who would like to see wars and other such types of activities placed into a very clinical situation. Quite frankly, I agree with the propositions that are being put. It would be great to put people into those situations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In thinking of this, I am reminded of the young lieutenant in the United States who was court martialled because of the actions that his troop took in a Vietnamese village. I certainly do not condone any of those actions, and I am sure that nobody would. But the fact of the matter is that we are talking about young lieutenants in their early 20s with soldiers of around the same age who are going to have responsibilities for units in front line fighting-conflict situations-who are going to have to make split second decisions about the survival of their forces, the soldiers that they have around them, and about where they are going to move their troops on the ground. On top of that, we are going to ask them to make decisions about whether a house has only civilians in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that we have to get back to the realities of this issue. I question whether a lot of these aspects affecting front line soldiers are being thought through. Let me just refer to the schedule to the Bill. Article 39.1 reads as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 39.2 reads as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is great academic stuff, but when we get down to the reality of it, in how many conflicts have people changed uniforms? In how many conflicts have people gone into a situation in civilian clothing? On how many occasions may we require our special forces to wear civilian clothing firstly to protect their identity and secondly for their safety. I do not know, but the situation could well arise where we would need our special forces to go in wearing civilian clothing, knowing that they were going to carry out military actions. As I read this, such actions would become illegal and prohibited. I defy anybody to say that that is not the case from a reading of the article. Article 44.3 reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to promote the protection of the civilian population from the effects of hostilities, combatants are obliged to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack. Recognising, however, that there are situations in armed conflict where, owing to the nature of the hostilities an armed combatant cannot so distinguish himself, he shall retain his status as a combatant, provided that, in such situations, he carries his arms openly:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) during each military engagement, and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) during such time as he is visible to the adversary while he is engaged in a military deployment preceding the launching of an attack in which he is to participate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Really, it is legal, academic jargon. Military people out in the field are expected to wave their arms around so that they can be seen. Quite frankly, the whole exercise is just laughable when we get down to talking about the nuts and bolts of it, the military soldiers on the ground in the front line. Let me refer to a further article. Article 51.4 reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In a military situation, bearing in mind that one is being fired on, how is one going to distinguish between specific military objectives? I would suggest that one cannot. The Government is proposing that we sign these protocols. If we sign the protocols, we will in fact honour all the clauses of the protocols. If we do not, it is pointless going through the process of signing them. I just wonder what the Government's answer is.

Having been involved in a military conflict, I do consider myself wise enough, in going through these articles, to have major reservations about whether they should be supported.

        We have said that we will support the Bill provided those reservations are put in place. The Government is not prepared to do that. I believe that, as somebody who has served in an infantry battalion and been in conflicts of the nature described in these protocols, I would have difficulty in assessing the difference between civilian houses and enemy houses. It is not easy to say that. It is also not very easy to say that, if one goes into a house where there are civilians, the right thing has been done. It is not easy to go through that process. But unless they have been in a situation where they have been hyped up and shot at, I defy anybody to be able to make a judgment in that situation.

I will also make some reference to the contribution made by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson).

        It seems to me that it is not a question of saying that we want a reservation. After all, we are representing humanity. It is not an issue that can be discussed within the realms basically of the legal confines of this place. What sort of human beings are we that we cannot come together and agree that there are some limits to the way in which we will operate in a theatre of war? That is what this is about.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am a little confused because it was, after all, the Opposition that brought this matter on in the first instance when it was in government. It is now taking a number of points which I believe to be in every respect factuous. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Isaacs for the way in which he put his argument. No doubt he did it with great sincerity, and I pay tribute to him for that. However, I do not agree with him, because it seems to me that the logical conclusion of what he was saying is that the chief of the Defence Force does not know what he is doing. If he respects the hierarchy of the defence forces, as I do-and he said that he did-then it seems to me that he would have to say that the hierarchy has taken account of what it believed to be the best interests of its troops.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is sitting at the table, said, the chief of the Defence Force has essentially said that it is in Australia's interests to sign these protocols-that is important-along with 88 other countries at this time. Are all those other countries barbaric? Are all those nations taking a position where they do not understand the nuances involved in these protocols? I am sure they do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst I have a great deal of respect for the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and, indeed, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. BROWN), the arguments that they put this afternoon in this place had the same hollow ring about them. For example, the honourable member for Kooyong made a number of statements saying that these protocols may place too many impediments upon our armed forces and even endanger them. I find that odd. Is the honourable member for Kooyong saying that the chief of the Defence Force, someone who is charged with the responsibility of advising this Government as well as commanding the defence forces at that level, is not in a position to make a judgment about what is and what is not appropriate for the defence forces? He said that he was reluctant to give the Bill his bipartisan support and enumerated a number of clauses within the protocols. He said that he had some problem with articles 35, 42, 44, 48, 49, 53 and 56. No-one is doubting the difficulty in implementing these protocols. That is not the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kooyong also stated that observance of the protocols would prohibit the defence forces from prosecuting wars as they have in the past. If we prosecute wars as we have in the past, I do not believe that is appropriate. If we must have war, I would have thought that the best thing we can do for the civilians we represent and the civilians who, unfortunately, in the present instance, live in Iraq is to agree on some basic and fundamental principles on how to wage those conflicts. It is not unreasonable, I would have thought, for reasonable people-people with at least some fundamental belief in the goodness of humankind-to come to some agreement. There may well be difficulty in implementing some of these things, but that does not mean they should not be tried, nor does it mean we should not give assent to these protocols. It is worth noting that what we are doing is providing a declaration of understanding.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no need for reservations. If we have reservations, why would we want to even endorse the protocols? We would not want to endorse them, because we would think they were wrong. By a reservation, we are essentially saying that we do not think we have an appropriate instrument. There is no point in having reservations. People either agree with the protocol or do not agree with it. The honourable member for Kooyong came into this place and made the point that he believes reservations would be appropriate. The honourable member for Menzies came in here and said that he believes we should have these reservations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my mind, there is a fundamental dishonesty in that approach. As I say, it may be difficult to implement this protocol, but it is important that we at least try. I concur with the honourable member for Denison, who expressed his concern not only that Iraq is flouting these principles but also that the chief protagonists amongst the allies have not endorsed the protocols. That is a concern. I think the allies ought to endorse them. If there is any moral persuasion that we as a community can use to suggest to them that they ought to do it, we should use it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not have these conflicts because we want war. It is in our own best interests, the interests of people on both sides of conflicts, to ensure that, at least as far as is possible, they are conducted in such a way as to protect the innocent. I have no truck at all with the way in which Saddam Hussein has used civilians. I condemn that sort of action and the way in which Saddam Hussein has put missiles into Israel without any thought of attacking military installations. That is not on. But the fact that he does it does not mean we have to do it, nor does it mean we should contemplate doing it. By this sort of protocol, we should be showing the world community that we are intent on disciplining ourselves and we should be trying to insist that those with whom we are allies have the same sort of discipline when they approach war.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to point to a couple of things mentioned in the contribution of the honourable member for Menzies. He claimed that protocol I, article 52, the general protection of civilian objects, would prevent a military attack on anything other than a military objective. Clearly he has not read, or does not understand, the full context of this protocol. Of course it is the intention of the protocol to stop attacks on civilian locations such as churches and the like. In the case of real doubt, the protocol requires the military to hold back until the doubt is erased. But the honourable member for Menzies has failed to take note of article 51 and I ask him to read it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the honourable member for Menzies has raised the question of whether, under article 56, military forces will be unable to attack a dam even if the dam is acting as protection for a Scud launcher nearby. Again he ought to read the protocol carefully rather than mouthing that sort of rhetoric. I suggest that he read particularly 56(2) (a). This section continues on to address other concerns expressed by the honourable member for Menzies. Contrary to what the honourable member for Menzies says, the protocol does not limit the military's ability to wage war. He and his colleagues may want us to believe that, but it does not. It seeks, rather, to offer the maximum protection in the horrifying event that people are caught in a war.

        The basic principles of the Geneva Convention have been expressed in the Australian on 1 February 1991 and can be summed up as follows: the human dignity of all individuals must be respected at all times and everything possible must be done, without any kind of discrimination, to reduce the suffering of those who take no direct part in the conflict or have been put out of action through sickness, wounds or captivity. What is fundamentally wrong with that objective? Why would people have a reservation about that objective and the protocol to endorse it?
       </para>
       <para>
        I applaud the honourable member for Isaacs for the way in which he presented his argument, but he is wrong. I would ask him to study the history of the Geneva conventions. Why might people want to control the excesses of war? As we go into the twenty-first century, with all the artillery and technology which is now available for humankind to wage war, it is important, in my view, that we ought to have some controls, we ought to exercise those controls, and we ought to recognise that technology of itself may be harmful, that the fundamental principle of our jobs in this Parliament is the preservation of human life and that we should take every possible step to ensure that we do everything to preserve the lives not only of Australians but of other people in the world community. If that means providing some constraints on the way in which we operate in the military theatre, then so be it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I accept the difficulties that may confront the soldier in the firing line. I understand that. But we are not talking about such aspects of the argument; we are talking about minutia such as the instructions people are given to wage war and how they understand the rules within which they will wage conflicts. If 88 other nations can come to an agreement and we endorse it, it would seem to me not inappropriate to expect other people to endorse it also. At the end of the day, as we well know, there is nothing to stop any nation which is a signatory to any of these conventions ignoring them completely. Saddam Hussein has done it and he is to be condemned for it. But I reject the argument that we should then turn around and say that, because he has been able to do it, we should be able to do it; that would be not only simplistic but naive.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth recalling that the first Geneva Convention was drafted as early as 1864. In time the Geneva Convention has been built upon by additional conventions covering different aspects of protection and humanitarian assistance. The immense value of the work undertaken by the Red Cross and Red Crescent should not be underestimated or understated. Amidst the horrors of world wars, regional conflicts, civil wars and disasters, they have done the caring for the wounded and the imprisoned. They should be applauded for that work and they should be supported. It should come as no surprise that the Red Cross is one of the major sponsoring organisations for this convention, because in its work in the battlefield it sees the sorts of horrors perpetrated by war-not only on civilians, but on people who are charged with the responsibility of fighting these conflicts and who are in uniform, whether as combatants or as prisoners of war. We have an absurd proposition where this megalomaniac in Iraq has, it seems, used prisoners of war as targets. In other cases, he has provided civilian targets. Nothing can express the horror of that situation, but it does not mean that we should act likewise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to refer briefly to protocol II which we will also be endorsing, but which does not require an Act of this Parliament. The introduction to article 1 of this protocol states that it:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . shall apply to all armed conflicts which are not covered by Article 1 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) and which take place in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organised armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is also important to read from article 4, subsection 2, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the following acts against the persons referred to in paragraph 1 are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) collective punishments;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) taking of hostages;
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) acts of terrorism;
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault;
       </para>
       <para>
        (f) slavery and the slave trade in all their forms;
       </para>
       <para>
        (g) pillage;
       </para>
       <para>
        (h) threats to commit any of the foregoing acts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, there is a particular section which deals exclusively with children. I bring those to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I think they are important. We have seen a number of insurgency movements operating in the world since 1945 where these rules have not applied. In the post-war period we have seen the putting down of what, in other circumstances, one might call insurgents-the revolutionary or popular movements and liberation movements in various nations around the world. In many of those instances we have seen the most horrific abuse of civilians-of the citizens of countries-who have been subjected to the worst excesses inflicted by military means. As an example, we need only look at the outrageous way in which this person, who promotes himself as the would-be spokesman for the Middle East, treated the Kurdish people. How can anyone contemplate such barbarity?
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not have to go too far north of Australia to see where this has taken place in recent times. I know that we cannot do anything about these events of history. However, it is of grave concern to me, if one takes into account what this protocol is supposed to do, what it identifies and how it expresses concern about the way in which we should protect civilians and people in other nation states who might be involved in some conflict with their government, that there is nothing we can physically do about it or that we have chosen not to do anything about it. In the case of Iraq, there has been a clear transgression of international law and the occupation of another country. But what happened when the Kurds were being despoiled? Very little. What happened when 200,000 Timorese out of a population of some 700,000 were lost post-1975? What did we do? What action did we take to try to stop that excessive barbarity? It seems to me that we need to take account of where we are. Whilst I appreciate and understand the intent of honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Isaacs, I reject totally the propositions put forward by the Opposition and I implore the House to endorse these recommendations.

         —I listened with some interest to the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). He asked a very poignant question: `What sort of human beings are we?'. I guess that many speakers in this debate on the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 and in the earlier debate on the Gulf war have tried to come to grips with that particular question. I say to the honourable member and to those people who are listening that I do not know what sort of human beings we are when today we find ourselves in a world where we are tearing ourselves apart. I wish I did know the answer to that question; I wish I did know what has brought us, as a human race, to this point again and again over the centuries. Yet here we are again. I suppose the question that has been posed really is the $64,000 one. I wish we could say in some way that come 1991 we are, as a human race, somewhat civilised but, sadly, clearly we are not.

        I was disappointed to hear in the speech of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) earlier this evening the assertion or belief which was repeated by the honourable member for the Northern Territory that the hierarchy of the Defence Force has agreed with the sentiments of this protocol. If in fact it has-and at this point I do not accept that it has-I believe that it is severely deluded in having done so. I can only assume-and I say this advisedly-that it is toeing the Government line in doing so and I am very disappointed.

        We recently witnessed the rather unusual spectacle in this House of two days of debate-20 hours of debate with 113 members speaking-on the proposition that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put to the House which effectively committed Australians to war. In that debate there was an unusual degree of bipartisan support for that proposition. It is interesting to see the contrast which has come out in this debate tonight and earlier this afternoon. On an issue which is of a similar vein in terms of subject matter, we find ourselves, once again, poles apart. Why is that? I believe we are simply divided on this issue on the point of whether we can effectively engage in war and comply with this protocol. I believe that we, on this side of the House, have conscientiously come to the point of view that without appropriate reservations the answer to that question is that we cannot commit Australians to war and be bound by this protocol for a number of reasons, which I will deal with in a moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for the Northern Territory has the whole thing back to front when he makes the point that it is not a question of being able to do what Saddam Hussein has done. Rather, we ought to turn it around and say that we should recognise that regardless of what he has done we, unfortunately, will find ourselves in a position where people like him will do what they want to do regardless of what civilised or decent people determine to do at a time of war or in any other circumstance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight we are dealing with the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990. The protocol that we are dealing with supplements the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. I point out that in many respects what I will say has already been said, but I want to say it as well. This protocol has failed to gain the support of the world's major military nations-many of which are our allies. Earlier this afternoon the Minister read out a list of those countries which had ratified, or had indicated their intention to ratify, the protocol. The list was lacking in terms of the support of the major members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), for example. There are many good reasons for this which I will go into in a moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say to the Government and to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, that even if the protocol were free of the questionable legalities and ambiguities, which every speaker on our side has pointed to, in a philosophical sense the sad fact remains that nothing about war is really manageable at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier this afternoon the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) quoted Dwight Eisenhower, a famous general and American President. Maybe I could add to that by reminding people that Dwight Eisenhower also said that nothing about war should amaze us-in other words, we should never be surprised by what happens in war.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a pity it is that tonight we cannot discuss legislation to actually ban war. It seems to me supremely ironic that in law we accept the proposition that a nation can wage war but it can do so only in a certain way. The naivety of the Government on this particular issue really is astounding. Effectively, I believe that the Minister and the Government would be prepared to see Australians sent to war, in terms of this protocol, with one hand tied behind their back.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to the Minister and to the Government that if we are reaching a point in history where we are really civilised, perhaps they would support a convention that requires that only rubber bullets be fired in war. Perhaps that would be being really progressive. But what meaning would it have? Perhaps the left wing of the Australian Labor Party in particular-I see that one of its prominent members will speak after me and I shall listen with interest to what he has to say-would support such a proposition unilaterally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps we could go back to the ancient history of Israel and find a solution there-that is, select one soldier from each side to fight the battle and determine the outcome accordingly. I am not suggesting in any way other than lightly that perhaps if we put President Bush and Saddam Hussein together and let them fight it out we could determine a result with much less loss of life. Of course, the Philistines thought they had a winner with Goliath. David turned out to be something of a surprise package. Sadly, that idea of lining the armies up and facing each other across the valley and sending forth one warrior to sort it all out from each side would not work today.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of civilised war-and that is, to some extent, what we are talking about here-is appealing, although I am quite certain, like my colleague the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), that it is rather idealistic. It assumes that people who wage war are civilised. Of course, that has never been the case. I suppose we might say that in a lot of wars one side was civilised and the other was uncivilised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that everything should be done that can be done to prevent war. That is notwithstanding human nature, the human nature that the honourable member for the Northern Territory talked about. It is staggering to think that so far this century 100 million people have been killed in wars. And we still have 10 years to go.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aims of the Geneva conventions in protecting the victims of war, the sick, wounded or shipwrecked combatants, prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians are without doubt noble and worthy. But it is debatable exactly what effect the Geneva conventions have actually had to date. This particular matter has been raised time and again in this debate. Yet, here we are discussing an additional protocol when already the outlined principles of the 1949 conventions have only been selectively adhered to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Decent civilised people in war should be able to distinguish between right and wrong. However, the lessons of the past have taught us that an unscrupulous enemy has no regard for the rules when it is waging war. In recent years we have heard graphic accounts of the Japanese mistreating and executing prisoners of war in World War II.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many times during this debate we have alluded to the Gulf war in which we are now engaged as yet another frightening example of how the laws of international conflict can be entirely flaunted even by those who are parties to the Geneva conventions. For example, let me remind the House once again that Iraq, in its invasion of Kuwait, has shown no regard for the fourth Geneva convention which aims to provide protection for civilians, in particular those who are in a territory occupied by another country's armed forces. Rather, in contrast, instead of providing protection to the citizens of Kuwait, as we found in Amnesty International's December report, Iraqi forces have actually tortured, raped, injured and killed civilians in Kuwait since it invaded that country on 2 August.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me remind the House that delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross have visited nine prisoners of war and 61 civilian internees held by the allied forces. However, attempts to visit POWs held by Iraqi armed forces have so far been unsuccessful. Saddam Hussein seems to think of himself as exempt from Geneva conventions, because it suits him to do so, and from international law. He has gone even further. He stooped to the depths of parading obviously beaten prisoners of war on television, which is clearly in breach of article 13 of the third convention which provides against acts of violence or intimidation and insults of public curiosity. Further, his threat to use prisoners of war as human shields is also in distinct breach of article 23, which provides that POWs cannot be detained in areas exposed to fighting or used to render certain points or areas immune from military operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Saddam Hussein goes even further in his threat to use chemical weapons again, as he has done in the past. It is interesting that one of the earlier speakers tonight told us in effect how well the conventions had worked. As I listened to him outlining some of the wars in which gas had not been used, it occurred to me that there were some notable exceptions. The use by Saddam Hussein of gas and his threat to do so again which would conflict with the Geneva gas protocol of 1925 was certainly one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the potential of our adversary in this war, or in any conflict, simply to pay lip service to the Geneva conventions and any additional protocols is enormous. Unfortunately, it is more than that. It is really a reality of war. Article 35 of the protocol that we have been discussing today and into this evening states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is prohibited to employ methods . . . of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Can anyone really stand in this House today and say that he honestly believes that had this protocol been effective in the Gulf war situation, that article would have prevented Saddam Hussein from creating the deliberate oil spill? Of course not. In discussing the additional protocol to the Geneva conventions, we are simply creating more rules that essentially are one-sided and unenforceable. They are-in a sense, I understand where the Government is coming from here-noble ideals, albeit expressed fairly vaguely. But they are on the surface superficially appealing. There are various implications of protocol I that are clearly impractical and, most importantly, from the point of view of members on this side, not in the best interests of our nation. Article 82 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Parties to the conflict . . . shall ensure that legal advisers are available . . . to advise military commanders at the appropriate level on the application of the Conventions and this Protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on this subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Isaacs has already alluded to the quite ridiculous implications of this for troops actually going into battle. It is really quite an absurd suggestion that lawyers, of all people, should be on hand at the front line to give advice to military commanders on how to conduct a war. Anyone who has even been remotely close to the action would realise the pressures that are on military commanders at that time. I would have thought that the last thing that they would want to do would be to seek legal advice. One can only imagine the cries of `Before we attack, I must consult my lawyer'. What article 82 does in essence is create more work for lawyers who have already managed to complicate life unnecessarily for most of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Incidentally the protocol, which was finalised 14 years ago, in 1977, is a lawyer's dream. I can almost picture a courtroom debate on article 35 on the prohibition of warfare of a nature to cause `superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering'. How can we possibly define those terms in any meaningful way? It reminds me of a story told in the last war of the deserter who, when charged, said that he was merely retreating while the others were advancing. What do words mean in this situation? Article 50, which defines how to determine who a civilian is, is totally inappropriate, as has been pointed out many times, in the case of guerilla warfare. It means, in effect, that enemy soldiers can quite feasibly be hidden by the civilian population or that they can seek sanctuary in a school, church or house and be virtually untouchable. Article 48 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have hoped that the Government would have recognised by now that all of these are clearly unworkable and would make life extremely difficult, if not impossible, for troops when it actually came to going into action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United States and other allied forces in the current action have attempted to minimise what they, I suppose rather euphemistically, call collateral damage. But I believe that great credit can be paid to them for the attempts that they have made and the great lengths that they have gone to to target only military and strategic installations. However, what respect for common decency has Saddam Hussein shown by indiscriminately launching Scud missiles at Israel when Israel at this stage is not even a party to the conflict? Even if Israel were, such action contravenes the fourth Geneva conventions which prohibits indiscriminate bombing and which states that one of the underlying principles of the laws of international conflict is that civilians should be spared. It is a sad fact however that in modern wars nine out of ten people killed are civilians.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that this protocol, while it may have created a warm inner glow for those involved in drafting it-and I assume that warm inner glow is shared by Government members who have supported it-it serves no real purpose and, more importantly, it creates great problems for us as a nation in the event of our going to war. One of my main concerns is that many of our partners in both the NATO and ANZUS-Australia, New Zealand and United States-alliances have expressed serious concerns about the protocol and have refused to ratify it. Most notably, the United States takes the view that it is `fundamentally and irreconcilably flawed', and that `a number of the provisions of the protocol are militarily unacceptable'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it should be considered that the United States, whilst not infallible in its judgment, is one of our closest military allies. That presents us with some very real difficulties. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself has conceded in a letter to President Reagan-I think this has already been referred to-that the protocol contains a number of ambiguities and operational complexities. However, the Government is going headlong into the ratification of this protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us hear the Government members yet to speak in this debate talk about preventing war. By all means, let us do that. Let us not kid ourselves about war. Let us not pretend we can fight a war with one hand tied behind our backs.

         —In response to the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I thought that the debate we had in this chamber two weeks ago indicated that honourable members on all sides of the House would seek to avoid war and would do everything in their power to prevent war breaking out. I am pleased that the Government has brought on for debate the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill. I am somewhat surprised that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) in his contribution should have expressed surprise at the debate taking place. I would have thought it was pretty obvious why the debate should take place at this time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am particularly pleased, being neither a lawyer nor someone who has served in the military forces, except for the national service I did many years ago, to have the opportunity to make a small contribution to the debate. As honourable members who read the Notice Paper would be aware, for some time I have had on notice a series of questions on the Geneva conventions. Indeed, the latest question, dealing with the ratification of this protocol, was raised during the special sitting of the House on 21 January 1991. I did that because I felt at the time it was imperative that Australia ratify the protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have listened to the arguments of the last couple of speakers for the Opposition as to why Australia should not ratify and, interestingly, their arguments as to why Australia should not ratify are precisely the arguments used by me and other members on this side as to why Australia should. Really, I do not think there is a lot of dispute between both sides. It is unfortunate that the Opposition cannot support the Government on this measure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, recent events in the Gulf make Australia's ratification even more important. As has been pointed out, protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflict. It is also most appropriate for Australia to ratify protocol I because from 1 January 1991 Australia has commenced a three-year term as a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. If Australia is to be fully effective and credible as a member of the Commission the Government must take the remaining steps available to it under the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the fundamental international instrument on human rights. If Australia expects to be allowed to scrutinise human rights in other countries it must conclude the ratifications and declarations which will allow other countries to scrutinise human rights in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Geneva Conventions the protocols needed ratification by 20 international governments before a fact-finding commission could be appointed under article 90. This commission is intended to investigate various breaches. Twenty governments have now ratified the protocols, the latest being Canada in November 1990. To date, New Zealand is the only government in the Asia-Pacific region to do so. I believe that nothing is more important than having the two Houses of this Parliament give this matter speedy passage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ratifying protocol I could enable the Government to make a declaration of protection of victims of war and nominate a representative for the fact-finding commission. But, as I understand it, the Government at this stage will not be making a declaration under article 90. This declaration by Australia will not only establish the commission but also will give it the basis for an equitable representation of geographical areas sought under paragraph III.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned that the Opposition, which has supported the Government's motion in regard to the Gulf conflict, should now oppose this Bill. It is unfortunate that this could not go through with bipartisan support. I accept that the Opposition has said that it would accept the protocols if Australia stated reservations. I think it was either the Minister then at the table or another Government speaker who said that we either have a Bill or we do not; if we start stating reservations, there will be more reservations than there are clauses to the Bill.

        The honourable member for Kooyong asked me about the Americans, and a lot of Opposition speakers have listed the countries which have not ratified it. It is no surprise that some of the largest military powers, with the exception of China, have not: they are the people I feel who are most likely to be involved. I think all would agree that it is unfortunate that the US has reservations about the protocol. As late as March 1989, I think it was, in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Opposition point of view was quoted:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition believes that the effect of the treaty would be to unacceptably hamstring the co-operation of Australia and US troops while Washington remains opposed to the protocol.

        I put the question again. Canada has a much more significant number of troops in the Gulf than Australia. If the US can work with Canada-and Canada not only ratified it but made the declaration under article 90-if Canada can do that and the US has no problem with that, then if Australia did it, why should this prove to be a problem to the United States?

         —I do not think it would prove a problem for the United States at all. I must say to the Minister at the table, though, that I am very concerned at the projected delay on the declaration. One cannot see why the individual States of Australia have to be consulted on the laws of war at all, or, if it was felt that they had to be consulted, why they have not already been exhaustively consulted. If, for example, the various States were to provide holding areas for prisoners of war, I could well understand the need then for consultation, but it is most unlikely that this will happen. It would be deplorable if our obsession with consulting the States on external affairs leads to Australia missing out on election to the Commission under article 90, and I would ask the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to urge the Attorney-General-indeed, I would urge the Attorney-General myself-to make the declaration under article 90 as soon as possible.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am pleased that the Australian Red Cross has been extensively consulted in the lead up to this. The treatment of prisoners of war has attracted enormous public interest. The third Geneva convention covers the treatment of prisoners of war: a combatant who surrenders or is captured must not be killed or injured and must be treated humanely and with respect for their person and honour. Parading prisoners of war on television and threatening to place them at strategic installations is clearly in breach of article 13 of the third convention, which provides protection for prisoners of war against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity. Many people in Australia have been rightly horrified at the so-called confessions made on television of allied prisoners of war, and the reported threats to detain them at strategic targets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 17 adds that prisoners of war must not be subjected to physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion. Nor can they be detained in areas exposed to the fighting, or used to render certain points or areas immune from military operation, according to article 23.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the convention delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross must be allowed to visit the prisoners of war to check on conditions, to register them, and to facilitate the transmission of personal messages to their families. So far the International Committee of the Red Cross has visited seven Iraqi prisoners of war held by US armed forces, and two prisoners of war and 61 civilian internees held by the British armed forces in the United Kingdom. These were the figures as at last week; the committee may have visited some more since then. Attempts to visit prisoners of war held by the Iraqi armed forces have so far been unsuccessful.
       </para>
       <para>
        The treatment of Kuwaiti citizens under the Iraqi armed forces has been widely publicised, including a report by Amnesty International detailing atrocities. It is reported that Kuwaiti citizens have been tortured, raped, injured and killed. The aim of the fourth Geneva convention is to provide protection of civilians, in particular those civilians who are in a territory occupied by another country's armed forces. Under article 27 those protected persons are entitled to respect for their person and honour, they must be treated humanely, and they must be protected against acts of violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The indiscriminate bombing of any nation is clearly in breach of the fourth Geneva convention. One of the underlying principles of the laws of armed conflict is that civilians should be spared. We have witnessed claims and counter claims regarding the specificity of targets in terms of military objectives in the current conflict. Regardless, civilians should be spared, and any deliberate attack against them is clearly illegal. One honourable member opposite made the point-and I would agree with it, although we may reach a different conclusion about it-that it is a sad fact that in modern wars nine out of 10 people killed are civilians. People say, `Why do we need this to protect civilians?', but they should bear in mind that in modern conflicts nine out of 10 people killed are civilians.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the use of poisonous gases in the current conflict has been threatened. The use of chemical weapons and poisonous gases, or bacteriological warfare, is forbidden by the Geneva gas protocol of 1925. This protocol has been ratified by all countries involved in the Gulf war, and is therefore binding. The laws of armed conflict that should apply to the Gulf war are clearly being breached, and the International Red Cross has regularly reminded all sides of their obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As in other areas of international law, the enforcement of international treaties can prove difficult. There is no provision under the Geneva conventions for an international police force or justice system to enforce the laws. Of course, it is always one of the weaknesses of international law that there is no enforcing body or agency. The responsibility for enforcing them falls on the nations which are party to the Geneva conventions, which provide that people who commit grave breaches must be brought to trial for their offences. The difficulty in bringing members of the armed forces or citizens to trial is that it may be hard to prove the identity of those responsible for the offences, and it may be difficult to bring them to trial in the jurisdiction of their own domestic court system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The immense damage to the environment caused by warfare has caused great concern not only in Australia but also internationally. The 1977 additional protocols to the Geneva conventions, created to update the Geneva conventions, provide for the protection of the environment. Article 35 prohibits the use of methods or means of warfare which can cause long term or severe damage to the environment. The deliberate creation of an oil spill is obviously a breach of this article. It is unfortunate that most of the countries involved in the Gulf war have not ratified the additional protocols, because they are therefore not binding.
       </para>
       <para>
        All thinking people detest war, and of course when armed conflict breaks out it is a failure-a failure of diplomacy, a failure of reason, sometimes a failure of the will to prevent it. To some there is a contradiction in having laws of war, but even in war there must be an accepted behaviour, and a method to monitor that behaviour. By ratification of protocol I, Australia is demonstrating that we will abide by these humanitarian principles.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Labor Government will continue to work tirelessly to achieve world peace. We must, unfortunately, accept that limited wars are likely to continue and take appropriate action, such as is involved in the ratification of the protocols, to promote international adherence to the humanitarian principles embodied in the Geneva conventions and in these protocols.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been stated, one of the arguments in favour of protocol I is the need to provide additional protection for the victims of armed conflict, especially the civilian population of states involved in the conflict. It is also worth making the point that non-ratification of protocol I by Australia would not necessarily remove the uncertainties that some Opposition members have mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also make the point that it is possible and even, I would suggest, likely that parts of protocol I at least will come to be regarded by states, particularly those which are parties to it but also by the International Committee of the Red Cross, as representing customary international law, and therefore will be binding upon non-parties as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        While respecting the arguments put by the Opposition speakers, I am disappointed that they will oppose the legislation. I for my part commend it to the House.

         —It is time that Australia ratified the 1977 protocols. It is a disgrace that the additional protocols are now more than 13 years old and have not been ratified by Australia. It was a disgrace that the Menzies Government ratified the Geneva conventions nine years after they were adopted. Why the delay?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It would seem to most of us, on a reading of the protocols, that they really are motherhood provisions to civilised countries, and yet there is opposition-opposition in Australia that was not forthcoming in 1978 when the protocols were actually signed. Who was Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1978?
       </para>
       <para>
        History has been somewhat distorted, and therefore the background of these proposals needs to be reviewed. The need for the protocols became obvious following the devastation in the Second World War. The protocols were developed by the International Committee of the Red Cross during the 1950s. The Swiss federal council convened a diplomatic conference that held four sessions in Geneva from 1974 to 1977 to negotiate the text to these protocols. More than 100 governments sent legal, defence and diplomatic experts to these conferences and several liberation movements were given observer status at them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia attended all four sessions and played a vital role in the difficult negotiations. Australia was represented by the departments of Attorney-General, Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Australian Red Cross Society. The protocols were adopted by consensus. Australia signed the protocols on 7 December 1978, when the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was Minister for Foreign Affairs. Australian delegations under both the Whitlam and Fraser Governments took an active part in the drafting and adoption of the protocols. It is an appropriate time now for Australia to ratify the proposals. Why? The first reason-it is pretty obvious-is that the Gulf war makes it imperative. It makes it imperative for Australia to pass the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 permitting us to ratify protocol I and to make the declaration under article 90.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is to be an international fact finding commission which will be established when no fewer than 20 states have accepted the competence of the commission pursuant to article 90(2) of protocol I, and in an answer recently in the Parliament it was disclosed that the Swiss department of foreign affairs has advised that Switzerland will convene a conference in June 1991 to constitute the commission. A prompt declaration by Australia will not only help to establish the commission but also give equitable representation on a geographical basis, which is required.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition seems incapable of taking an independent policy stance on any important issue. It appears that the basis of its objection is that the United States of America objects. The statements by the honourable member for Kooyong either represent the greatest conversion since Saul on the road to Damascus or perhaps are explained by the fact that he may have been rolled in the party room. The latter explanation is probably the kindest, because he has not been consistent in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Protocol I makes significant progress in the protection of a civilian population against the effect of hostilities. Article 48 of protocol I codifies, for the first time, the fundamental principle of humanitarian law-that the parties to a conflict shall always distinguish between the civilian population and combatants. It is worth while reading the basic rule of article 48 onto the parliamentary record. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is wrong with that? Is that not what we are being told is happening in the Gulf at the moment, day after day, night after night on Cable Network News (CNN) and other television networks? We are told about the precision bombing that is taking place and how every effort is being made to avoid civilian casualties. That is what these protocols are all about-that is the basic theme that runs through them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of intentional armed conflicts. Protocol II applies to situations of non-international armed conflicts between the armed forces of a party and organised armed groups exercising some territorial control over territory of that party. To treat the rules of humanitarian law separately from the rules as to the means and methods of armed conflict is unrealistic, given the conduct of modern warfare which involves the civilian population to an unprecedented extent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This debate shows the hypocrisy of the Opposition and the Rambo-type attitude that pervades the Opposition arguments that have been put forward in this chamber today. Opposition members are not interested in precision bombing. Misquotes have taken place in relation to the Bill before the House. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) selectively quoted sections of the Bill. Article 52, which embodies the protocols, says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to go back and quote in full article 56 which the honourable member for Menzies quoted because basically the theme running through that article is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives-
       </para>
       <para>
        and here is the qualification, a humanitarian qualification-
       </para>
       <para>
        if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, what is being said is, one would have thought, commonsense. One does not use a sledge-hammer to crack a walnut in times of war. Article 56 states that it is unacceptable for excessive civilian losses to be generated as a result of some strikes and I would have thought that that was commonsense.
       </para>
       <para>
        Are we alone in our ratification of these protocols? Let us put the record straight. Some 164 states around the world, including Australia, are party to the four Geneva conventions of 1949. In relation to the number of states that have ratified or acceded to the protocols additional to the Geneva conventions of 1949, the figures as of 30 November 1990 are 99 in relation to protocol I and 89 in relation to protocol II.
       </para>
       <para>
        One might be surprised to find that amongst the countries that have ratified or have acceded to the protocols are Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria--

It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has shown its concern for the fate of the civilian population in times of war. Australia should now ratify both Protocols and thereby show to its own people, to its neighbours and to the world at large that this country is willing to accept binding obligations of a strictly humanitarian character . . . Rejection of the Protocols by Australia would not be an encouragement to other States of the region, or to potential enemies anywhere, to ratify the Protocols. All governments take into account the attitude of other countries when deciding on ratification of treaties affecting national defence. Furthermore, a treaty will only be accepted by a growing number of States if there is a certain momentum. Nonratification of the Protocols by Australia would certainly reduce that momentum . . . ``Such inaction would encourage States (who may particularly need humanitarian rules) not to ratify the Protocols. Australia's record in world affairs would be needlessly tarnished . . . The Government has introduced the Bill into Parliament. It has thereby expressed its will and determination to ratify both Protocols. If Parliament fails to approve the Bill, Australia would set a deplorable precedent: it would be the first time in history that a Red Cross humanitarian treaty was rejected by Parliament, i.e., a popularly elected body. To enter the Parliament and then to lapse would be an equally shameful world-first.

        Those are not my words; those are the words of the Red Cross. That is its view of the matter. I notice that the honourable member for Kooyong has re-entered the chamber. The point needs to be made again that when the protocol was signed by Australia back in 1978, he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The negotiations that took place spanned the period of the Whitlam and Fraser Governments.

        Really, the Opposition is taking a Rambo-like approach in its opposition to this Bill. I think what it signifies is that there is a gulf between the Government and the Opposition. It also signifies to the peace movement in Australia and around the world and to the general population that, when it comes to running this country and adopting matters of principle, there is a vast difference between the way the Australian Labor Party handles matters and the way the conservative forces handle matters in this country.

        It is a matter of record that the hypocrisy that is being shown by the conservatives in Parliament here today is in stark contrast to what they exhibited some years ago. I repeat: Australia has been an integral part of negotiations on the protocols. It is obscene that it has taken us 13 years to reach this stage. Has Canada, having ratified these proposals, been isolated by the United States? No. Are we to be the lackeys of the United States in this regard? I would submit that we should not be.

        The late Peter Hastings, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, 20 March 1989, recommended ratification of the protocols. Indeed, it was he who confirmed that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, a professional soldier of high repute and the Government's senior military adviser, was advising that the Government should sign the protocol.

         —in reply-I think all members of the House are well aware that this matter has been around for some time. In fact, it was in the Parliament during our previous term of office. I think it is worth reminding those who have taken part in the debate and have displayed an interest in the matter again that the purpose of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 is to amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 so as to enable Australia to ratify protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions. As everyone has discussed tonight, protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. When Australia ratifies protocol I, it will at the same time ratify protocol II which is concerned with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. However, protocol II does not require legislative action to enable its ratification.

         —I think probably that interjection should not be responded to. Today at Question Time I saw people in shirts which looked a lot better than the ones they normally wear. They actually had ties done right up to their collars. Some aspects of this must be extremely disappointing. I know that there was some criticism of the fact that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is not televising Question Time until five to 12 tonight. I must say, as an old supporter of the ABC, that I think it shows a lot of good judgment. But that is not the view of the Speaker, nor can I express a Government view on that matter, may I say.

       <para>
        Quite a few honourable members raised one matter this evening-I heard the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) and I think the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) before him put the point. No-one is questioning the goodwill of the view they have expressed, but I just think they were wrong when they said that the academics and lawyers involved in this exercise do not understand `what is going on on the ground'-I think was how the honourable member for Isaacs termed it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is worth just coming back to the role that the Australian defence forces played in relation to the decision to ratify. The Australian defence forces have been actively involved in the whole process leading to the Australian Government's decision to ratify the protocols. I think the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), as Minister for Foreign Affairs, would be aware that that had been the case when the first conferences were held on this matter. Surely no government would proceed down this track without knowing what its defence force people thought about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian defence forces were involved in an exhaustive study of protocol I which was undertaken after the signing of the protocols back on 7 December 1978-a long while ago. There was a lot of thought given to the matter by, no doubt, the Fraser Government during that period and certainly by this Government. The Australian defence forces were also involved in the review of the operational implications-the matter which I think is causing some concern to honourable members opposite-of ratification undertaken since the announcement of the Government's decision to ratify back in 1986. Both studies have revealed no military or operational bar to the Government proceeding to ratify the protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        This matter was dealt with in more detail earlier today by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and, therefore, I do not propose to spend any more time on it. However, it was a good starting point to indicate that, when one goes back to the studies that were undertaken in December 1978 and, again, the decision that the Government ratified in 1986, there was a very close involvement of the Australian defence forces which have been, as I said, actively involved throughout the whole process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, there is the question of inter-operability which appears, listening to the debate this evening, to be one of the main reasons for the coalition's stance. That seems to be a matter which has caused it a certain amount of difficulty. These difficulties, I think, are caused primarily by the protocol's emphasis on the protection of civilians and civilian objects. However, it must always be borne in mind for those who have those concerns that this emphasis is not at the expense of achieving proper military objectives; there is no intention of that at all. In short, what the protocols require is that there should be no targeting of purely civilian objectives-that is, for example, no carpet bombing of cities. However, civilian targets are not always out of bounds. It is not said anywhere in the protocols that that is the case. If a civilian object is also being used for military objectives, it can be targeted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 52, which was discussed at various times during the debate, defines civilian objects by reference to military objectives and military objectives, in so far as civilian objectives are concerned, are limited to those which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation in the circumstances applying at the particular point in time offer a definite military advantage. Examples of that would be: should a house, normally a civilian dwelling, be destroyed simply because it is there? It may provide shelter if it is captured. If it is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, such as being used as a command post or a bunker, a tank hide or even as an observation post, then, of course, it may become a military object in those circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        An assessment must also be made of the incidental loss of civilian life and of damages to civilian objects other than military objects. That always has to be weighed up against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. That is referred to quite clearly in article 51.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, the protocols do not require no civilian casualties. That is not in the game at all. The protocols do not say that in any clause. The protocols require the military leadership to assess whether or not civilian losses would be in proportion to the military objectives to be achieved by the attack in question. We all know that it is not always easy to get the right balance in these areas-that is accepted-but I think that it is just about being obtained here. It is certainly being done as well as it can be.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) dealt in some detail with the next matter I wish to raise, but it has not been raised so much by the Opposition. It certainly was raised when this topic came before the House back in the period of the Third Hawke Government. I refer to the matter raised I think by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). I will deal more specifically later with the other matters raised by the shadow Attorney-General and honourable member for Kooyong, and the honourable member for Menzies.
       </para>
       <para>
        One matter which concerned the honourable member for Menzies then was, as he said, that no country that had ratified this protocol was instantly identified as being our immediate ally or as being from our region. The honourable member for Banks dealt with that, but I think it is worth reiterating that of the countries that are party to the protocols a number of key Western and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies are party to them, including Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, Greece, Malta, Spain and Luxembourg. Whilst the Holy See is unlikely to be a military ally, it is interesting that it has also ratified the protocol. The point made by the honourable member for Banks is that, in addition to those sorts of countries, Canada and New Zealand are parties. In eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are examples. China is also a party.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the current conflict in the Gulf, it is worth bringing to the attention of all honourable members that of the 29 members of the multinational task force involved, 19 are parties to protocol I and seven have signed both protocols. In the South Pacific and the South East Asian region, Samoa, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Korea, the Solomon Islands, Bangladesh, Laos, Vietnam, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines are other examples of parties to the protocol. So though it may well have been the case at some stage that what the honourable member for Menzies said was true, I think it should be made pretty clear now that it is not the case now.
       </para>
       <para>
        One other matter which was been raised and which I would like to touch on briefly is the claim that problems would be created by military commanders having to have lawyers with them at all times. In the minds of many people, and probably justifiably in some cases, that would create a problem for anyone placed in that position. But that is not the case because the Australian Defence Force's approach to this is that it would have lawyers involved in the planning and preparation of operational materiel and that it would have them available to commanders at strategic levels. In relation to the legal matters involved, that is where they would get their advice.

         —Despite the fact that those opposite make these allegations, when I answer them they think it is amusing. I think it is worthwhile for them to understand that that requirement of the protocol does not represent any difficulty for the Australian defence forces. If it does not represent any difficulty for them, I think Opposition members ought to sleep fairly well tonight and not let it worry them too much because the defence forces are the ones which have to look after the situation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The shadow Attorney-General raised various matters this evening. I must say that I always listen very carefully to what he says. I can pay him the compliment of saying that what he says is always carefully thought out. No doubt he does not come in here and put stupid propositions forward. However, I must say that his speech tonight was one of his less convincing performances-and that is over a period of 10 years. He called for reservations on a number of key articles to the protocol. That was, I think, the main point he made. The Government is not making reservations, as he correctly said, but we may lodge certain declarations of understanding. We are doing this simply because what needs explanation is the meaning of certain provisions, but what we do not want is to resile from the basic principles of the protocol, which would occur if we lodged reservations to all of the articles mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong, particularly in view of their number and scope. They are very wide ranging.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an essential principle of treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organisations that reservations be compatible with the objects and purpose of the treaty. This principle stands whether or not other treaty parties express their disapproval. The number and scope of reservations foreshadowed by the honourable member would in our opinion lead to an emasculation of the protocol. There were just too many proposals put forward in respect of reservations for them to be acceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        He called in particular for a reservation on the prohibition on reprisals contained in the protocol. A reservation on reprisals would not be accepted by some countries. A reservation would operate reciprocally between Australia and a future enemy also party to the protocol. If we did that, it would reduce the level of protection afforded by the protocol to Australian civilians and civilian objects.
       </para>
       <para>
        None of the 99 countries which have become party to the protocol have seen the need to make such a reservation-not one of them. The prohibition on reprisals in the protocol is not a total prohibition. Reprisals are prohibited against civilians, cultural objects and places of worship, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, the environment, dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations containing dangerous forces. The prohibition on reprisals represents an important development in protection of civilians against the horrors of modern warfare.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Menzies has long had an interest in this matter. He was engaged in the debate and would have been shadow Attorney-General when the matter previously came before the House. One of the questions that he raised was how the ambiguities and operational complexities referred to in the letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to President Reagan had been overcome. That can be answered. There are certain ambiguities in the provisions, and this is why the Government intends to lodge declarations at the time of ratification to clarify our understanding of the provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The operational complexities in combined operations which the honourable member for Menzies referred to always exist and do not merely arise by becoming a party to the protocol. They are there anyway. They are constantly addressed by liaison, training, joint exercises and manuals. This will continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then raised another issue, as to how articles 52.2 and 52.3 could be interpreted so as not to put our forces at risk. The simple answer to that is that the protection of civilians and civilian objects in the protocol is not at the expense of achieving legitimate military objectives. I dealt with that in some detail earlier. Such protection is not new. It is fundamental to humanitarian law.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, the protocol requires that there should be no targeting of purely civilian objects. As I mentioned earlier, an example of that is carpet bombing. However, as I said, civilian targets are not always out of bounds from attack, as I discussed a little earlier this evening.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter about which the honourable member for Menzies expressed some concern was whether the language in article 56.1 was not in excess of an unnecessary restriction on our military-a matter which seems to concern many members opposite and, therefore, should be answered. I come back to the point that the protection against the attack on dams, dykes and things like that is not absolute.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Menzies omitted to mention-and the honourable member for Banks dealt with this-article 56.2 which provides for situations where the protection ceases. An example of that is that if a dam is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if an attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support, it may be attacked. That is quite clear if one looks at article 56.2 and not just at article 56.1. The decision to attack clearly involves intelligence, weapons, capability and military assessments being drawn together in much the same way as they have been for centuries.
       </para>
       <para>
        This situation arose in Operation Rolling Thunder conducted by the US forces in Vietnam. Apparently, anti-aircraft weapons were deployed on dyke walls and, if the walls had been breached, severe loss of civilian life would have followed. At the same time, the weapons posed a severe risk to US aircraft attacking their military targets. The decision was then taken to employ a weapons system which destroyed the anti-aircraft guns in placements while leaving the dyke walls intact. That is what happened in a classic case on the ground where this sort of issue had to be faced up to in the tragic war in Vietnam in Operation Rolling Thunder.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is disappointing that we did not get bipartisan support on this matter. I understand that there are concerns opposite, but I hoped that we would have had bipartisan support. But this matter, in my view, has been around for far too long and we had, therefore, to bring the matter forward this evening.

         —We have before the House now the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which is an omnibus Bill making amendments to various Acts that relate to crime and the administration of the criminal justice system. The Bill contains amendments to a number of Acts, including the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, the Crimes Act 1914, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973, the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In addition to those amendments, part 9 and schedule 2 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill make amendments to some 18 pieces of Commonwealth legislation. It is fairly late and I will make most of my remarks tomorrow; I simply say by way of introduction that when this piece of legislation comes on for debate at a later day I will be confining my comments to some of the concerns that we have with only two pieces of legislation that are covered by this Bill-namely, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should say at this juncture that we will be supporting the Bill, but we will move amendments to part 3 of the Bill, dealing with the Cash Transaction Reports Act. In these few preliminary remarks before we debate the motion for the adjournment, I want to make it clear that we fully support the objectives of both of these pieces of legislation-namely, the pursuit of the money trail, which the former royal commissioner Frank Costigan, QC, described as the jugular of organised crime. The aims are, firstly, to trace the proceeds of crime and, secondly, to remove the incentive for crime by confiscating the ill-gotten gains of illegal activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent times we have seen a renewed emphasis on the need to pursue the money trail. The Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, has indicated that the Authority will collect, analyse and disseminate intelligence material relating to the money trail. In doing this, the Authority will liaise with various law enforcement bodies, including State police forces, the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Australian Securities Commission and the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. This is a change of direction for the Authority that is most welcome from our point of view and it follows other initiatives that the new Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, is taking in turning the Authority around. One of the primary objectives in establishing the National Crime Authority was to set up a national body that could act as a clearing house for criminal intelligence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I fully acknowledge that both the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act, as invaluable weapons in the fight against organised crime and in the work of Australia as a member of the international financial action task force on money laundering, are to be supported and encouraged. If recent press reports are anything to go by, it would seem that the strategy of pursuing the money trail is having some success in the area of tax evasion and money laundering.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we have real concerns as to whether both these pieces of legislation properly balance the interests of individual liberty against the interests of society as a whole. Those concerns can perhaps best be summed up when one acknowledges that the titles of these two pieces of legislation are in effect misnomers. The operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act is not limited to the proceeds or profits of crime and, by the same token, the ambit of the Cash Transaction Reports Act is not confined to the reporting of cash transactions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to consider the Proceeds of Crime Act. The proposed amendments under part 7 of the Bill will exclude the operation of the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to Australian Capital Territory (ACT) offences. They also contain a number of transitional provisions to cover situations where proceedings under the Act may have been commenced prior to the enactment of the relevant ACT legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Proceeds of Crime Act has been subject to some criticism by the judiciary and the profession. In the relatively short space of time during which the Act has been operative, the courts have had to deal with a large number of disputes relating to its application. When we resume on this matter on another day, I will cite a few of those cases. They will include Saffron v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Brauer v. The Director of Public Prosecutions and, more recently, The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and The Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kunz.

         —For most Australians last Sunday was just another Sunday in February. However, for others who gathered at Huskisson on the New South Wales south coast it was a very special, albeit sombre, day. February 10, 1964 saw one of the worst disasters in the peacetime history of the Royal Australian Navy. I speak of the collision between the destroyer HMAS Voyager and the aircraft carrier and flagship HMAS Melbourne off Jervis Bay, claiming 82 lives. On that fateful night it is now clear that for those involved there was a mixture of understandable fear, of disregard for personal safety, of mutual trust of shipmates, of bravery and, regrettably, of personal sacrifice and death-characteristics we have come to respect and honour in the great and proud traditions of the thousands of men and women who have served in the Australian Naval Service in peace and war, most recently exemplified in the Gulf crisis. Once again I take the opportunity to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the service of their country that evening, to those who survived and continue about their every day lives and, very specially, to their families.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Regrettably, many of those survivors and their families still bear the scars of the tragedy-scars of psychological trauma; of persistent nervous shock; of domestic instability; of financial strain and, importantly in this parliamentary setting, of misplaced confidence in, and neglect by, a Government which espouses social justice but which demonstrably failed in this instance. To demonstrate this failure I refer the House in part to an editorial entitled `Justice at last' which appeared in the Brisbane Courier-Mail on 7 September last year. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The view that the Commonwealth has behaved with despicable bureaucratic self-interest in the Voyager case would result in very little argument in the general community. The High Court ruling . . . paving the way for compensation claims by the survivors of that horrific 1964 naval accident is a signal victory for social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth long denied liability for compensation. Mr Hawke's first government lifted the statute of limitations on the case in 1985, then slammed the door when it found there might be substantial compensation claims in the offing.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        About 80 survivors of the Voyager now are eligible to lodge claims to be compensated for the nightmare that began 26 years ago, among them Queenslander Bernie Verwayen, who spent all his money fighting through to Wednesday's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The ruling means that the Commonwealth as the employer of people paid to defend the country cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if they come to harm in the course of normal duties. This is an important precedent. It is also elementary justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am delighted that Bernie, his wife and Voyager colleagues are in the public gallery at this late hour-yet another example of their great courage and determination. Physically, Bernie suffered only back and stomach injuries, but by 1969 he had been discharged from the Navy as medically unfit, psychological problems being cited. Between 1969 and 1981 he worked for short stints in about 20 different jobs before being declared totally and permanently incapacitated. He has not worked since because of nerve problems and other ailments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also take the opportunity to congratulate Victorian solicitors, Jim Taylor and Mario Viccaro, for their great patience and legal counsel and wish every success to the many other compensation claimants awaiting due legal process. As Bernie Verwayen has said:
       </para>
       <para>
        This has not only been a fight for me but for the other survivors and all who serve our country.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a test case which will be used again and again; that is why it has been so important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I joined the Navy to serve my country and to have a good, long-term career . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        When someone is injured in a normal day-to-day job, they expect some form of compensation. That was all we expected.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that the legal processes are not delayed further and that the dark spectre of the Voyager tragedy can now be replaced by a sense of human dignity and finality.

         —I rise tonight on the adjournment debate to bring up a matter of great concern within my electorate of Prospect. According to the recent Roads and Traffic Authority report, in 1990, 24 people were killed in road accidents within the Fairfield City Council area. Along with Blacktown, this was the highest number of deaths in any local government area in New South Wales during 1990. In 1989 there were some 2,113 crashes on Fairfield roads, 27 fatalities, 211 serious injuries and 1,015 minor injuries. It must be noted that these statistics represent only 25 to 30 per cent of all accidents since the only accidents which were recorded were those reported to police, those which occurred on a public road, those which involved at least one moving vehicle and those which involved at least one person being killed or injured or at least one vehicle being towed away.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Fairfield City Council is in dire need of State and Federal funding to make local roads safer for drivers and pedestrians and it should be up to the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority to ensure that the council receives it. How many more people have to be injured and die in traffic accidents due to roads which are badly in need of upgrading before the State and Federal governments do something about it? According to a recent report by the Fairfield City Council traffic engineer to the council's public works committee, in 1988-89 the Fairfield area had 56 intersections in the top 1,000 black spot intersections-eight of which rated in the top 100 black spot intersections within New South Wales. The report also stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988 the Fairfield Local Government Area recorded the third highest crash frequency for all category of injuries of any Local Government area in New South Wales. In 1989 it recorded the second highest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, in 1990, it has recorded the highest. In view of this the report has recommended that the council should:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . lobby the local members both State and Federal, in an attempt to secure more funding for road safety programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fairfield City Council has estimated that it will now need about $45m to keep up with, and clear, the backlog of road works that must be completed within the area. Of the $90.1m that the Federal Government has allocated to the Greiner Government for local roads for the 1990-91 financial year, Fairfield City Council will receive $662,600, plus $250,000 in retrospective funding for Lawson Street overpass-a bridge, I might add, which was opened in August last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The State Government is providing the council with a total of $2.352m for funding of various local road projects, which includes retrospective funding of $1.257m for the Lawson Street overpass. However, these moneys are a far cry from the $45m the council has estimated it will now need. According to the council report, the Roads and Traffic Authority was:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . seeking a $90,000 commitment from the Federal Government in the 1990-91 Blackspot program-
       </para>
       <para>
        to contribute towards a part time safety officer in council, publicity and promotions in the local area and market research to monitor those promotions. However, the council recently received notice that it was not to be granted this funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Greiner Government has certainly neglected its responsibilities by not allocating sufficient funds to carry out major road construction and improvements within the fastest growing local government area in New South Wales. Unfortunately, it is my constituents and their families who have to find the money to pay for both State and Federal fuel excise with no guarantee that increased local road construction works will be carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another report to the council on the state of our local roads, statistics show that 37 per cent of all fatalities which occurred in the Fairfield local government area in 1989 occurred on one of our most notorious roads, the Horsley Drive. However, of all the funds granted to Fairfield City Council, about $50,000 only will be spent on this road. There is just not enough money to go around. According to that report I have mentioned:
       </para>
       <para>
        Traffic volumes are increasing and are likely to do so in the short to medium term. Funding for the reconstruction and development of the Horsley Drive as a major traffic route has now become critical.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report went on to say that accidents on the Horsley Drive in 1989 alone cost the community an estimated $9.2m in fatalities and injuries. It was even recorded on 8 January in our local paper that the local engineer of Fairfield City Council stated that:
       </para>
       <para>
        Horsley Drive is our number one priority and has been an ongoing concern for the past 25 years. It is our most dangerous road and little more than a cow track.
       </para>
       <para>
        I bring this and other evidence before this Parliament because I believe that the road funding needs to be more adequate. In view of Fairfield City Council's problem, we certainly have to have a bigger share of the funds.

         —On 27 and 28 December last year over 20,000 hectares of grassland, scrub and forest was burnt in my electorate of McEwen in the Strathbogies and around Euroa and district. The damage was horrific, especially occurring at a time when the rural sector is already struggling for survival. The financial cost was considerable. In value of insured property alone it was estimated to be around $3m. Many farmers, already experiencing financial difficulties were underinsured. They will face an even greater battle to restore their properties. Farm homes were destroyed. Wool sheds, dairy sheds and hay sheds were burnt. Thousands of kilometres of fencing were destroyed. It has been difficult to accurately estimate all stock losses but it amounted to approximately 14,000 sheep, hundreds of beef and dairy cattle, horses, goats and other stock and over three quarters of a million bales of hay.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It took 2 1/2 days to bring the fires under control and another four days of close attention. But it was 10 days before anyone could really relax. The fires, especially in the Strathbogie area, were burning in very rugged country. Only a handful of fire fighters knew the terrain but five graders and eight dozers worked in the dark with only hand-held torches to guide them.
       </para>
       <para>
        One hundred and five Country Fire Authority (CFA) tankers from 96 brigades, involving over 1,000 men, gave 15,000 man-hours and fought those fires. It was a superb effort. Volunteers came from the CFA from as far away as Swan Hill, the Department of Conservation and Environment, the Victorian police, State emergency services, the Department of Agriculture, Vic Roads, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross Society, the ambulance service, St John's Ambulance Brigade, and the shires of Euroa, Violet Town, Goulburn, Yea and Mansfield. As well as these people, there were armies of ladies providing meals and moral support. All of these volunteers were tested to the limits of their endurance with little or no rest during those critical 2 1/2 days that it took to bring the fires under control.
       </para>
       <para>
        As well as this superb volunteer effort in fighting the fires, the follow up was just fantastic. Members of local service clubs, private citizens and friends have been helping with the reconstruction of those thousands of kilometres of fencing. Fodder has been donated from all over the State, as well as money for the high cost of petrol and transport to get the fodder to where it was needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The State Disaster Restoration Committee Chairman, John Hill, said that there are three phases after a fire-the heroic, the honeymoon and the disillusion phase. Local Department of Agriculture personnel feel that the disillusion phase has yet to be experienced. All those affected by the fires have been wonderfully supported by their local community but the time is fast approaching when they are going to have to face and make decisions about their survival, given the current rural depression.

       <para>
        I fear that the third phase of disillusion could be long and deeply felt. The sense of pride and commitment in rural areas is still very strong but this Government needs, as a matter of urgency, to let rural communities know that it supports the long term future of rural industries. If this Government would show even a small percentage of the support and commitment shown by the volunteers in fighting those fires, rural residents would feel less uncertain, less fearful and less neglected about their future.

         —Just after 1991 began, Rockhampton, which is the very centre of my electorate, faced a natural disaster when the Fitzroy River was totally flooded. People no doubt saw what was happening because the local television stations gave good coverage to it. But one had to have been there to understand exactly what was occurring. I was speaking to some of the members from this House who flew over the area afterwards and they just could not appreciate the extent of the flooding that took place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to say that to start with and then get to the point of placing on record my personal appreciation for the fantastic effort of so many people, including the State Emergency Service, the special disaster emergency group that was set up under Superintendent Hornhouse, and the hundreds upon hundreds of people from the city council, the Army, the Royal Australian Air Force, the police, and the prisoners. This total community effort demonstrates something of the inner Australian-that when there is trouble people will stick together.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was a time of devastation. It was a time when hundreds of homes were flooded and when thousands of people were dislocated. It was traumatic for so many whose lives were lost, for the old folk who sat and saw their savings washed away and their houses destroyed. Children lost toys and adults lost their cars and their trucks and their businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we need to learn a lesson from this. We need to pay tribute to those who did so much. At the moment the State Government and the city council have come up with a plan for an overall study which will cost $250,000. I am hopeful that the Federal Government will play its part and contribute the $100,000 that is needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to try to find some reasons for all this. This devastation will cost the community around $300m. It has been put to me that we could build a dam at the gap on the Fitzroy that will cost in 1989 terms about $300m. Every day of that flood the total storage of the Sydney Harbour ran past the city of Rockhampton. Honourable members can just imagine what it was all about-the total storage of Sydney Harbor in one day. It is possible that we would be able to somehow head off these difficulties. What happened in 1988 is happening right now. The floods have risen to 7.6 metres. I am suggesting in this House that as a nation we need to use the Fitzroy base as an experiment. The flood plain is one of the biggest in the nation with 71 tributaries flowing into the Fitzroy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that there would be many other places in Australia that could gain not just by a $250,000 study but by a major flood mitigation program, whether it be the establishment of dams, whether it be the construction of levy banks or whatever. It might even mean changing the course of the river in parts but I believe we can learn from it. We really cannot put a figure on the damage to cattle and life.
       </para>
       <para>
        I spoke to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) about the problems that we are going to face for months and months, if not years ahead, trying to fix up bridges and sort out the damaged roads- not just main roads but the arterial and minor roads. There seems to be a need for us to take note of what has taken place and learn from what has occurred and what has been occurring since recorded times for 90-odd years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each time there is a problem the people of Rockhampton and district will come to the fore. There will be those who will show great courage and those who will give their all. There are so many people who have collectively given something like $360,000 to the appeal. There will always be those who will get out there and work. They will man the 24-hour emergency telephone systems, deliver the food to those in need and help with the storage of the furniture that has been shifted.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate that we need, if possible, to learn a lesson. We need to allocate the necessary funds to carry out a national study of the Fitzroy Basin in the hope that we can head off future catastrophes, as this has been, and in the hope that Australia shall learn from the problems that we have been experiencing.

         —I rise to relate to the Parliament a very interesting and valuable experience for me late last year when I accompanied the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to the electorate of Barker where the Minister opened the Woolpunda salt interception scheme. To appreciate the enormity and the importance of this salt interception scheme one almost has to be a South Australian, because South Australians are aware of the dependence of that State on the River Murray. Let us take, for example, the use of water by Adelaide, which in some years has been up to 90 per cent dependent on the River Murray. Of course, quite apart from this urban concentration, we also have the dependence of the rest of South Australia on this water resource, given that reticulation from the River Murray stretches from Keith in the south-east to the Iron Triangle in the north of the State.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, management of the river comes under the Murray-Darling Basin Standing Committee. But my particular interest in this scheme, and the interest I want to bring to the Parliament, lies in the enormous potential for harm to South Australians caused by salination. It is calculated that salination in the River Murray basin in terms of crop loss costs the nation $65m per annum. In damage to industrial fittings, to hot water services and to various urban facilities, the cost to the nation is $37m per annum. For that reason, the control of salinity in the River Murray is all important.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Woolpunda salt interception scheme is quite unique. Most people imagine that salinity in the River Murray is somehow the fault of River Murray irrigators who have used too much water thus causing salination. In the case of the Woolpunda salt interception scheme this is not true at all. The Woolpunda salt interception scheme is designed to pick up saline inflows as a result of northern Victoria and southern New South Wales once having been an enormous inland sea.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is calculated that just over the border in South Australia, in Woolpunda, as a result of this inland sea 170 tonnes of salt now enter the river daily along this particular stretch of the River Murray. In fact, 8 per cent of the River Murray's total salt load is picked up here. The salt interception scheme that I watched being opened has the capacity, when operating successfully, to reduce salinity at Morgan, the point at which the river turns to the south, by 113 EC units on average. This is a $25m scheme. I commend the Government for its role in the scheme and plead with it to generate additional resources for schemes as important as this.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will give honourable members an impression of what the scheme is about. There are 49 boreholes each side of the river about Woolpunda. Each of these boreholes has a pump on it. Each pump has the capacity to pick up 4 litres of saline water per second. However, the saline water is moving closer to the river at the rate of 10 metres per year. I ask honourable members to consider that. The water has come all the way from northern Victoria and southern New South Wales to reach Woolpunda. It is moving closer to the river basin at the rate of 10 metres per year. This water, intercepted by each of the 49 boreholes-and in one case taken by pump under the river to an evaporation basin-is not only 10 to 20 times more saline than the River Murray water, but in addition when the water appears in the evaporation basin, never having been seen before by human eye, it is probably millions of years old. It has come all the way underground, at the rate of 10 metres per year, from New South Wales and Victoria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evaporation basin which is collecting the saline water is located 15 kilometres south-west of Waikerie, near that bend in the river on which Morgan is located. It is estimated that the evaporation basin there will be receiving water for at least 400 years. The site was chosen because it is an indentation in the land that allows evaporation to occur with a minimum amount of water returning to the river. It is calculated, because of the location of the basin, that it would take 50,000 years for water that has been deposited in the evaporation basin to make its way back into the river.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Woolpunda salt interception scheme has the capacity to dramatically reduce salinity at Morgan in the River Murray. I commend the Government for its implementation of the scheme.

         —Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has dealt with a major issue, and I commend him for it. I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that many businesses in Western Australia are alive and doing some very significant things in the marketplace.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of those is a company currently producing chill packs that have the capacity, through the addition of water to a dry crystal substance, to produce an instant icepack that has application in sport and also in military areas where one can have a cold esky that can be transported into the field. Just by adding water one gets a significant temperature exchange that enables food to be chilled. That is just something that one company is doing. I would like to spend more on that at a future time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to mention also the development of a zinc bromine battery in Western Australia which has enormous potential for the storage of electricity. It enables the taking of mains electricity and storing it in battery form, and it is able to be used in household and factory applications. It has significant application too because it changes base and peak load requirements for electricity generated through the major net.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter I want to address tonight is the safe use of syringes in hospitals, as well as in the marketplace generally. Honourable members may not be aware that one of our really significant health problems at present, particularly for health care workers, concerns the use of the common syringe in hospitals. I refer to the use of syringes on patients by hospital staff. There are difficulties with the exposed needle tip such as is evident in regard to the syringe I have here. Very clearly, there are problems in relation to Aids and to Hepatitis B. The possibility of needlestick injuries is a constant problem for health care workers. There are a significant number of patients with Hepatitis B in hospitals. I emphasise Hepatitis B because although so much attention is focused on Aids, Hepatitis B is also a very serious problem for health care workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        A company in Western Australia called Nujenko has in fact developed a safe retractable syringe. Clearly, its other area of application in the marketplace exists because with a retractable syringe we can eliminate the possibility of needle sharing, which also causes significant problems. I want to draw the attention of the House to this development. I am speaking also with Government Ministers, not with a view to trying necessarily to cosset this company called Nujenko but simply to say that there are companies such as Nujenko prepared to do the market research to enable them to get to the stage where they can produce, for example, syringes capable of being used only once.
       </para>
       <para>
        If serum is drawn up in the syringe and used by the normal injection method, the syringe tip will then collapse inside the housing so that the syringe cannot be used again. It is significant also because of its safety application. One of the problems of hospital use is that people often try to recap the syringe. Obviously, in the pressure of hospital activity, with patients' health at risk and so on, people often injure themselves by trying to recap a syringe, just as I am doing now. In fact, the advantage of the Nujenko retractable syringe is that the needle is retracted inside the syringe housing. It has significant application for health care workers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to say that the Health Department of Western Australia and Dr Charles Watson will be testing the syringe this month at Fremantle Hospital. I think it is important to understand that there are many people in Australia who are prepared to do this sort of work. Another product similar to this is being developed in Queensland but the significance of the Western Australian development is that this syringe will be available at the same cost as existing syringes. I do not think we can possibly expect large hospital systems to shift from their existing syringe use to the use of syringes such as this if it is going to cost them more. However, this syringe will be available on the market at approximately the same cost as the existing syringes used in hospital systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is significant that companies such as Nujenko are prepared to put money into the marketplace to try to develop a syringe which is timely in terms of social outcomes and which is timely also in terms of the demands of health care and hospital workers. I particularly want to draw the attention of the House to this and commend Nujenko for the work it has done in the development of this product.

        —The Reserve Bank has provided the following information in answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The early basis of the relationship between banks owned by state governments and the Reserve Bank was laid down in letters of understanding in 1959/60 (for state savings banks) and 1965 (for other state banks); in the case of South Australia, where the state bank and state savings bank merged in 1984, this understanding was reaffirmed at that time. These early exchanges of letters provided (a) for consultation between the state-owned banks and the Reserve Bank on a range of matters relating to banking trends and policy, and (b) for the Reserve Bank to act as `bankers bank' in relation to the state-owned banks. These letters did not encompass matters relating to `prudential supervision' which has developed only since the mid 1980s.
      </para>
      <para>
       The broad framework for current prudential supervision of banks was promulgated in a Reserve Bank press release dated 4 February 1985; various aspects of the Bank's supervisory arrangements have been modified or varied since that time. While not formally required to do so, state banks have generally observed the Bank's prudential guidelines on a voluntary basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       Major aspects of the Reserve Bank's supervisory requirements are noted below:
      </para>
      <para>
       - Arrangements for the assessment of the capital adequacy of banks were announced in August 1988, to take effect as soon as was practicable. Banks which did not at that time already meet the newly defined minimum requirement were given a transition period (to June 1990 at the latest) during which they had to take measures to achieve the minimum. Once a bank had achieved that position, there was an exchange of letters between the relevant bank and the Reserve Bank wherein the bank gave an assurance that it would comply with the capital requirement thereafter. Obviously, the timing for such exchanges of letters varied. For the state banks, these assurances were given to the Reserve Bank as follows:

       - Guidelines relating to banks' associations with non-banks were detailed to state banks in 1983 (having been given to other banks in the late 1970s) and were further elaborated in September 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       - During 1986, the Bank established tripartite reporting arrangements with banks and their external auditors. State banks and their auditors have participated in these arrangements in the same way as other banks.
      </para>
      <para>
       - The most recent statement of the Bank's policy on banks' large credit exposures was issued in August 1989. All banks, including state banks, were asked to observe the policy at that time.
      </para>
      <para>
       - The Reserve Bank has sought from all banks, including state banks, a formal commitment that they will hold at all times eligible assets sufficient to satisfy the minimum Prime Assets Requirement (PAR) ratio. The Bank most recently sought this undertaking by letter of 12 February 1990, at which time it also announced a progressive reduction in the minimum PAR ratio from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. All banks have given the required undertaking.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There were exchanges of correspondence between the Reserve Bank and Victorian Government on this topic during the first half of 1990. The Victorian Treasurer gave the Reserve Bank the Government's formal undertaking to the new arrangements on 31 July 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In view of the subsequent proposal for the Commonwealth Bank to acquire SBV, there have since the end of July been no specific discussions about supervision issues between the Victorian Government and the Reserve Bank, in terms of the formal arrangements.

       The Government has considered options to restart the wool trade with the USSR and is considering ways to increase wool exports to China. The provision of insurance cover for credit has been considered against the need to balance Australia's overall interests in those markets and the risk of non-payment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am pleased to be able to say that during the course of the Wool Mission from which I have recently returned a credit arrangement has been successfully negotiated with the USSR. I am confident this arrangement will enable a substantial return by the USSR to the Australian wool market.
      </para>
      <para>
       The credit facility provides for a Government guarantee on sales of commodities valued at up to $400 million on a 240 day roll-over basis. I expect that the majority of the credit will be used for wool purchases, but it will also assist with sales of other traditionally traded commodities. A prompt return of the USSR to the Australian wool market will provide a much needed confidence boost to the market place.
      </para>
      <para>
       In China, commercial credit has been offered but appears unlikely to be taken up by Chinese authorities. With the improvement in the Chinese current account position the problem is now not so much lack of credit, but stagnant demand both domestically and from China's export markets. In China there remains a large stockpile of domestic wool, a legacy of the so called `wool war' between the provinces. The austerity measures in place continue to curb demand with little likelihood of substantial sales for some time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some relatively small amounts of wool are being made available from the AWC stockpile at the present time in conjunction with carefully selected industry and product development projects designed to generate a sustained increase in the demand for wool worldwide. These projects are being run jointly by the AWC and the International Wool Secretariat. The IWS in particular, has considerable expertise in undertaking demand building activities for wool. Any credit provided for these sales is provided through normal commercial banking arrangements.

       (1) As at 3 October 1990, the maximum rate of wool tax under the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964 was 20 per cent. An operative rate of 18 per cent applied from 1 July 1990 until 3 October 1990.

      <para>
       (1) In the August 1990 Budget a parental assets test threshold of $200 000 was announced for AUSTUDY and the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme from 1 January 1991. On 8 October 1990 the Government announced the withdrawal of that limit. The 1991 threshold will be $347 500 as a result of indexation of the 1990 threshold of $322 750.
      </para>
      <para>
       All assets are assessed free of debt. The 50 per cent discount is retained for the assets of a farm or other business in which the owner works. This will mean that, where only business and farm assets apply, these can be worth up to $695 000 before a student's allowance is affected.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2)-(3) There is no direct link between the assets and income tests such as an expected net return on capital. In any consideration of assets levels it is necessary to take account of factors other than income generated, such as potential capital gain, ability to negotiate short-term loans using the asset as security, and ability to sell off all or part of the asset.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) To avoid unnecessary complexity in the assets test the Government set a threshold well above the limits under Social Security pensions and benefits, and applied a sudden death cut-off. As a result, it was possible to avoid the introduction of abatement rates and dependent child deductions to the AUSTUDY and AIC assets tests.

       (1) The Australian Taxation Office is giving sympathetic consideration to all requests for deferment of tax payments for people who had a significant portion of their funds frozen by the closure, on 25 June 1990, of the Pyramid Building Society in Geelong. To defer payment of taxes due, these people need to inform their ATO branch offices of their situation and they would be required to provide documentary evidence (either a passbook or account statement) of their position when applying to defer their tax payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Generally speaking, people whose tax liabilities did not become due until 25 June or later, are able to defer their tax payments without any penalty. However, people who had failed to meet their tax liabilities before 25 June would be subject to the late payment penalty from the due date of payment until 25 June 1990.

      <para>
       (1) While my Department provides comprehensive rehabilitation programs for members of the Defence Force who have suffered compensable injuries, including retraining for positions in the general labour market, there is no provision in the Public Service Act which allows former Defence Force members to automatically enter the Australian Public Service. Former Defence personnel wishing to join the Australian Public Service are required to compete with all other applicants for positions in the Public Service on the basis of results obtained in an entrance examination, or compete on merit for positions advertised in the press as available to non-public servants.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 requires the Defence Department to report in terms of numbers of claims where weekly incapacity payments are made to former Defence Force members, not on numbers of medically discharged members receiving full or part compensation. Accordingly the Department's recording system is not designed to provide the specific information sought. However, I can advise that during the Financial Year 1989/90, the Department made weekly incapacity payments to 1061 former Defence Force members.
      </para>

       (3) The cost of the payments made was $13,098,764.

       (3) Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing legislation is in place to protect Australian manufacturers and producers from two types of unfair import competition:

       (a) dumping-where goods are imported into Australia at lower prices than the price paid for like goods in their home market

       (b) subsidisation-where goods are imported into Australia which have been produced and exported with the benefit of government subsidies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The anti dumping measures are aimed at protecting Australian industry where it is established that dumped or subsidised imports have caused, or are threatening to cause, material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods. It is Government policy that antidumping measures do not become de facto forms of assistance to industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Anti-Dumping Authority was established in 1988 for a period of five years, the government announced there would be a mid-term review of administrative arrangements introduced at that time. Any perceived problems with the current arrangements could be examined in that context.

       (1) There are currently 24 rural counsellors funded by the Commonwealth under the Rural Counselling Program.

Funds are provided to the local community groups which employ the counsellors on a dollar for dollar basis to a maximum of $46,200 a year. $960,000 were appropriated for 1990/91 for counsellors' costs, training and support.

The NSW Government, through the Department of Agriculture, provides 25% of the costs of current groups' budgets and has announced that it will provide up to 50% of new groups' budgets for their first year of operation. The Victorian Government is providing $10,000 in cash and $30,000 `in kind' such as office space, or a car. These amounts are spread across all Victorian groups according to need. The Western Australian Government provides $1000, a car and petrol to each group through the Department of Agriculture. In addition, the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation has provided each group in WA with $4000 and in the past the State Lotteries Commission has provided cash to two groups but is not providing any funds this year. In SA the South Australian Government Financing Authority has provided $100,000 for the last 3 years for the use of all SA groups on a needs basis. It has announced, however, that this donation will be discontinued.

       It is not possible to quantify how much early shorn wool was sold in June 1990 to avoid the increased wool tax as the decision to shear early is influenced by a number of factors of which the prospect of an increase in the wool tax from 1 July 1990 would have been only one. The Australian Wool Corporation estimates that of the offerings in the last four selling weeks of each of the last two selling seasons the proportion of prematurely shorn wool was:

       Detailed data on New Zealand live sheep exports is not available, however traditionally New Zealand supplies the majority of the ``Haj'' sheep (approximately 300,000) on contract. The prices received by New Zealand have varied in recent years with the prices paid for the ``Haj'' lambs fluctuating from a low of $20.00 to a present high of $38.00.
      </para>
      <para>
       The maximum number of live sheep that New Zealand could supply within exporter specification is understood to be approximately 600,000 per year, and in 1990 New Zealand exports to Saudi Arabia were in the vicinity of 450,000 head.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia would have expected to have shipped approximately 800,000 head of live sheep to Saudi Arabia in 1990-91 but this forecast has been complicated by the rejection of the Al Gasseem.
      </para>
      <para>
       New Zealand has also now suffered a rejection by Saudi Arabia and the implications of this development for Australia and the rejection of the Al Gasseem are still being examined.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No, I am unable to say whether New Zealand has made arrangements to ship large numbers of sheep to Saudi Arabia in the next twelve months even prior to the rejection. However, I understand the maximum number exported by New Zealand would have been in the vicinity of 600,000 head over the next twelve months.
      </para>
      <para>
       The categories of sheep that New Zealand exports to Saudi are lambs, hoggets and young wethers. The prices would be approximately $A40-45 for lambs, $A38-40 for hoggets and $A30-35 for young wethers.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Since June 1990 most claims for podiatry treatment throughout Australia have been paid within 20 days from the day the claim was received by my Department. This is well within the normal commercial practice of 28 days.
      </para>
      <para>
       A small number of claims (up to 5%) may be delayed because of the need to check that the treatment provided is consistent with the client's accepted disability and therefore payable by the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further small number of claims may be returned because of incorrect or insufficient information, failure to adhere to guidelines on provision of treatment, etc. These claims are returned to podiatrists for clarification and, if appropriate, are re-submitted for payment. Such delays are beyond the Department's control. However, educational campaigns are continually undertaken to alleviate these problems and procedures continue to be evaluated for possible streamlining.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a)-(d) In the 1989/90 Budget, mileage allowance for travel by health providers was restricted to travel undertaken beyond a provider's local area.
      </para>
      <para>
       Normal allowances will be paid if a provider, who must travel more than 10 kilometres for each service, can justify the distance travelled. In these cases the Department will pay the distance travelled beyond the first 10 kilometres.
      </para>
      <para>
       The rates payable for travel allowance are determined annually by the Department of Industrial Relations and apply to all Departmental staff under the Public Service Act. The rate is also applicable to podiatrists and is aligned to that for vehicles with an engine capacity of over 2000 cc but not more than 3000 cc. This rate has been endorsed by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Fees and Allowances (IDCFA).

       (2) Applications for tax file numbers and passports cannot be lodged with post office agencies at the present time because the agency principals, i.e. the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade respectively, prefer to use only the official post office network for reasons of confidentiality and security. I understand that with regard to passports a clause has been included in the new contract between Australia Post and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which may result in some post office agencies gaining passport application business.

       (3) Fifteen Battle of Britain veterans and thirteen of their ladies travelled on the aircraft. Originally, the CAS extended invitations to 26 Battle of Britain aircrew veterans and 23 ladies. Some veterans made their own way to the UK and ill health prevented a few veterans from travelling on an overseas flight.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The aircraft departed Australia on 2 September 1990 and returned on 21 September 1990. In transit, the itinerary was related to the route of the aircraft which was similar to that followed by the standard RAAF European service. However, to make the legs more equidistant and comfortable for the veterans on the forward journey, the aircraft travelled via Honolulu, USA, and Winnipeg, Canada to Stanstead in the UK. The return itinerary was via Washington and Honolulu USA to RAAF Richmond. Because there was only a non-augmented crew available for the task, crew duty limitations governed the daily maximum flight time and the duration of crew rest on stopovers. All veterans were responsible for their own accommodation, meal expenses and insurance throughout the journey. Whilst in the UK the veterans organised their own personal program. Before departure from Australia veterans and their ladies obtained tickets and passes to official Battle of Britain functions from the Battle of Britain Fighter Association and the RAAF had no knowledge or responsibility for this aspect of the organisation. In the UK during the week prior to the celebrations, a group of RAAF pilots did travel by bus to the Vintage Air Show at Folkestone. A small number of veterans joined the group on that occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The most senior ranking officer of the veteran group, Sir Ronald Lees of Adelaide, returned on the B707 aircraft from Honolulu to RAAF Richmond. He was under constant medical attention for the duration of the journey and returned to his home in Adelaide. His precise medical condition is unknown at this time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The CAS, Air Marshal Ray Funnell, originally intended travelling on the B707 with the veterans. However, work commitments prevented him leaving Australia on 2 September 1990, and thus he had to proceed to the UK by civil air arriving in the UK on 12 September 1990 in time for the Battle of Britain celebrations. He was accompanied by his Wing Commander staff officer. Due to the conflict in the Gulf, the whole Battle of Britain detachment almost faltered forty-eight hours prior to departure. This was because of an operational requirement for the use of the B707. However, on 1 September 1990 clearance was given for the tasking of the RAAF B707 on 2 September 1990 with the proviso that the aircraft could, firstly, be diverted as the operational requirement arose and secondly, replaced if and when another RAAF B707 became available. As it transpired, the aircraft in fact remained with the detachment in the UK and another aircraft became serviceable and was put on standby for an operational requirement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) When the decision was made by CAS to include the veteran group and their ladies in the RAAF Battle of Britain visit, because of space limitations and lack of information on the number of Battle of Britain ground crew veterans resident in Australia, the decision was made to exclude ground crew veterans. Subsequently, numerous requests were received through varying channels; i.e. local members, ministers, etc to take two ground crew veteran personnel with the RAAF group. The earlier decision was reviewed but upheld, as there still was no documentary evidence to prove exactly how many veteran ground crew personnel would be eligible for the flight and a common policy had to apply to all eligible ground crew. As an aside, the gentlemen in question, Mr Colson and Mr Carter, were subsequently both offered free travel by QANTAS and indeed arrived in the UK in time to participate in the Battle of Britain celebrations.

       (a) I understand that the Criminal Code Amendment (Racial Harassment and Incitement to Racial Hatred) Act 1990 (WA) came into effect on 6 November 1990.

       (b) I have seen recent media reports referring to acts of vandalism and violence directed at various ethnic groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Article 4 (a) of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination requires States Parties to enact as criminal offences the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, acts of racist violence, and acts inciting racial discrimination or violence. Australia's reservation to Article 4(a) indicates that Australia does not treat as specific offences all the matters covered in the Article. Australia would need to be in a position to observe the requirements of Article 4(a) before withdrawing the reservation. The Government has been considering the question of such legislation, recognising the complexity of finding a balance between freedom of speech and the rights of people to live without fear of racist violence or abuse. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Inquiry into Racist Violence is due to report in early 1991 and the Government will further consider this matter in the light of the findings of that inquiry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The question of making a declaration under Article 14 of the Convention has been discussed in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General over a number of years. At present, the Government is focussing its efforts in the Standing Committee on resolving the related issue of accession to the First Optional Protocol, and will then turn its attention to the declaration under Article 14.

       (2) In October 1990 the Special Premiers' Conference unanimously agreed that the National Rail Freight Corporation would commence operations on 1 July 1991. The Corporation will encompass all existing interstate rail freight operations and will involve Commonwealth and State equity contributions. Australia's Transport Ministers have established a National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force which is examining various issues for consideration by Government in early 1991, including the track to be used by the Corporation. These matters will be addressed by the Special Premiers' Conference scheduled for May 1991.

       (3) I understand that following the findings of the Sydney-Melbourne Railway Electrification Study in 1980 the Federal Government offered to provide $300 million (or 50 per cent of the cost) towards electrification of the Sydney-Melbourne line. This proposal was given a low priority by the New South Wales and Victorian Governments and the Federal Government later withdrew the offer.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Information on previous employment including the reason for leaving is collected at the time of claim for unemployment benefit to ensure that payment is made only to those who are eligible, but limited information on previous employment is kept on Departmental computer files. On 14 December 1990 there were 5,836 unemployment beneficiaries who were clients of Mirrabooka Regional Office. Of these, 1,499 had been transferred from pensions or other benefits or were new entrants to the work force. The remaining 4,337 may have been dismissed, retrenched or in some other way have lost their jobs. However, further details are not readily available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) It is not known how many of the beneficiaries referred to in part (1) had previously been employed in the area of the city of Wanneroo. However, it is estimated that no more than 5 per cent of claimants would have been employed in the fruit growing and market garden industry.
      </para>

       On 14 December 1990 the number of unemployment beneficiaries whose address showed Wanneroo postcode (6065) was 524.

       (3) The Department does not keep (a) statistics on the number of investigations of applicants for unemployment benefit who state that they have been dismissed by their previous employer. However, it is normal practice for investigations of applications for unemployment benefit to be made by staff when the information supplied on the application warrants further enquiry.

       Three manufacturers of colour televisions remain: Sharp (Blacktown), NEC (Penrith) and National Matsushita (Penrith). Philips and Sanyo each closed a plant in 1987. In that round of closures falling tariff rates were cited by the companies as the main reason, however, other factors were:
      </para>
      <para>
       - stable demand for larger sets, where Australian production has concentrated, and limited returns on investment in scale efficiencies in the Australian market,

      </para>
      <para>
       Statistics for 1985-1988 are estimates only. During that period imports of television receivers were aggregated with other electronic equipment, such as stereo equipment, and clock and car radios, which cannot be easily distinguished from statistics on television receivers. Accurate import statistics can only be provided for colour televisions in those years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Statistics for 1987/88 present special difficulties as in January 1988 new import classification codes were introduced. Consequently the import classification in the six months to December 1987 is different from the import classification of televisions in the six months to June 1988. The 1987/88 statistics reflect the inclusion of other electronic equipment in the first six month period and accurate import figures for television receivers in the latter six month period.

       (2) No one has ever suggested the complete replacement of the Australian automotive industry with imports but rather maintaining pressure on the industry to become more internationally competitive.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Industry Commission in its draft report on the automotive industry recommended a continued reduction in tariff protection which would bring this sector more in line with levels of Government assistance applying to the rest of manufacturing industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Using the ORANI model, the Commission predicted significant benefits to the Australian community of this tariff reduction. There would be an annual increase in Gross Domestic Product of 0.3 per cent or some $1 billion in 1988-89 prices. Real wages are projected to rise by 0.3 per cent and CPI to fall by 0.5 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission also predicted that aggregate employment in the economy would be little different and there would be an increase in both exports and imports having a negligible overall effect on Australia's Balance of Trade.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The number of taxpayers required to pay QPT varies as their provisional tax falls below or rises above the QPT threshold which is currently $8,000 p.a. Taking the most recent issue of QPT instalment notices as an indicator, as at 22/10/90, 148,238 taxpayers were liable to pay their provisional tax under QPT arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Due to ATO processing limitations on the receipt of payments and variables such as public holidays which tend to vary from state to state, the due dates specified on instalment notices tend to be spread over six days following the earliest possible due date.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The date for the issue of notices in each quarter is chosen to achieve due dates for payments which are as close to the earliest possible due date specified in the law while still allowing taxpayers at least 33 days from notice issue to due date. For example, the law specifies that the first instalment cannot be due before 1 September; therefore issue of notices for this instalment will be approximately 33 days prior to 1 September.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As explained in (2) above, payment dates will tend to vary among taxpayers by several days. ATO systems apply the earliest due date to the largest instalments and the latest due date to the smallest instalments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Approximately 70 ATO staff are engaged full time on QPT-related work at a salary cost of some $900,000 p.a. However, most QPT work, including payment processing, is combined with similar work from other payment systems and therefore needs to be apportioned. Overall, that is taking into account buildings, equipment, administrative costs, salaries and overheads, and so on, the annual cost of the QPT system to the ATO is estimated to be approximately $7m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Considerable economies of scale are achieved by automated issue and despatch of the bulk of QPT notices four times a year. A system of intermittent issue would eliminate these economies and incur considerable additional equipment and processing costs. It is not possible to accurately estimate the net additional outlays which would be involved if such changes were to be attempted using the ATO's present computer systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The Income Tax Assessment Act allows taxpayers to assess and vary their provisional tax (including QPT) liability. Extension of Self- assessment concepts to QPT and the other payment systems will depend on Government decisions relating to the Consultative Document on Self-Assessment issued by the Treasurer on 13 December 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The Government is most concerned with equity in the tax system generally, and specifically as it relates to the timing of payments. The changes made to bring forward company tax payments closer to their year of income, and therefore more in line with PAYE individuals and the bulk of other businesses in Australia, and the imposition of provisional tax on salary and wage income where there is a shortfall in tax instalment deductions, demonstrate this concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) One of the primary aims of introducing the QPT system was to increase the equity between PAYE and provisional taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) It is likely that some taxpayers may not have received all or part of the income to which the instalment of tax relates. Many of these same taxpayers will, of course, have had the opportunity to earn interest on money they will eventually pay as tax-this is an advantage which is not available to PAYE payers who have their tax withheld by their employers. The Income Tax Assessment Act does provide relief where income flow is such that significant disadvantage is likely. Taxpayers who receive more than 75% of their income after 1 December in a financial year can apply for ``seasonal status'' which will require them to pay two instalments only with due dates no earlier than 1 February and 1 June respectively. These instalments are issued manually.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Not in respect of their salary and wage income tax which is withheld at source by their employers. However, many PAYE payers have additional sources of income on which they pay tax through the provisional or QPT systems.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) arises from Resolution 44/228 of the 1989 United Nations General Assembly and will be held in Brazil from 1 to 12 June 1992. The agenda for the UNCED will be derived from the broad aim of Resolution 44/228 to develop a comprehensive program of international action to maintain the quality of the earth's environment through the achievement of ecologically sound and sustainable development in all countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       More specifically, Resolution 44/228 identifies nine key issues which are to be addressed by the conference:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Protection of the atmosphere by combating climate change, depletion of the ozone layer and transboundary air pollution;
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Protection of the oceans and all kinds of seas, including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, and of their living resources;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Protection and management of land resources by, inter alia, combating deforestation, desertification and drought;
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) Conservation of biological diversity;

      <para>
       (h) Improvement of the living and working environment of the poor in urban slums and rural areas, through the eradication of poverty by, inter alia, implementing integrated rural and urban development programmes, as well as taking other appropriate measures at all levels necessary to stem the degradation of the environment;
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Protection of human health conditions and improvement of the quality of life.
      </para>
      <para>
       Resolution 44/228 also identified cross-sectoral issues, such as technology transfer, financial assistance and education, as central to the consideration of these environmental concerns.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Resolution 44/228 established a Preparatory Committee and Secretariat for the UNCED. The Preparatory Committee has three broad tasks:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Draft the provisional agenda of the Conference, in accordance with the provisions of Resolution;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Adopt guidelines to enable States to take a harmonised approach to their preparations and reporting;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Prepare draft decisions for the Conference and submit them to the Conference for consideration and adoption.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Preparatory Committee held its first substantive meeting in Nairobi in August 1990 and will meet a further three times in the lead up to the UNCED.

        —The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The CAA is proposing a number of changes to its airspace management arrangements, including provision of a new radar based traffic advisory service. This service will considerably extend the radar services now provided. Under the CAA's existing Radar Sensor Procurement Program, radar coverage of Australian airspace is being significantly extended from Cairns down the east coast and across to Adelaide and around Perth.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The CAA is proposing that under Class G airspace, pilots will provide their own traffic information directly to each other via common traffic frequencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Pilots have always used the ``see and avoid'' principle of aircraft separation in weather conditions which allow them to sight conflicting traffic in time to take necessary avoidance action. The CAA is proposing to retain these procedures in all classes of airspace, and will continue to supplement them with radio and radar and flight techniques. When visibility is poor ``see and avoid'' procedures would not be applicable and pilots would need to maintain separation using other means, such as radio.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The CAA is proposing that pilots monitor and transmit information relating to their position on one, or more, of the listed frequencies. Which frequency is used will depend on the pilot's requirements, the aircraft's geographic position and which leg of the flight is being undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (6) The CAA is proposing to retain the requirement for all aircraft operating above 5000ft to carry and use radio. The Authority is also considering mandatory carriage and use of radio by all aircraft operating within the vicinity of licensed aerodromes. Visual Flight Rules, non-commercial aircraft not equipped to carry radios could use hand-held radios.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) All Australian aircraft operating in Australian airspace must meet appropriate Australian airworthiness standards and comply with pertinent Australian operational safety requirements. Foreign aircraft operating in Australian airspace, such as overseas airlines, must meet the airworthiness requirements of the State of Registration of the aircraft, but must still comply with Australian operational rules when within Australian airspace.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) (a)-(e) It is the policy of the CAA that all aircraft normally located in Australia should be placed on the Australian Register; thereby becoming fully subject to Australian regulatory oversight. However, the CAA recognises that it would be unreasonable to insist that aircraft on short term service in Australia, that is, less than six months, be placed on the Register.
      </para>
      <para>
       For this reason, the CAA permits aircraft on short term service in Australia to retain their foreign registration on condition that, in each case, a satisfactory arrangement for regulatory oversight of such aircraft be negotiated between the CAA and the regulatory authority of the country of origin.
      </para>
      <para>
       This policy is consistent with overseas practice and allows the greatest reasonable level of Australian regulatory oversight of operations within Australia, while at the same time taking account of the commercial and developmental objectives of the Australian aviation industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) ICAO Annexe II, Chapter 4, Paragraph 42 refers to the scope of the flight information service. It does recommend that information about known aircraft which may constitute a collision hazard be passed on to other aircraft, and states further that``air traffic services units cannot assume responsibility for its issuance at all times or for its accuracy''.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) The CAA does intend to adopt the standard referred to in part (10).

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) In July 1989 at its 18th Session the Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted guideline levels for radionuclides in foods following accidental nuclear contamination.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) &amp;(c) The guideline levels are applicable for one year following a nuclear accident. The Commission adopted, as an interim measure, the following definition of ``guideline levels'': ``Guideline levels are intended for use in regulating foods moving in international trade. When the guideline levels are exceeded, governments should decide whether, and under which circumstances, the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction.''
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia was represented by the Australian Radiation Laboratory of the Department of Community Services and Health on a working group whose report formed the basis for joint WHOFAO recommendations on which the guideline levels were based. State health departments were kept informed through their representation on the Radiation Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The currently accepted values of the half-lives of the radionuclides are (a) 432.7 years for americium-241, (b) 24 110 years for plutonium-239, (c) 28.5 years for strontium-90, (d) 8.04 days for iodine-131, (e) 2.06 years for caesium-134 and 30.0 years for caesium-137.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The report of the working group referred to in part (c) above states:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``The individual radiation dose in the second and subsequent years after a nuclear accident is likely to be considerably less than that received in the first year. In this case it is not necessary to revise the intervention dose levels or derived intervention levels for successive years, since the situation in individual countries will vary. In the rare situation in which the annual radiation dose has not fallen significantly by the second or third year, it is for the competent authorities to consider the specific circumstances and decide whether additional action is needed.''
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. The guideline levels are established for three ``dose per unit intake'' levels: the radionuclides mentioned in the question are included as ``representative radionuclides'' for each of these levels, but this does not exclude other radionuclides within each category. The six mentioned are, however, regarded by the WHO-FAO group as being of greatest potential significance in contamination of the food chain following a nuclear accident.
