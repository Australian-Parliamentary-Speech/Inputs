         —In proposing the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) to this House, I am conscious of his very significant record as a member of this Parliament and of the Victorian Parliament and also of the fact that this House initially accepted him at a time when the present Opposition thought the Westminster principles had some relevance. This House accepted him unopposed as the Speaker at the formation of the previous Parliament. He is a man who has the respect, I believe, of every member who has served in this Parliament during his term, especially during his period as Speaker in the previous Parliament. His standing, both in this Parliament and outside it, makes him an ideal candidate to be Speaker in this period of the House of Representatives. Mr Clerk, I believe that this House will do itself justice by reappointing the honourable member for Scullin as Speaker for the ensuing period.

         —Mr Clerk, it is my privilege to nominate Mr James Donald Mathieson Dobie, the honourable member for Cook, for the position of Speaker. Mr Dobie has been a member of this Parliament, except for one brief interruption, since 1966, when he was elected as the member for the seat of Hughes. He has had wide experience in every aspect of the conduct of the business of this House. He has had extensive committee service, dating back to 1967, including the chairmanship of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He has served as Deputy Chairman of Committees for two periods. He has played an active role in many other aspects of the life of this Parliament. In 1979 he served as the Commonwealth Parliament's observer at the Zimbabwe elections, a position of considerable interest and responsibility at the time. The honourable member for Cook has earned the respect of honourable members on both sides of the House, and throughout his career he has consistently demonstrated a sense of judgment and of fairness and consistency.

        We on this side of the House believe that the honourable member for Cook, for those foregoing reasons, is a person who would do very great honour to this very high position. But there is one additional reason why, with great enthusiasm, we sponsor the honourable member for Cook, and that is that before the last election there were some misguided people who occasionally forecast the electoral demise of the honourable member for Cook at that election. I am very pleased to report that he recorded a swing of 5 per cent in his favour, the largest swing of any alleged marginal seat-holder in New South Wales. For that reason, above all others, the Opposition is more than delighted to sponsor the honourable member for Cook as a candidate for Speaker.

        Mr Clerk, the honourable member has an awesome record of involvement in the political life of this country. His 24 years of State and Commonwealth parliamentary service show a consistency on his part as to what constitute the fundamental issues. He has shown a concern about Commonwealth-State relations and constitutional reform which has led him to stress the need to bring the Australian Constitution into the twentieth century.

        More than 20 years ago he spoke of the need to arrest the environmental devastation which industry was inflicting on our cities and countryside. His championing of the twin goals of peace and disarmament has won him enormous respect both within the Australian Labor movement and in the wider community. The concern which he has always voiced about young people and the quality of education in this country will, I know, be of particular relevance during 1985-the designated International Youth Year.

        We are living in a time of rapid social change-a time when values and priorities are shifting, perhaps a little too fast for the comfort of many in our society. We have seen some disturbing figures during the last few days about the community's perception and knowledge of politics, politicians and our political institutions but it gives me and many of my colleagues great hope to see the emphasis which the honourable member for Scullin always places on maintaining the dignity of the proceedings in this House. Public perception of the integrity of this place rests not only on the legislative program of the government but also on the conduct of the House. During the Thirty-third Parliament the honourable member for Scullin furnished us with numerous examples of the way in which his respect for the role of Speaker invests the proceedings of this House with qualities which command the respect of the community at large.

       <para>
        Mr Clerk, the diligence, effectiveness and compassion with which the honourable member for Scullin carried out his duties as Speaker during the previous session of Parliament lead me to suggest that it would be in the interests of members on both sides of this House to elect Dr Jenkins for a second term in the certain knowledge that he will always conduct the business of the House with dignity and integrity. It is my pleasure to second the nomination.

We know our former Speaker to be a beaut bloke and most of us have a deep respect for him. I might add that I have not only respect but an affection for him, and I make no secret of it. I should explain, particularly for the benefit of those who will have perhaps a happy but brief interlude in this House and who are entering the gentle stage of their political careers, that there is more to it than just respect and affection. Don Dobie, who we suggest should occupy the position of Speaker, has to his advantage a great and profound experience of the operation of many parliaments throughout the world. Not only is he familiar with the system but also he is familiar with the parliaments themselves. So he would bring to this House a great degree of impartiality. His election would also prove to the House the substance of the assertion made by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In very decisive terms during his first campaign he pointed out that where he saw talent amongst the other parties he would certainly single out that talent and put it at the disposal of the House. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I second the nomination of Don Dobie. I think he would conduct this House in a splendid and impartial manner.

         —Mr Speaker, personally and on behalf of the Government, I extend to you sincere congratulations on your election to this high and responsible office of Speaker. As has already been indicated, Mr Speaker, you bring to this position a very considerable range of experience. You served in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1961 to 1969. You came to this House in 1969 and have been consistently a member of it since then. You held the position of Deputy Chairman of Committees for two periods from March 1973 to March 1975 and from February 1976 to February 1983, and the position of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from August 1975 to February 1976.

       <para>
        Your experience also brought an international dimension to the position. In 1975 you were leader of a delegation studying parliamentary committee systems in Canada and the United Kingdom and from September to December 1979 you were the parliamentary adviser to the Australian delegation to the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Within your own Party, you were Secretary of that parliamentary party from 1976 to 1978 and its Chairman from 1981 to 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was because of that vast range of experience, in the State of Victoria and this Parliament in Australia and internationally, that all of us in this House expected, when you were first elected to the Speakership on 21 April 1983, that you would discharge the tenure of that position with great distinction. I believe that no member of this House in that period was in any sense disappointed as a result of the expectations held of you when you were first elected to that high office. Mr Speaker, we believe that in that period you discharged assiduously the duties of what is at times an extremely difficult office. We believe that you performed those duties impartially and that you brought, as far as it is possible to do so, a sense of humour as well as firmness to the discharge of that position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, because of the experience to which we referred and the great deal of satisfaction that we all feel with the way in which you discharged the duties in the previous Parliament, we congratulate you. I add this in conclusion: I think all of us are aware that a great source of comfort and strength to you is the consistent presence, devotion and dedicated support of your wife, Wendy, who is a very regular attender in this place. In paying tribute to you, we do so also to her. We wish you well.

I think that even the narrowness of the vote for your election illustrates that the Thirty-fourth Parliament of the Commonwealth will be a somewhat different place from the Thirty-third Parliament. It means that the obligations and pressures of trying to preserve harmony and sometimes ensuring that there is at least an adequate opportunity for the Opposition to express its point of view, as there is for the Government, will be slightly greater.

I think most honourable members are aware that the Minister and I have had a long association over the years and are good friends in that sense. I thank the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin) for seconding my nomination. The honourable member is one of the class of '83 and had some of the learning process in the last Parliament.

When I complete my remarks he will realise that I am aware of the problems that arise as a result of the increased membership of the House and of the fact that we must take a sensible look at them. I thank the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair). I know of his deep interest in the Standing Orders and practices of the House.

         I suppose that every Speaker would like to feel that he had left his own mark on the Parliament. It is very difficult for a Speaker to do so. However, I believe that a Speaker should have some aims in what he hopes to do in the term of office given to him by the House. We have an enlarged House. The shift to the new Parliament House is imminent. I believe that we need to look at the procedures of the House. I take the point that, when looking at those procedures, a bipartisan approach must be taken so that we are assured that not only Government but also Opposition members are able to participate freely in the discussion that goes on. While I have a liking for some tradition and ceremonial, I believe that if procedures become archaic and need modernising to allow honourable members on both sides of the House to participate more fully we should do something about it.

         Honourable members know of my keen interest in the broadcasting and televising of the Parliament. In the last Parliament the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings was looking at this matter. I trust that early in this Parliament that Committee, which I chair, will be able to bring down suggestions in that area, which will provide a firm basis for the future use of those means of communication in the new Parliament House. Those who experienced the experiment of televising last year and the problems that space restrictions caused will realise that we are in an even worse position this year as far as space is concerned.

        <para>
         With that growing complexity, the shift that is going on and the pressures and demands from honourable members for facilities and so on, I believe that at this stage we must take a good look at the career structure and the administration of the parliamentary departments so that when the shift takes place there will be a sound structure, procedurally, career-wise and administratively, for the future of the Parliament.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope that honourable members, when they talk about the duties of the Speaker, appreciate and acknowledge that I try to show tolerance. I will do so, to allow rational and even lively debate, but I hope honourable members will also realise that there are limits to tolerance and that there are limits beyond which the Chair should not be pushed if everyone is to get a fair go in the debate. In the last Parliament I tried to have an open-door approach for honourable members who sought advice. I hope they will appreciate that I intend to continue that practice. I thank the House once again for the honour it has given me.

       <para>
        The Speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:
       </para>
       <para>
        The 34th Parliament assembles following general elections on 1 December 1984 in which the people of Australia confirmed their choice of national direction by returning the Government with a substantial majority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is pledged to carry out the clear mandate of the Australian people to build upon the achievements of its first term in creating a stronger, fairer and more equitable Australian society.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its first term of office the Government received the support and co-operation of Australians in embarking on a course never previously attempted in Australia during peacetime-a course of national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction. The Government is confident that the co-operation so essential for Australia's success will be maintained.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the period since Labor won office Australia has experienced its strongest and most sustained economic performance for decades, the inflation rate has been brought down from twice the rate of other industrial countries two years ago to a level now close to the OECD average, and the unemployment rate has also been drastically cut during the period. At the same time the Government has created a strong momentum toward the change which is necessary to eliminate unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is determined to maintain strong economic and employment growth with low inflation, to ensure that the benefits of a growing economy are fairly shared in the community, and to sustain the sense of national purpose that has returned to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        You, the members of the Parliament of Australia, have been called together to provide the legislative basis upon which the commitments made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government at the recent election will be carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Economy
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's major task in its first term was the revival of the nation's economy. Economic policy was directed toward the simultaneous reduction of inflation and unemployment. The success of this approach in the past eighteen months has been clear. The economy has grown rapidly and the conditions have been established for further strong growth in the period ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government intends to maintain the approach to economic policy which has been so successful in its first term of office. It will continue to pursue responsible economic policies which will lead to continued growth in the Australian economy, particularly in the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prices and Incomes Accord has played a crucial role in Australia's economic success. The Accord will continue to be the centrepiece of the Government's economic strategy and the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth. The Government maintains its commitment to the policies in the Accord and will give particular emphasis to the maintenance of an effective wage fixing system to protect real living standards whilst ensuring moderation in labour cost increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government proposes a major review of the Australian tax system during 1985. The Government has given the people of Australia explicit commitments regarding the budget deficit, budget expenditures and taxation. None of these will be increased as a proportion of gross domestic product in 1985-86 and over the Government's second term.
       </para>
       <para>
        The taxation review will be undertaken within the framework of the nine basic principles and objectives enunciated by the Prime Minister on 31 October 1984. These are designed to ensure that reform will make the tax scheme simpler, fairer and more efficient. An integral part of the taxation review process will be a National Tax Summit, with full community representation, to be held in the first week of July this year. The Government will also continue to give the highest priority to measures against tax avoidance and evasion. It will reintroduce the ''bottom-of-the-harbour'' bills rejected during the last Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will move further towards its objective of removing unnecessary controls in the financial system and increasing the efficiency of the financial and business sectors. The successful applicants for new banking authorities will be announced shortly. Legislation will be introduced if necessary to ensure the adequacy of arrangements for the prudential supervision of banks and insurance intermediaries following a review of existing provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present arrangements for determining general revenue assistance to the States expire on 30 June 1985 and the Government will conduct a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State financial relations early in its term of office. This will include a special Premiers' Conference in May of this year in addition to the regular June Premiers' Conference and Loan Council Meetings.

        The Community Employment Program was launched in August 1983 and by December 1984 nearly 57,000 jobs had been created under the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the current financial year up to 65,000 people will be assisted under the Community Employment Program. The possible extension of the program in the private sector will also be explored.

        In conjunction with State and Territory Governments, a New Enterprise Initiatives Scheme will be established on a pilot basis during 1984-85. This will enable unemployed people with viable business propositions to be eligible to receive continued income support for up to a year while they establish their own small enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government remains deeply concerned at the disproportionate share of unemployment which is borne in Australia by young people. In its first term the Government undertook a range of specific measures to improve youth employment prospects. These included greater support for apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship training, work experience opportunities, and community youth support programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, on the basis of recommendations received from the independent Committee of Inquiry, chaired by Mr Peter Kirby, the Government intends reforming labour market programs to give greater emphasis to improved training and work skills development. Particular emphasis will be given to providing broad skill-based training as one way to improve the opportunities open to our young people in the labour market, and especially for young people who have experienced prolonged unemployment or who are otherwise disadvantaged. The Government will be undertaking extensive consultations with State Governments, unions, employers and other groups concerning the implementation of policies in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Government will give high priority to reforming the industrial relations system in the light of the report of the Hancock Review into Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems and to implementing a comprehensive national occupational health and safety policy. Legislation will be introduced to establish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission on a statutory basis.

        Community Welfare
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that economic growth is not an end in itself, but a means to greater ends-a means towards the achievement of high social goals of equity and fairness. On the basis of the strong economic growth achieved, the Government during its first term provided low income groups with substantial additional assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unemployment benefits for single adults were increased by over 25 per cent. There has been a real increase in pensions, and the tax burden on low income families, including pensioner and beneficiary families, has been reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its coming term the Government will continue to give a high priority to improving the living standards of the most needy in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reflecting the priority the Government attaches to ensuring more equitable access to a range of community services the Government has established a new Department of Community Services which will ensure that services are equitably distributed and better co-ordinated with those of States, local government and community groups. Those requiring special assistance will have greater access to the resources of our society.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its second term of office, the Government will ensure the maintenance of the Medicare program which has extended health services and an insurance system to all Australians on a fair, affordable and stable basis. The Medicare levy of 1 per cent of taxable income will not be increased during the Government's second term. Medicare will be extended to provide reciprocal health care arrangements for countries with which Australia has close ties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has demonstrated its firm commitment to the veterans who have served this country. A comprehensive review of the Repatriation Act and associated legislation is nearing completion which will consolidate and clarify the present complex series of Acts. The new legislation, to be introduced in the Autumn Sittings, will not adversely affect current beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government regards a sound housing and construction industry as an important social and economic objective. It will continue to give priority to this sector. The highly successful First Home Owners Scheme will continue and the new ten year Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement will make a direct attack on housing related poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Education
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is convinced of the primary importance of enhancing the quality of education at all levels of the education system in Australia. The Government is already committed to directing greater financial resources to the education sector to meet this need.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is committed to providing both government and non-government schools with substantial real increases in funding over the next eight years. The forthcoming report of the Quality of Education Review Committee chaired by Professor Peter Karmel will be an important further step in developing the Government's policy of using education funding to produce the most effective and highest quality education system possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Measures which the Government has already introduced to improve resource levels and increase participation and equity in tertiary education will be continued.

        Industry Development
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government remains committed to developing a strong and competitive manufacturing industry. In its first term long range plans for the revitalisation of the steel industry, the passenger motor vehicle industry and the shipbuilding industry were set in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will continue to formulate positive policy approaches to industry development. One of our objectives is to build closer links between industry and research, so that Australian industry gains the greatest benefits possible from the work being done by the CSIRO and tertiary institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major review of business regulation which is already underway will be carried through.

        Primary Industry
       </para>
       <para>
        The revival witnessed in the last two years in the rural sector has emphasised the important contribution it makes to the general level of Australia's economic activity and, more specifically, to Australia's export earning capacity. A major report on primary industry to the year 2000 will be developed this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will continue to place great importance on the rapport it has achieved with rural communities, industries and their representatives.

        Trade
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's export performance in recent decades has declined significantly. Our trading prospects now, particularly in commodities, are uncertain. New forms of protection and export support are proliferating around the world, food self-sufficiency is increasing and increased competition in minerals and manufactured exports is coming from developing countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is determined that Australia will be in a position to meet this challenge by targeting particular markets and products and, through co-operation with the countries in our region, seeking ways to reduce barriers to trade and promote the interests of the people of the Pacific region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recognising that growth in world trade is in manufactured goods and services, the Government will continue the steps being taken to ensure the close integration of our trade and industry policies which is needed to reflect these changing opportunities.

       <para>
        Resources
       </para>
       <para>
        In its first term the Government established the Australian Coal Consultative Council and the Iron Ore Consultative Committee. Changes to the coal export duty have assisted the coal industry, and improved taxation arrangements have allowed mineral exploration to be deducted from income from any source, a measure which has benefited all mining and mineral industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its second term the Government will continue the support which it has given to petroleum exploration and development in offshore areas. The Government will introduce legislation to establish a Resource Rent Tax to apply to new petroleum developments offshore in place of royalties and excise which would otherwise apply. The Government will introduce a cash bidding system for highly prospective petroleum areas in the territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and will hold discussions with the States with a view to introducing the new tax regime in other offshore areas.
       </para>

       <para>
        The Government remains deeply committed to advancing the cause of peace, arms control and disarmament. At the Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be held in Geneva in August and September this year, the Australian Government will make efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and will continue to urge the nuclear weapon powers towards a complete ban on all forms of nuclear testing. It will actively promote programs for the International Year of Peace in 1986, and will advance the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will continue to give priority to developing Australia's relations with our neighbours in South East Asia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, the South West Pacific, the Indian sub-continent and the Indian Ocean region. In the wider Asia-Pacific region, Australia's very significant and wide ranging relations with Japan will be maintained. The Government will continue to give very high priority to further diversifying and deepening relations with the People's Republic of China. The Government will continue to support economic co-operation among countries of the Pacific.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its second term the Government expects to continue to enjoy a mature relationship of mutual respect and close co-operation with our major ally the United States of America.

Australia will continue to maintain defence co-operative arrangements with New Zealand.
       </para>

         —It is indeed an honour and a privilege for me to nominate Mrs Child for the position of Chairman of Committees. In the last Parliament Mrs Child was Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees throughout 1984. She earned for herself an excellent reputation for her work in the chair and the high regard of honourable members from both sides of the House. Mrs Child was first elected in 1974 and she has served with great distinction in this chamber. She has also served the community in which she lives for more than two decades. She is held in very high esteem by the people in that community whom she has assisted in various ways over many years. As a personal friend, I say that her warmth and sincerity are admired by all. Her open-door approach has been of great assistance to members of this House, especially the newer members of the Parliament. I am sure that she will continue that approach throughout the Thirty-fourth Parliament. It gives me great pleasure to nominate the honourable member for Henty, Mrs Child.

         —It is a privilege for me to nominate Clarrie Millar. There was some confusion when I nominated Percival Clarence because that, of course, assumes a new member of the House. But when I mention Clarrie Millar he will be remembered with much affection and recognised very easily by honourable members as the man with the good haircut. In nominating Clarrie Millar as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker I do so in the confidence that Mr Millar would have the full support of our Opposition parties and certainly the respect of those members of the Government who, in opposition, were able to judge the fairness and impartiality of the honourable member when he presided as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in the thirty-first and thirty-second Parliaments from 1977 to 1983. Mr Speaker, I believe it is imperative that the occupants of the two highest offices in this chamber-that is, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker-become creatures or servants of the whole chamber and not just one political branch of it. To be so elected through a contest within the House can only strengthen the hand and the authority of those Presiding Officers.

        For those honourable members who might feel that my friendship with my fellow Queenslander, Clarrie, would make suspect my comments on his nomination, I would like to draw on certain references by distinguished ladies and gentlemen that were expressed in this House in 1983. For instance, the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), the nominee from the Government side, had this to say about the honourable member for Wide Bay:
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) occupied this office in the last Parliament and justifiably earned the respect of honourable members on both sides of the House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those were her words. I wish also to quote what the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) had to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I also say to Clarrie Millar: It is true, we on this side of the House had a great deal of respect for you while you were in the chair.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        I thought you were a glowing example . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I go to a higher authority, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself, who on that occasion said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I want him--
       </para>
       <para>
        that is Mr Millar--
       </para>
       <para>
        to know that we on this side of the House identify ourselves with all the laudatory comments that were made in respect of him by those nominating and supporting him. He is, in the best sense of the word, a real gentleman. He has both our respect and our affection.
       </para>
       <para>
        These remarks leave little more for me to say. Mr Millar distinguished himself as the Chairman of Committees in two parliaments, and his rulings were always given through a thorough knowledge of the Standing Orders, common sense, his competence and his fairness. He would not be directed in what he should do in the chair by the political masters of this House. Mr Millar sought to maintain the dignity and reputation of this House by exercising that competence and fairness because, above all else, he has a firm belief in the Westminster system. In the proper traditions of Westminster, I ask supporters of the Government to consider carefully the nomination of Mr Millar. To have Clarrie Millar occupy the office of Chairman of Committees would demonstrate to all the people of Australia that this Thirty-fourth Parliament has commenced on the basis of recognising ability above political bias.

We on this side of the House have taken great pleasure for a long time in having her as one of our parliamentary colleagues. I say to new members of this House that they will find no better person in this place than Mrs Child. She can speak with a sense of authority in giving advice on how to go about the business of politics. It is very clear to those outside this Parliament that Mrs Child is a very distinctive person. Women in Australia recognise that she has made a substantial contribution to the conduct of this Parliament and they have great respect for her.

        One of the jobs of people who occupy the chair in this place is to substantially lift the respect in which this place is held by the community.

Mr Speaker, I believe that the remarks that were made earlier today about yourself and those we are making about Mrs Child are substantially important. We have great respect for her and for you. I know that that respect will be exhibited to Mrs Child in this place.

        It is interesting that the Opposition nominated Mr Millar. I know that the Parliament in general has a great deal of regard for Mr Millar, and he is respected by this Parliament. I say to Clarrie that in the conduct of this, the Thirty-fourth Parliament, he will find that sometimes it is not just a question of quality; it is also a question of having the numbers. Today that will be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        To return to the question of quality, there is no doubt that we are making a sensible and sound decision in nominating Mrs Child.

         —Any one of my colleagues who has enjoyed the privilege of working with the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) would welcome the opportunity to support his nomination as Chairman of Committees. His qualifications for the position are without equal. His achievement as Chairman during the terms of successive Fraser governments earned him the respect of all, colleagues and political opponents alike. His reputation has been enhanced since, while serving as a Deputy Chairman. Indeed, his example is one for all Deputy Chairmen to follow and any would be well advised to seek and follow his advice. Clarrie Millar has the ability to chair proceedings in the chamber with the impartiality expected of the holder of that high office, to combine that quality with a duty to his Party and his electorate and to express his views in general debate clearly and with genuine conviction.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        No doubt, the admirable qualities of the honourable member for Wide Bay are derived from his time in the Public Service in the old Postmaster-General's Department, his time as a farmer and not least his wartime service with the Royal Australian Air Force. As a man of exceptional ability, good humour and honour, his performance and reputation in this place probably confer their own tribute. It is a privilege for me to second the nomination of Clarrie Millar for the second highest parliamentary office in this chamber, Chairman of Committees.

By the way she has discharged the duties of the office she has commanded the respect and, I believe, the affection of all honourable members. Secondly, I have very great pleasure in congratulating her because I count her amongst my very close personal friends. She has been a member of this Parliament for a fairly long period. She was here from 1974 to 1975. She has been a member again since 1980. She has held the parliamentary positions of Deputy Chairman of Committees from 21 April 1983 until 28 February 1984 and, as we all know, of Chairman of Committees from 28 February of last year.

        To the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) I say what I said on the last occasion such as this. I have no problems about my quotations being thrown up against me again, but on this occasion I can say, not only personally, but also on behalf of the Government, that the great pleasure we have in voting for Mrs Child and seeing her elected involves no reflection on him. No member in this House is more universally liked and respected than the honourable member for Wide Bay. That is still the case and he should not take the vote as any adverse reflection upon him. I can identify myself with all the things that were said in the honourable member's favour by the mover and seconder of his nomination. But ultimately, as someone behind me said, it is not just quality-which both candidates have-that counts in these situations, but that little additional ingredient-numbers. I wish the honourable member for Wide Bay the best of luck.

She acquitted herself with rare distinction, amid all the expectations of the House, in that rather challenging role of the first woman occupant of the chair. Since that time, I have enjoyed the co-operation and the cordiality of working as one of her Deputy Chairmen of Committees. I wish to put a point to those who may ponder on the wisdom of engaging in a contest when the result is virtually foregone. There is no reflection implicit in that action on any of the candidates, or on the successful candidate. In fact, it fortifies the position of the successful candidate, because it carries a very positive endorsement of the House. The alternative method-uncontested election-invites a degree of presumption that the popularity is as substantial as it would be wished. Today's events prove beyond question or doubt that the incumbency carries the positive endorsement of the House and I wish Mrs Child well in her future term.

       That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 11 January 1985 of the Rt Hon. Sir William John McKell, GCMG, QC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1947 to 1953 and Premier of New South Wales from 1941 to 1947, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.

      <para>
       William John McKell was born at Pambula, New South Wales, on 26 September 1891, the son of Robert, a butcher, and Martha McKell. He moved with his parents to Sydney in 1897. He was educated at Bourke Street, Redfern, Public School but had to leave at the age of 10 to help support his family upon the death of his father. He became an apprentice boilermaker at Morts Dock. He formed an apprentices union and personally argued its case before the New South Wales Arbitration Court. He was Assistant Secretary of the Boilermakers Union from 1915 to 1917 in which year he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Redfern. He remained a member of the New South Wales Parliament for an unbroken term of 30 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the guidance of a former Labor Premier, William Holman, he studied at law and was called to the Bar in 1925. He was Minister for Justice in the Storey Labor Government from 1920 to 1922; Minister for Justice and Assistant Treasurer in the first Lang Government from 1925 to 1927; Minister for Local Government from 1930 to 1931; and Minister for Justice from 1931 to 1932 in the second Lang Government. He became Leader of the Opposition in 1939 and he was Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales from May 1941 until his resignation in February 1947. He was Governor-General of Australia from 1947 to 1953.

       The recital of these basic facts can hardly convey the depth and the richness of a very remarkable career of service to his party, the Australian Labor Party, to the Parliament of New South Wales and to the people of Australia. When it is recalled that the year of his birth, 1891, was also the year of the birth of the Australian Labor Party and that one of his clearest boyhood memories was the proclamation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901, it can be seen that his life encompassed the formative years and the most momentous events of the modern epoch in Australian history. He was a participant in the three great crises of our first half century-the First World War, the Great Depression and the war in the Pacific. The years of his Governor-Generalship covered the years of the post-war transition, from the massive problems of post-war reconstruction to the new immigration program and the beginning of the long period of economic growth of the 1950s and 1960s.

       McKell's premiership of New South Wales embraced the entire period of the war in the Pacific and Australia's years of maximum danger. The people of New South Wales had called upon him and upon the Australian Labor Party for leadership in May 1941. This Parliament of Australia called upon John Curtin and the Australian Labor Party for leadership in October 1941. It meant that, by Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the conditions existed for the creation of a great and effective partnership in the prosecution of Australia's tremendous war effort between the national Government, under Curtin, and the Government of the largest State, under McKell. Curtin was to write to McKell in 1942, in the darkest hour, in these terms, and I quote the letter from Curtin to McKell:

       In this grave crisis in Australia's history the calls by my Government on the New South Wales Government increase hourly and I am greatly heartened in knowing that whenever an appeal has been made to you, immediate response has always been forthcoming with such splendid results.
      </para>
      <para>
       After the burden of the war years and the two most difficult of the immediate post-war years, McKell proposed to retire into private life at the early age of 56. He has recorded that he had no expectations that the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, would ask King George VI to appoint him as the second Australian-born Governor-General, and certainly he did not anticipate the wrath and hostility the appointment caused in certain quarters-a resentment, I might say, almost incomprehensible to the present generation of Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is now part of history that the tremendous personal integrity and natural dignity and strength of character McKell brought to his great office, aided so superbly by his wife Minnie, quickly shamed his partisan critics into silence and, indeed, converted all but the most unregenerate backwoodsmen into admirers. The precedent of Australian Governors-General is now established as an unbreakable principle. In the discharge of his office he adhered scrupulously to the fundamental principle of our parliamentary democracy-that the Governor-General will act, and act alone, on the advice of the elected government. In accepting the advice of the Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, for a double dissolution in 1951, albeit contrary to the expectations of some of his former Labor colleagues, he acted not only with complete propriety; he acted in the only way compatible with the fundamental principles of our democracy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Labor Party has had no greater servant than Bill McKell; but he was a great Party man precisely because he was a great Australian patriot and a great Australian democrat. He had a deep and simple love for Australia and for the Australian people. He had pride in Australia's achievements and unshakable faith in its future. He wrote, in the foreword to his book, entitled Five Critical Years, these words:

       He was referring to the work and the sacrifices of the people of Australia in the war. Now, as we in this Parliament pay our tribute on behalf of the people of Australia, we may ask that question again, rephrasing it only slightly, and ask in these terms: What sort of nation would it be if the people had no pride in the achievements, the career and the life of a great Australian like William John McKell?

I was too young to be actively involved in the criticism my Party heaped on the appointment of William McKell as Governor-General but a man to whom I owe so much for my own career, who served before me in the office I hold today and who served in the seat I represent, was at the forefront of that criticism. I know from personal conversation in the latter stages of his life, as he covered the many and varied tapestries of his own career, that he regretted much of what he said, despite the strong instincts and strong intellectual thought that had motivated it because of what I think the House recognises, in looking back on it, as the firm belief he had in our ties with the United Kingdom. It was not a criticism launched out of some personal motivation; it was intellectually and politically motivated in the real sense of those words.

      <para>
       I feel some pride in standing with the Prime Minister to enjoin the House on behalf of my Party to support so fully the words so ably spoken by the Prime Minister which refer to the rich career of a truly great Australian. He arose from what in those days would have been called a very ordinary background. He was an extraordinary man. The Prime Minister very properly described his career and then added the features that must be added beyond those elements that can be taken from any person's curriculum vitae. He was elected to the Parliament at an extraordinarily early age, having to face in his youth all the difficulties touched on by the Prime Minister. He was elected a Minister at a very early age. That may seem a minor point, but it is a measure of the determination and ability of the man that in his twenties, grappling with the portfolio that he had, he was still able to complete a law degree. I would say that he was the first man to handle efficiently and capably a ministerial portfolio and complete a law degree at the same time. Of course he went on in the 1940s to become a King's Counsel, as the title then was.
      </para>
      <para>
       He was a driving force in the development of the New South Wales Labor Party. His achievements and skills as a hard-headed, practical politician were clearly enormous and it is obvious to me, as one who has studied and discussed the role of those who have served this great nation, that he was in touch with ordinary people, in controversy and out of controversy. I believe that, as the Prime Minister said, he demonstrated during his term as Governor-General a fundamental appreciation of the complex and delicate role of incumbents of that high office. He was a man of vision, a man of persistence and a man of enormous determination. He was an extraordinary man who had an extraordinary career, and I join with the Prime Minister and I am sure every member of this House in extending sympathy to his family.

        —Mr Speaker, on behalf of the National Party of Australia I join in this tribute to the late Right Honourable Sir William McKell and extend to his widow, Lady McKell, and family the deepest sympathy of all of us in the Party. There are but three matters that I want to raise to add to those very eloquent testimonies of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). The first is that it is of interest that in some circles there is criticism of the office which Sir William McKell ultimately held-that is, Governor-General of Australia. It is worth bearing in mind the great distinction he brought to that office and that as the second Australian incumbent he was able to retire from that office and retain his honour and respect in the community. He is looked on now as a very great Australian, not only by those who were members of his party but by all Australians. I trust that in the precedent he set as an Australian Governor-General, by which he was able so effectively to serve our Australian Constitution, there might be some lesson that those who criticise the office and our constitutional system might bear in mind.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The second point is that at 13 years of age he completed his formal education. He commenced work as a boilermaker's apprentice at Morts Dock, and those who look back at the level of education in those days and contrast it with that which most of us have been able to enjoy, will appreciate the enormous dedication and application that men and women of that generation applied. There is little doubt that his appointment, as my colleague has said, as a King's Counsel and his career as a leading counsel at the Bar were a tribute to his own acumen, his own record and his own performance. Although he did not have the opportunity for the formal education that today's generation enjoys, by application and hard work he achieved the highest office in this land. Perhaps in that he could be an example to others.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third point is that, in the application of his job as Governor-General, he undertook a task which must have caused him considerable heartburn. As a Labor Premier and as a man who was very close to the members of his Party-the testimony of the Prime Minister has illustrated this today-one can understand that it would have been a difficult decision for him in 1951, more so because of the earlier criticism of his appointment by Robert Menzies, the then Leader of the Opposition, which criticism no doubt he would have taken personally. But Bill McKell took the decision he believed fit, appropriate and right. As the Prime Minister said, it was without doubt the correct course, following the dictates and the circumstances of the Government of the day. It is very appropriate that we all remember that he did the job according to the way in which he believed he should have undertaken his commission. I believe that it added greatly to his distinction.
      </para>
      <para>
       I thank the Prime Minister for allowing Lady McKell the privilege of retaining the driver whose services Sir William and Lady McKell have enjoyed over recent years. I have had some personal association with them. I know how greatly Lady McKell appreciates that gesture. It is very difficult for people at her stage of life, and I know that she values greatly the fact that Andrew Donaghey is still able to care for her. At a personal level I extend to Lady McKell and her family my deepest sympathy on the death of a very great Australian.

        —I too join in supporting the motion of condolence to the widow and family of the late Sir William McKell. I do not do it from the point of view of any position I hold but more from the point of view of a friendship which extended over a period of years. Of course, one would support all that has been said and, in supporting it, one would recognise the outstanding qualities of a great Australian. I am aware of the fact that Sir William McKell was once a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the area of Redfern, which is part of my Federal electorate. That in itself tells a story, a story of disadvantage. The people who lived in Redfern in 1891 were disadvantaged, as are those living there now. McKell's widowed mother had to struggle through his formative years when he could get only a limited education. But his life shows that ability cannot be restrained even by poverty. It shows also that the Australian way of life, despite its defect, at times, particularly through political action, allows those with ability to do something very constructive for Australia. McKell did that. As has been said, he did it by educating himself. He eventually became a King's Counsel. He was admitted to the Bar of New South Wales at the age of 34-no mean achievement when he started off in Redfern and left school at the age of 13. There was something about the man. From my point of view, very fortunately, there was a continued close association until the very last days.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am very mindful of the panegyric delivered at his funeral by Archbishop Marcus Loane. He paid a great tribute to the man for what he said was his outstanding interest in Australia being strengthened as a nation. He mentioned how McKell, as a boy, had watched the procession which was taking place through the streets of Sydney commemorating the birth of the Commonwealth. At the age of nine he made a decision to play a part in strengthening this nation. He did that in a number of ways. Kosciusko National Park of a million and a quarter acres is due to Sir William McKell. The Snowy Mountains scheme was due to the co-operation between McKell and Chifley. They had a vision for Australia. They did not suffer from any cultural inferiority. It was always their view that Australians could do it, as they had always been able to do it. Honourable members will remember that McKell, when he was leading New South Wales, resisted a suggestion that the governors of New South Wales should come from overseas. He insisted on an Australian being appointed as State Governor. I think it shows the vision of the man.
      </para>
      <para>
       My daughter, who is a nurse, had the rather sad duty of assisting Sir William in hospital in his declining times. He was an outstanding person even there. He could bear illness with a lot of fortitude. In a more pleasant vein, in recent years he used to come to the Redfern Returned Services League Day march, even though he was over 90 years of age, whilst the Redfern diggers celebrated-no mean feat at any time. They enjoyed his company and he theirs. I remember on one occasion-this adds a bit of new matter-he took great pride in telling me how the Australian Labor Party won in 1941 despite the problems with factions, which we now have again. He made an arrangement with the Party executive of New South Wales that he alone would select the candidates and he did that. The Labor Party was very successful indeed and won handsomely. There is no precedent here for anybody else to do that. I make the point that the man had vision and capacity because, in the selection of those candidates, he was able to bring city and country together. He won in a number of country seats because the candidates were directly related to the issues which were important at the time. He was well ahead of his time in law reform matters. In his period of New South Wales Labor, legislation was introduced to give pensions to the miners who suffered from silicosis and to improve workers' compensation. There was also action in respect of improving consumer protection, particularly from the point of view of the moneylenders Act, the hire purchase Act and legislation in industrial areas for shorter working hours and leave. All those matters, which were well ahead of Sir William's time, were taken care of by legislation. We, particularly those of us in the Labor Party, owe Sir William McKell a great debt, but more importantly, the nation owes him a great debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       As was said by all the previous speakers, as Governor-General he recognised his duty to this nation. He recognised that the best way to be effective in that very honourable position was always to follow the advice of his Ministers, and he did that. I am very pleased to see that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) recognised that particular attribute, which can only add strength to the nation. If that course is not followed in the future we can understand the divisiveness that will occur. I welcome the opportunity to make these few remarks because Sir William McKell was a very great Australian. He is sadly missed by all, particularly the people of Redfern.

       That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Mrs Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India, and expresses deep sympathy to her family in their bereavement and that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the Australian Parliament to the Government of India.

       Mr Speaker, the death of Indira Gandhi was a shameful, wanton act of terrorism. It was a tragedy of the worst kind for India, a tragedy deplored by all Australians and, of course, by everyone in this House. Mrs Gandhi was a great leader, one whose courage, strength and guidance will be greatly missed, not only by the people of India but by people throughout the world. Mrs Gandhi was well known to my predecessors-Mr Fraser and Mr Whitlam-and to me. She was greatly respected by each of us. All who saw her leadership in action recognised the ability she brought to one of the most demanding jobs in the world, the head of the largest democracy on earth. India under Indira Gandhi's leadership made enormous progress against the greatest odds in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing and science. India has become one of the 10 largest economies in the world today. It has developed a strong technological and manufacturing base and, to a degree almost unthinkable 20 years ago, has achieved a notable measure of self-reliance in agriculture.
      </para>
      <para>
       India has also become a major political force, both in the Indian Ocean region and beyond. India has long been a leading nation amongst developing countries. Under Mrs Gandhi, India took on the increased responsibilities of leadership of the non-aligned movement. At the time of Mrs Gandhi's death, India also chaired the Commonwealth. Through these major roles Indian statesmanship was apparent to all. As a leader Indira Gandhi deserved the greatest admiration and respect. Following Mrs Gandhi's death her son Rajiv was appointed Prime Minister. Subsequently, in an election held in December, he was overwhelmingly endorsed in this position. I am confident that under his leadership the traditions of a democratic, non-aligned India and its role in the Indian Ocean region and globally as a force for peace and progress will continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Government is moving to give greater recognition to India's political and economic influence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) will be visiting India later this year, probably in May. Substantial upgrading of the relationship is in prospect, as indeed it is with all the countries of the South Asian region. I know that this is a development Mrs Gandhi would have welcomed. Shortly before her death I extended an invitation to Indira Gandhi to visit Australia. I have expressed to Mr Rajiv Gandhi the hope that he will find an opportunity to take up the invitation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indira Gandhi's passing is of the greatest regret to all of us. All Australians, all members of this House, will, I know, join the Government and me in expressing profoundest sympathy at India's great loss.

The democratic system is a precious commodity, and Australia and India are members of that proud family of democracies. We share values, traditions and a belief in the rule of law, which, of course, makes Mrs Gandhi's tragic death all the more distressing. The political assassination of a democratically elected leader is a crime not only against the individual but equally against every citizen in that country and in the free world. It is a source of great satisfaction to us that nevertheless democracy has prevailed over the threat of the gun in India and that the return of a democratically elected leader has been effected.

       Mr Speaker, I knew Indira Gandhi well. I had dealings with her on numerous occasions, particularly during the period in which I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, when she was both in and out of office, through the Commonwealth of Nations, through the United Nations, regionally and bilaterally. As the world knows, she was a woman of very great strength and character. She had a fierce determination and commitment to the poor and oppressed of India and to the developing world. She was a major international figure. The pursuit of a new international economic order, international peace and stability were part of her vision for a fairer and more just world community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indira Gandhi's life and career spanned momentous events in the development of India as a nation. She was intimately involved in the country's struggle for independence through her family. She inherited a famous political mantle and abundantly demonstrated her own leadership qualities over three decades. Her periods as Prime Minister were not without controversy but her political endurance was a tribute to her sense of purpose and her vision. That vision and sense of purpose were able to bring together a country of breathtaking contrast and diversity. Under her leadership India became a modern nation. Traditional cultural ways exist alongside nuclear power programs and space research. Her greatest legacy is that she left the nation united in its sense of loss and determined to continue the course of modernisation and justice she set. On behalf of the Opposition I extend my deepest sympathy to her family and to the people of India. Her presence in the international community is already sorely missed.

       Mrs Indira Gandhi, whom I too knew well, was a lady of great charm. She was a very personable lady and yet one of great strength. There is little doubt that during her term India benefited enormously from the guidance that she gave to her people. I believe it a great tragedy that a figure of that ilk should have been assassinated in such a way. The nation seems, remarkably, to have been able to gather together the reins of democracy. I believe there is enormous comfort to her son in knowing that so many people admire him and the task that he is doing.

I had the sad distinction of being asked to represent the Australian Government at the funeral of Mrs Gandhi; I accompanied His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady Stephen. What has been said by previous speakers was epitomised by the fact that people from all over the world were assembled at that funeral. When one looked across the many hundreds of leaders of nations, one saw that they had great respect for the work that had been done by Indira Gandhi. That work required a great deal of sacrifice. Her assassination was a very cruel and bloody affair. It probably showed that there were tensions, as there always can be in any nation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Something that was mentioned by previous speakers and which is worth while mentioning again is that democracy is very precious. Even some of the leaders who were there, and who perhaps do not have democracy in their countries, would have recognised and been aware of the fact that democracy has an inherent strength which means that people can participate in the governing of their country. To that extent, perhaps Indira Gandhi paid the penalty of minority groups not necessarily supporting what she was about.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also met Indira Gandhi at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Jamaica in 1975. In that conference format, one could see the strength of this woman, talking about the values of democracy in a world in which the preservation of democracy is always very difficult.
      </para>
      <para>
       We wish her son every success in a very difficult job. India has problems of poverty and many other problems that can bedevil any nation, particularly one which has a population of 750 million. It has been no small feat to guarantee the survival of democracy in India for the period that it has survived. Its continuation will require a great deal of effort and support. Australia will give that support. I add that, from the point of view of democracy in this nation, it also behoves us to guarantee that this is continued with the greatest of strength because everybody looks at the democratic structure not for its strength but for its weakness. India is proving the point that it can work and we wish it well in all its future endeavours.

        —I add briefly my support to the remarks of previous speakers. I had the privilege of having several long discussions with Mrs Gandhi, both in her office in New Delhi and in Melbourne during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. In New Delhi, we discussed the agenda for that meeting. That discussion inevitably roamed far and wide in terms of the world's problems and the North-South dialogue which was then in focus and which should still be so.

       In Melbourne, I was assigned to escort Mrs Gandhi daily during her stay in Australia. That enabled me to get to know her quite well and to see not only all the characteristics mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and other speakers, but also her warmth, her simplicity, her humility and in many ways her great frailty. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, she was a strong character but she was such a physically frail person and she had a great gentle quality. I accompanied her to one particular gathering of Australians of Indian extraction, which was most moving. One could picture her in her own garden, making herself available to her countrymen as she did frequently. On this occasion people of all ages and backgrounds mixed with her freely as if with a mother figure who was very much their equal, their friend and former compatriot. On the occasion of her death, as with the death of Lord Mountbatten, I saw the real tragedy and the real cowardice and cruelty of those who take the course of assassinating such a person.

      <para>
       Her political opponents found her an uncompromising person and had some harsh things to say about her. She understood politics, democracy and India, but her loss is not just to India but to the world because of the vast experience she had stored up. Her knowledge of the Middle East and other parts of the world would be so valuable today in the international conferences and fora of which she was so sceptical. She was rightly sceptical of them, but she also recognised that they were the most sensible means towards the ends of world peace and equality for which she strove. Her loss is that of India, even though her son is well entrenched and has made a good beginning. Her loss is also a loss to the world. I join other members in mourning her passing.

        —Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of this condolence motion. In July 1981, I had the opportunity to lead a delegation, I believe the last delegation of this Parliament to Pakistan and India. On that occasion Mrs Gandhi gave very generously of her time to meet with the members of that delegation. I believe that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) is the only member of this House now who would be able to attest to the way in which she addressed very many difficult and controversial issues and was able and willing to discuss them with us in a way which I found very generous. I looked through the report and noted that it contained references to India's nuclear program, a matter which interested many members of this Parliament; Indian-Soviet relations; the difficult question of Afghanistan; the Indian economy, particularly inflation; land reform; and, of course, the question of the return of Pakistan to the Commonwealth.

       I was particularly impressed with the way in which she was able to assist us in understanding a great deal more about India. She made it very clear to us that all the experts who were able to assist India were not really scattered throughout the world. She regarded Indians as the real experts because they had the experience to bring to bear on the enormous problems that India faces. I can recall her asking us, in a lighter moment, how long we were to spend in India. I said it was to be nine days. She responded lightly: 'Oh, that is good. Most come for two and then think they can write a book.' As I said, she was very generous to us as a delegation. She was a great leader who is and will be very genuinely missed. I join with my colleagues in expressing on behalf of the members who have visited India our deepest regret. I note that in our report we suggested that under the auspices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association a special liaison group of members interested in Indian-Australian relations ought to be formed. That might be another matter the Prime Minister might add to his list.

       Dudley Erwin had a long and distinguished career in this House. Elected to the seat of Ballarat in 1955, he retired from the House in 1975. From February to November 1969 he served as Minister for Air and Leader of the House. He was a member of several committees and was Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications. He also served as Government Whip from February 1967 to February 1969.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dudley Erwin was deeply involved in the turbulent politics of the late 1960s. His comments at the time of his dismissal from the Ministry for Air will stand as among the more colourful and memorable bons mots uttered by one from this place. Dudley Erwin's interests were wide-ranging. He was a dedicated life member of the Returned Services League. He was also a vigorous supporter of small business and served as President of the Australian Association of Independent Businesses. Dudley Erwin's passing we all regret. To his widow and children we convey our sincerest sympathy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, we were also saddened by the death of Sir William Haworth. Sir William originally served in the Victorian Legislative Assembly between 1937 and 1945. For a brief period late in 1945 he was Minister for Health and Minister of Housing in the then Victorian Government. In 1949 Sir William was elected to the Federal seat of Issacs, a seat he held until his retirement in September 1969. Sir William was a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1959 to 1966. From 1960 to 1969 he was Temporary, later Deputy, Chairman of Committees. Throughout his time in this House Sir William demonstrated a keen interest in the processes of the Parliament. International affairs also attracted his concentrated attention. On the occasion of his death I am sure that all members of this House will join me in conveying sincerest sympathy to Sir William's widow, Freda.
      </para>
      <para>
       Leslie Irwin is another whose death saddens us all. Leslie Irwin was elected to the seat of Mitchell in this House in 1963. He retained the seat until 1972. As a member of this House, he served on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise and the House of Representatives Select Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits. He was also a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Before joining this House, Leslie Irwin had had a distinguished record of service in the First World War. For 33 years he had also worked as a manager in the Bank of New South Wales. Leslie Irwin was a dedicated and conscientious member whose passing I know we all regret. His family has our sincerest sympathy.

        —On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I wish to record profound regret over the passing of all the men mentioned, all of whom I served with in this Parliament. Dudley Erwin, of course, is remembered, as the Prime Minister mentioned, for the phrase he used after ceasing to be a member of the Gorton Ministry, as Minister for Air. Dudley is remembered by me for many other elements of his distinguished and long political career. It was quite an introduction when I first came to this Parliament to share an office, dare I remind him, with Senator Chipp, now leader of the Australian Democrats. Our neighbours, sharing an office next door to us, were Sir James Killen, as he now is, and Dudley Erwin. Honourable members can imagine the distractions that both Senator Chipp and I had to suffer on many a day and night.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Dudley, of course, served as Minister for Air, as Leader of the House, as Government Whip and as the honourable member for Ballarat. He had extensive service on both House and joint committees, including the chairmanship of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications. Those honourable members who take careful note of what their staff have on their desks would probably find in their offices an Australian Government Style Manual. It may seem irrelevant to some; however it was quite a breakthrough. It has been praised by all those associated with the production of material, et cetera, on behalf of the Government and is of assistance to secretaries. Dudley Erwin worked tirelessly as Chairman of that Committee. I know that well after the time he retired, though few may have known of it, he was distinctly proud of the contribution he made in the production of that manual, which has been praised in many countries around the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dudley represented the Commonwealth Parliament and the nation overseas on a number of occasions, including through his membership of the Australian delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1961. Dudley would not mind my saying that he perhaps charted a course for some members of this Parliament. He was away for much-if not all-of the period of the 1961 election and he shared with me the doubtful honour of being one of only two candidates in Australia to increase their vote in that election. However, I was unsuccessful in my endeavours to enter this place on that occasion, while Dudley was returned with an increased majority. There is a message for some in that.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dudley was well prepared for the Air Ministry, having served with distinction as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Australian Air Force in the Second World War. He served as a navigator in the south-west Pacific and, as a member of No. 31 Squadron, he took part in some most successful operations against the Japanese air force. As the Prime Minister mentioned, he was a life member of the Returned Services League. Prior to entering Parliament, Dudley Erwin was an electrical radio engineer and a farmer. We knew him well as the member for Ballarat and also as the proprietor of Craigs Hotel, that great hotel in Ballarat. He was a keen supporter of small business, serving as President of the Australian Association of Independent Businesses, and he made a great contribution, not only to small business, but particularly to the Liberal Party with his diligent membership of this Parliament, his representation of Ballarat and his keenness as a supporter of the philosophy of liberalism. To his wife Gwenda and his children, I extend the sympathy of Opposition members.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn also with very deep regret to the passing of Sir William Haworth. I served with him in this Parliament. He had a parliamentary career that spanned more than 30 years. For a time he was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and he participated in several overseas delegations. Before coming into this Parliament he was a member of the Victorian State Parliament-he was a member of the Legislative Assembly for Albert Park between 1937 and 1945-and, as the Prime Minister mentioned, he served briefly as Minister for Health and Minister of Housing in one of the many governments during that time in Victorian politics.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sir William Haworth also served with distinction in the Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East during the Second World War. He was very active in the management of the Liberal Party. He served beyond the council of the Victorian division; he was a member of conservative bodies before the Liberal Party was actually formed and was one of the earlier members upon the formation of the Liberal Party which was duly constituted in 1945. We were very proud when Bill received his knighthood for his long and distinguished career in Australian politics in both the State and Federal parliaments. He gave great service to my Party and great and diligent service to this Parliament. On behalf of members of the Opposition I extend sympathy to Lady Haworth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Similarly on behalf of the Opposition, I extend sympathy to the family of Les Irwin who died on 28 January. Like Dudley Erwin, Les Irwin served with distinction in the air force. His service was in the Great War-with the Australian Flying Corps in France. He was first elected as Liberal member for Mitchell, New South Wales in 1963, and he was returned again in 1966 and 1969. He was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, as well as two select committees. Les Irwin fought hard for the people of Mitchell. He was prepared to stand up for them, regardless of who the opponent was. I was always interested to serve in this Parliament with him and I note his passing with sadness.

He represented an area in Sydney which has changed dramatically in the last 20 or 30 years. He can best be remembered in this place by a question he asked one day. He rose and asked: 'How is the waterfront?'. The brevity of that question was indicative of the man. He was a man of few words but he left a mark in this place.

The period in which he began his parliamentary career was, as honourable members know, one of enormous turbulence for the Labor Party. It was during that period when it was in disarray that he was able to win his seat. For some time he was dependent upon the preferences of the Democratic Labor Party. Probably it was something of a measure of the man that as the voters tended to resolve their allegiances and as the DLP declined, Dudley Erwin was able to gain a majority in his own right. There is no doubt at all that this was in no small measure due to his own endeavours on behalf of the constituents of Ballarat.

       Dudley Erwin is remembered by very many people in Ballarat, especially, perhaps, by the older generation, with a great deal of affection. That affection spans party boundaries. He also served his country with distinction during the Second World War. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940 and remained in the Air Force until 1945. He fought in Beaufighters as a navigator and, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated, in a number of very famous battles. He retired from the Air Force as a flight lieutenant.

       I also saw a lot of Dudley Erwin after he retired from Parliament, because he did work on behalf of people in the film industry and he was in my office quite a lot making representations on their behalf. It appears that his heart attack occurred after leaving my office. I understand that he collapsed against the wall outside my office, and from there transport home was arranged for him. So my contact with him was indeed a sad one at the finish. I understand he died a couple of days later. As someone who has just had an illness, I know what an awful experience he must have gone through.

       I think that Dudley Erwin was the finest type of local member. He did a wonderful job as the member for Ballarat. Dudley often said to me that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), who has now succeeded him, had followed him in his own pattern in looking after his electorate, and Dudley believed that his successor would be there as the member for Ballarat for as long as he wanted to remain in Parliament. So he was also a good judge of parliamentarians. I am saddened by his passing and I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.

        —I wish to pay tribute to the life of Leslie Herbert Irwin and his service to the nation. Les Irwin was known as Mr Blacktown in the western suburbs of Sydney. He served there for many years as the manager of the Bank of New South Wales, his prime purpose being to assist small market gardeners, farmers and new home buyers to make their purchases. He built a tremendous reputation through the western suburbs of Sydney as a caring, thoughtful person and he was heavily involved in community life. He served the bank as manager for 33 years and retired at the age of 65 years. He was elected to the Parliament as the member for Mitchell at that age and served this Parliament for nine years. He was a man of great drive and vitality.

       His war service started in 1916 when he enlisted and, as has been mentioned, he was one of those responsible for ferrying aircraft from Great Britain into France. He flew great classic aircraft such as the Sopwith Camel and the Sopwith Pup and was known as a great flyer. He was decorated within the last 10 years by the Government of France with the Legion of Honour for his contribution to that nation during the Second World War. He was given further recognition by being awarded the European Cross in 1968. Such was the contribution that Les Irwin made to world peace.

       He was a great sportsman also. He was a great footballer and in latter years a great trotting man. He named his horses after his electorate; Mitchell Victory and Mitchell Pride were two that I remember. In Parliament Les Irwin was dedicated to private enterprise. One sentence in his maiden speech says:

       I believe that only under free enterprise can man achieve his greatest potential.

       The themes of many of his speeches were in that vein. He was a fervent anti-communist and resented socialism in all forms, and he frequently said so. He was a colourful character, and the story is told that at 5 o'clock one morning, after an all night sitting of this Parliament, Les Irwin walked down the front steps of Parliament House with great zest and gusto singing, with good voice, 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'. That is the sort of man Les Irwin was. He was loved by the people of the western suburbs, as the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), who is trying to interject, would realise. He was also recognised by Lions International. He was an honorary freeman of the City of Blacktown and on two occasions he was recognised by Her Majesty the Queen, with the MBE and later the CBE. I know that members of this House will join me and my family and all electors in the electorate of Mitchell in sympathising with his wife, Maudi, and family on his passing.

        —I ran against Bill Hawarth twice, in 1955 and in 1958. I draw attention to the fact that he was one of those comparatively few people who have served at all three levels of public life in Australia. A number of members of this House have served at two levels, but comparatively few have served at all three. He was a South Melbourne councillor from 1932 to 1938 and then, as has been said, he was in the State Parliament of Victoria for eight years. Of course, four of those eight years were served overseas in the Army, during which time he served at Tobruk. In those days when there were very rapid turnovers of governments in Victoria he served in the Macfarlan Government for seven weeks, between October and November 1945. That Government was made up almost entirely of a group of dissident Liberals-a group of the kind which I understand is still in existence.

       He served for six years in municipal government and eight years in the State Parliament and then he did a 20-year stretch in this Parliament. He was one of the last of the nineteen forty-niners. Sir William McMahon was the prima donna assoluta in that regard. He was the last to go. I think I am correct in saying-I hope I do not leave anyone out-that the only honourable members in this House who served with Bill Haworth are the Minister for Territories (Mr Scholes), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden), the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson).

There is a great deal about Bill Haworth in the recent publication entitled The Howson Diaries: The Life of Politics. It contains a lot of information about his role as a back room man in the Liberal Party. He was a disappointed aspirant to the Speakership on a number of occasions. But he lived to the great age of 80 years. It is because I think he has been largely forgotten that I felt some obligation to remember him today.

        —The death of two former senators is to be noted following this motion of condolence for three former members. A common thread that runs throughout the history of the two former senators and three former members of the House of Representatives is that they all donned this nation's uniform at some stage in their lives. The late Senator Lacey served at the very end of the First World war. Dudley Erwin, Sir William Haworth and Les Irwin contributed either in the First World War or the Second World War. Dudley Erwin frequently came to see me in my office. I know that he appreciated the courtesies that were extended by you, Mr Speaker, and your predecessor, Sir Billy Snedden. I guess that the best advice one could give to former members is that they should make their lives away from Canberra because it is very difficult for former members to stay away from this place. Both you, Mr Speaker, and your predecessor made Dudley Erwin feel very much at home.

       There is one story in regard to the late Les Irwin which is widely accepted as fact in this place. It took place in either 1963 or 1966. Les Irwin, having served in the First World War, was definitely no chicken when elected to this place. Indeed, he would have been eligible for the age pension when he entered this Parliament. At a time when he was sick, the Australian Labor Party put around in the seat of Mitchell a very cruel rumour that he had died. Les Irwin sought to correct that impression by getting on a bed in the back of a truck which was driven around the electorate of Mitchell with a big sign on it which stated 'Les Irwin is alive'. That is how he created more publicity for himself. If that story is inaccurate, I hope that nobody ever spoils it. I believe it to be true. That story paints its own picture about that very special man.

      <para>
       Les Irwin and Edward Gough Whitlam got on very well together. I remember Les Irwin being most strident in his attacks on the up and coming Leader of the Opposition who was later to become Prime Minister. Les never left him alone, even after E. G. Whitlam became Prime Minister. I noted today that the former Prime Minister was in the Senate listening to the Governor-General's Speech. I could not help but reflect on the friendly comments that they made to each other in this place in years gone by. Sir William Haworth was 77 or 78 years of age at the time of his death.

I remember his attempt to be elected Speaker. He was a very quiet man but he was also a man who had distinguished State service in that he was serving his country in the Middle East when he was re-elected to the Victorian Parliament. Maybe the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) would have a greater knowledge of history, but I believe that Mr Blain, a former honourable member for the Northern Territory, was a prisoner of war at the time he was elected to this Parliament. Bill Haworth, who served in Tobruk, was in a similar position to the extent that he was elected to the Victorian Parliament whilst he was away on war service. He received the same treatment as Churchill, in that immediately at the end of the war Churchill lost and so did Bill Haworth. This was the strange way that Australians treated serving members of Parliament at that time.

       I was here at the time of former Senator Lacey who was a Labor senator. He died at 85 years of age. He left this place in about 1971, which would have been four years after I came to this Parliament. Finally, I wish to make a brief reference to Major-General Wordsworth, also a Liberal, who served in this place. When we start to read the history of some of the former members we can dip our lids to their achievements in their day. Perhaps we are even more privileged to serve here than we really appreciate because a lot of truly great Australians have gone before us. I say to the surviving families of those five people: May your sorrow be softened somewhat by it being known that you were associated with a group of Australians of all political persuasions who contributed a lot to this country of ours, both in time of peace and in time of war.
