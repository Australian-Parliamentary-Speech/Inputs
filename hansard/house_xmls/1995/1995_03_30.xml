        —Yesterday the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) raised as a matter of privilege comments reportedly made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in respect of the Speaker, and me as Deputy Speaker. The honourable member quoted from provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, and he presented copies of media reports referring to the remarks allegedly made by the Prime Minister.

        Section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 abolished the previous offence of contempt by defamation by providing that words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against the House by reason only that the words or acts are defamatory. It is still possible, however, for conduct, including the use of words, to constitute a contempt if it amounts or is intended or is likely to amount to an improper interference with the free exercise by a house or a committee of its authorities or functions or with the free performance by a member of the member's duty as a member.

        The honourable member's complaint puts me in a difficult position in that I am one of the members who have been subject to the alleged attempted intimidation. Despite this difficulty, as Acting Speaker I am required to give a decision as to whether in my opinion a prima facie case has been made out. Having considered the arguments of the honourable member for Flinders, I have to advise the House that I do not believe anything improper has occurred or that there is evidence of an attempt to intimidate either the Speaker or me.

        The House is indeed a robust place, and it is no doubt unlikely that any occupant of the chair will be immune from criticism outside the chamber in respect of his or her performance in the House. I believe, however, that it would only be in exceptional circumstances that criticism of the occupant of the chair would give rise to a substantive issue of privilege or contempt. I do not believe that on this occasion there is prima facie evidence of a breach of privilege or contempt, so I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion on the matter. I call the honourable member for Flinders, by indulgence.

        —Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I appreciate that so early in the day today we have had the benefit of your views on the matter that I raised yesterday. Given your remarks yesterday, I suppose that I was not surprised at the outcome. It is not a ruling that you have made, and that curtails our opportunities to take the matter further today. I am disappointed in the manner in which you have approached this particular issue. You say that you considered the arguments. With great respect, Mr Acting Speaker, you conspicuously did not consider the arguments because you did not give me an opportunity to put the arguments yesterday. You specifically said that all I could do was to table the documents supporting the submission. You specifically upheld a point of order from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) which prevented my putting to you the case that I believed provided a firm foundation for the argument that I thought ought to have been considered by you in a more favourable light.

        The opposition raised the matter yesterday not just in light of the particular remarks that were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to you and, in his absence, to the Speaker but also in light of the conduct of question time and the government's approach to the proceedings of the House.

        I suppose it has long been a complaint from oppositions that they do not get a fair go in the parliament. I suppose it is also true that the public has a fairly cynical view of our complaints about conduct of the proceedings. But the fact is—and you ought to know this, Mr Acting Speaker, given your family background—that standards in this parliament have deteriorated significantly.

        Let me just remind members of some incidents last year. Following the 1993 election, we had a change in the speakership. I suppose we were hopeful and optimistic that a change in the speakership would see a lifting of standards in the parliament. I note that back on 4 May 1993 a newspaper article states that the new Speaker:

       The last Parliament was largely a farce because of the mismanagement of the then Speaker, Leo McLeay. Mr Keating's bonds with Mr McLeay meant that no amount of inept or partisan chairmanship by Mr McLeay could count against him. Mr McLeay will be replaced today by Stephen Martin. Mr Martin has an opportunity to restore the dignity of the chamber. If he is to take it up, it will be primarily by restraining the Government rather than by keeping the Opposition down. The great possibility coming from the Martin appointment is that he is the first Speaker in 17 years to have higher political ambitions. Whether he can achieve them depends on his performance; the more the chairman and the less the cheer leader, the more likely he is to prosper.

       Because of this, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Stephen Martin, should resign from his position—in accordance with the Cope precedent—following the ruthless and humiliating action by the Prime Minister to use the Labor Party's majority in the House of Representatives to vote down new television broadcast rules which had been announced by Mr Martin only 18 hours earlier. The effect of the Prime Minister's action is to destroy the credibility of the Speaker's position. The implication is that the Speaker—who represents all MPs—must tailor his reforms to fit what is deemed to be the interest of the Government.

      <para>
       That was said in October 1993. My concern, and the reason we raised the matter yesterday, is that the reports of the Prime Minister's behaviour coming out of this week's caucus meeting fit exactly within the criteria and the concerns expressed by that editorial. In other words, the impression clearly is obtained that the Prime Minister exerts his influence and authority over you as a member of the caucus to ensure that he gets the results he wants in the parliament. That, of course, brings the parliament into disrepute.

        I do not say much about the substance of the Prime Minister's concerns. It was quite incredible. It was a case of the wolf blaming the sheep for him to be attacking the Speaker.

        But, leaving that aside, our concern is with the proper functioning of the parliament and the maintaining of some order in and respect for the high office of Speaker. Not for our own party political interests but for the sake of a well-functioning democracy, it is important that the office of Speaker be accorded the respect which it is due.

        I refer to your attendance at the caucus meeting earlier this week. The fact of the matter is that, when Sir Billy Snedden was the Speaker, he did not attend Liberal Party parliamentary meetings or caucus meetings. The reason he did not was that he was keen to ensure, as much as possible within our party political system, that he was seen to operate as an independent Speaker.

        The one thing I would agree with the Prime Minister on—the sad truth of the matter—is that no Speaker since Sir Billy Snedden has matched the standards which he set for independence as the Speaker. That was the Prime Minister's remark. I would not suggest, however, that you take any notice of his injunction to you that people ought to be thrown out of the parliament more regularly. In fact, it was because he had a lot of authority and was held in respect by most members of the parliament that the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, did not have to throw people out.

Harry Jenkins was Speaker for around three years and he averaged three a year. Joan Child was Speaker for 18 months and she averaged nearly one a month. Leo McLeay was Speaker for three and a bit years and he averaged one every three months. The current Speaker has averaged seven ejections in less than two years.

        It is a sad reflection on the parliament and on the way the Labor Party treats the parliament that the standards have degenerated. A sort of philosophical underpinning of that is that the Labor Party has long taken the view that, if you get the numbers, basically it is a winner takes all proposition, that you can use your numbers and the end justifies the means.

        You have never accepted one of the great principles upon which our democracy is founded; that is, the principle of the balance of power and a system of checks and balances. It is our view on this side of the parliament that the institution of the parliament and the way the parliament is run are a check and a balance against the abuse of executive power. Even though we may not have the numbers, we do have the conventions, the practices and the great traditions of this parliament to operate as a check against the abuses of people like the Prime Minister.

        It is a sad day when we read in the papers how you have been bounced around the caucus by a Prime Minister so that he can dictate to you the way in which you operate as the Speaker. This goes right down to the swearing in of Brendan Smyth. I was told this morning about it and I presume it is the case—someone one can deny it if it is not. Brendan Smyth on Saturday won a great by-election. The precedent is that, if the writs are declared when the House is sitting, you get sworn in at 3 o'clock in the full glare of the publicity so that the Prime Minister can get up and congratulate you.

       Clearly, from the terms of that motion, it is a very serious matter indeed. I think we all realise that parliament is a robust place and we expect to give and take a fair bit. I think, by any measure, the actions of Senator Baume last week in the Senate went beyond the reasonable bounds of behaviour; indulging in what, by any other person, would be a criminal action and, in fact, which may be criminal action by Senator Baume himself.

        Last Thursday, in the adjournment debate, Senator Baume got up at 7.40 p.m.—right at the end of the parliamentary sitting day—and, in his terms, `dropped a bucket' on the Independent member for Manly in the New South Wales state parliament, Dr Peter Macdonald, just two days before the state election in which Dr Macdonald was a candidate.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The nature of the bucket was that there was a letter from the Australian Taxation Office to Dr Macdonald regarding his tax affairs which followed a tax audit. It was a private letter from the tax office to Dr Macdonald, advising him of substantial adjustments to his tax assessment for the years 1984 to 1988 which considerably increased his taxable income for all of those years, thereby requiring him to pay substantial additional tax. The letter from the tax office also contained his tax file number, divulgement of which is a criminal offence. Altogether, this was a particularly nasty, disgraceful and appalling piece of conduct.

      <para first-indent="16">

        Why did Senator Baume do it? According to his remarks in the Senate, he did it because he expected that Dr Macdonald's supporters were about to `drop a bucket' on the Liberal candidate for the seat of Manly in the election that followed two days later. He was simply retaliating in advance, as it were. In expectation that this was going to happen, he was making sure that he got in and had a bucket dropped on Dr Macdonald. Of course, no such bucket was dropped on the Liberal candidate. So the action that he was seeking to counteract in his explanation is an action which never occurred.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Manly Daily
        </emphasis>
        was not going to proceed with its intention. So we have him assuming an intention on the part of the

        </emphasis>
        to do some heinous act in relation to the Liberal candidate and then saying that he was not aware that the paper was not going to proceed with this intention that he somehow assumed was going to be there. It all sounds very implausible.

Even if he had good reason for his expected belief about what may be about to occur—and he gave no evidence for that whatever—to put it at its very simplest: two wrongs do not make a right. In any case, the wrong he was seeking to counteract never occurred.

There is more emphasis on the fact that, simply by holding the information—obtained from whatever source—about that person's tax file number, an offence has possibly been committed.

        Senator Baume's action is obviously exceedingly serious. It undoubtedly amounts to disgraceful behaviour and, indeed, criminal behaviour, for which Senator Baume relies on parliamentary privilege for protection. His action amounts to criminal behaviour for which any other person could be up for two years in gaol, a $10,000 fine or both. In fact, the issue really is whether parliamentary privilege extends to cover Senator Baume for holding and maintaining this number.

        Senator Baume's attitude to this has been to not apologise for the release of Dr Macdonald's tax information. He gave the excuse that it was only an intended retaliation for something that may have occurred but, in fact, never did. Senator Baume has expressed ignorance that the documents contained a tax file number. He said the documents referred to a file number and had `our reference' rather than `tax file number' or `TFN' on them. He said that, when he realised the documents contained a tax file number, he acted to have it removed from the documents—that is, after the documents had been tabled in the Senate and at least three journalists had obtained copies of them.

        Clearly, Senator Baume should not have tabled the documents with the tax file number on them. In his desperation to drop a bucket on Dr Macdonald, Senator Baume was not concerned about the impact on Dr Macdonald's privacy. He should have realised that a file number from the tax office could well be a tax file number, and he should have removed it from the documents before tabling them. But he did not do so. It should also be noted in this connection that, just by receiving and holding the documents with the tax file number on them, Senator Baume would appear to have breached the Taxation Administration Act. Holding information is an offence and revealing it is another offence.

        It is also interesting to consider who supplied this information. Senator Baume has not said how he obtained these documents, but whoever gave them to him was clearly acting illegally by holding Dr Macdonald's tax file number and revealing it to Senator Baume. Whoever gave that information to Senator Baume has committed a criminal offence. There is absolutely no doubt about that.

It has been one week since this happened and, as far as I am aware, there has not been one statement from the Leader of the Opposition condemning Senator Baume's actions. That is the most extraordinary thing. You would think that honest John would be very concerned about the fact that one of his parliamentary colleagues had undertaken criminal action in the parliament and had cooperated with people who had undertaken criminal action by giving him that information.

        When the tax file number issue came before this parliament in 1988 there was an enormous debate about privacy. The opposition made a lot of noise about the need to ensure that tax file numbers would not interfere with individual privacy. It made a lot of noise about how it had demanded changes to the original proposal so that the privacy of the individual would be protected. Yet here is an opposition senator clearly quite prepared to disregard totally the issue of privacy, not only in relation to a taxpayer's tax commitment as decided by the tax office—which is disgraceful enough—but also in relation to the tax file number itself, which he revealed. Coming from an opposition that has expressed an extraordinary amount of concern about privacy, that was a disgraceful action indeed.

You are into Senator Baume for one reason, and that is that he has been on to the Prime Minister and his pigs for years and he has been absolutely under the Prime Minister's skin. That is the fact of it; that is the motive of it. It is just a piggery cover-up.

        It was such a transparent, lacklustre effort by the Treasurer that it barely calls for a response. What a humiliating performance we saw from the Treasurer. This is just a payback for the fact that Senator Baume has been asking a very simple question: how come a bloke who has been on an MP's salary since he was 26 has been able to accumulate assets more relevant to and more likely to be accumulated by the get-rich-quick merchants of the 1980s? Explain how the Prime Minister can have millions of dollars worth of property in Sydney when he has spent most of his time in politics on a backbencher's salary. That is Senator Baume's crime.

        </emphasis>
        in a moment to substantiate that point. Secondly, on its merits, I believe this motion is unworthy. Thirdly, the motives behind this motion are so transparent that I encourage the two Independent members to give it very careful consideration. To make a very strong point, I refer the member for North Sydney and the member for Wills to page 347 of

       A motion of censure of a private Member has been moved on only one occasion. The motion was agreed to. A motion has been agreed to censuring the Leader of the National Party, then in opposition, for conduct unworthy of a Member. On a further occasion a motion was put to the House condemning the Leader of the National Party for reflecting on the Speaker, but the motion was withdrawn, by leave, after the Leader had apologised for and withdrawn his remarks. On a number of occasions a motion of censure of the Leader of the Opposition, or an amendment expressing censure in the form of an alternative proposition, has been agreed to.

       These are considered to be bad precedents. Such resolutions, as distinct from a resolution of the House suspending or expelling a Member, are of no substantive effect and are only regarded as an expression of opinion by the House. A motion in the form of a censure of a Member, such as the Leader of the Opposition, not being a member of the Executive Government, is not consistent with the parliamentary convention that the purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a Minister's responsibility to the House. Furthermore, given the relative strength of the parties in the House, and the strength of party loyalties, in ordinary circumstances it could be expected that a motion or amendment expressing censure . . . would be agreed to, perhaps regardless of the circumstances or the merits . . .

       This whole process is to bring the executive to account. According to the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        House of Representatives Practice
       </emphasis>
       , this motion, if passed, would be bad precedent. There is only one precedent, and that is because the House in the past has not been prepared to use this process in the way proposed by the government. Regardless of the balance of the matter, I put it particularly to the Independent members that, whatever you think of the merits, a new process should not be hereby developed. The rules and conventions on this matter are absolutely clear.

        The only other precedent which is worth referring to is the one in respect of a senator being the subject of such a motion from the House. On a trip to Singapore, Senator Sim made some remarks which were apparently racist in their tone. On that occasion, the House repudiated the sentiments of what the senator had to say. That is the only precedent that might be relied upon for this motion. As I say, that should be differentiated on the basis that it related to the sentiments which might otherwise be attributed to his remarks. In respect of process, if this motion is passed, this would simply be an abuse of process—and that is very clear authority.

        The second matter goes to the merits of the issue. The motion, firstly, condemns Senator Baume. In fact, when the senators considered this matter with a more independent flavour to the debate, they changed that. They deplored his actions; that is true. But they referred to his negligence in tabling a document, whereas this motion refers to the condemnation of Senator Baume for his commission of an act. In fact, the Treasurer went further and said that it amounted to a criminal offence but for the parliamentary privilege. That is a gross exaggeration.

        Furthermore, the resolution of the Senate and the motion in this House call on Senator Baume to apologise for his behaviour. He admits that the TFN was revealed and he has apologised for it. The precedent in this House in such circumstances where such a motion is before the House and the member then proceeds to apologise is that the motion is withdrawn. On that basis the motion ought to be withdrawn. It is quite clear. His letter of apology has been tabled and on that basis, in respect of the restricted matter of the TFN, this motion ought to be withdrawn.

She did not just peremptorily review the document; she studied it. Then she, on behalf of the government as the duty minister, gave the consent—the leave—for the tabling of the document.

        —It says `our file number'. Thank you. So it did not say `tax file number'. But the minister looked at it in exactly the same way as Senator Baume did—he did not realise it was a tax file number any more than the minister did—and she then gave him consent. If Senator Baume has committed a heinous offence, quite frankly the motion ought to be amended and condemnation of Senator Crowley ought to be added into it. It is as clear as that.

        There is no doubt that Senator Baume made a mistake—and he has apologised for it—and that that number should not have been disclosed. But he did not at the time realise that it was a tax file number. As soon as he was aware of it, he took immediate steps, without any prompting, to ensure that that document did not go any further. It really is as simple as that. This was an unfortunate but inadvertent disclosure of a number. It was not obvious on the face of the document that it was a tax file number. It was tabled with the consent of the government. The senator has done a reasonable thing in terms of attempting to curtail or limit its distribution. He has apologised to Dr Macdonald for this issue of the tax file number, and that basically ought to be the end of it.

        The reason it is not the end of it is: firstly, you people want to abuse the processes of parliament; and, secondly, you are not prepared to accept that the proper place for this is the Senate where there has already been a resolution. Like the thugs you are, you are going to use your numbers down here to put through a motion which you could not get through in the Senate under independent and reasonable scrutiny. That is the fact of the matter. On that basis, this motion ought to be chucked out.

        —How embarrassed you must feel! The first 15 minutes of your contribution in this House you lectured us about propriety, about how we should uphold the standards of this place, and the second 15 minutes you were trying to defend what is the indefensible. You know in your heart that what Senator Baume did in the Senate last Thursday night was rotten, it was grubby, it was underhanded and, for all intents and purposes, it is probably criminal as well. The holding of a tax file number, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has pointed out, clearly, on our advice, breaches the tax laws. An investigation will be held into that and we will see where the senator stands. I want to say a few things about the tax file number, the integrity of it, and the part it plays in the tax system.

To divulge a tax file number, as the Treasurer has rightly pointed out, carries substantial penalties—a $10,000 fine and two years gaol. That is for the holding and disclosing of a tax file number.

        I have had experience with these things and I would like to relate that experience and the double standards held by the opposition when it comes to the disclosure of what it sees as privileged information. A number of years ago I sought some information from the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett. I was inadvertently given what were said to be doctor provider numbers. There was a big hullabaloo about that. When I sought information from Dr Blewett, I never sought those numbers—I never got them—and I never disclosed any information from those documents.

A subsequent investigation into that matter cleared everybody of any allegations.

        They were the standards set back then by the Leader of the Opposition. I want to look at the standards set since John Howard has become Leader of the Opposition. What we are looking at now is a totally different set of standards from that enunciated by the then Leader of the Opposition when he talked about my involvement with that information back in those days. Since Mr Howard has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have seen push polling in the Canberra by-election—one of the grubbiest, dirtiest election tactics you would ever see. Since he has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have had stolen documents being used by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in this House. Worse than that, confidential information was distributed to all of the media in Adelaide and to defence attorneys who were challenging the Commonwealth. Now, while he is the Leader of the Opposition, we have this trafficking in tax file numbers in the Senate—all for grubby political purposes.

We are interested in the whole ethos of the way in which this opposition is conducting itself. Those three instances that I outlined have all happened since John Howard became the Leader of the Opposition. At the next election, if John Howard is still the Leader of the Opposition, we will be in for the grubbiest, sleaziest election campaign in this country's history. You can see the way in which it is headed. Ever since he became Leader of the Opposition, we have had from the Liberal Party these underhand, dirty tricks all aimed at its opponents—but none of which, I venture to say, have been as sleazy as that which took place a week ago.

I really do not know. It is dishonest John, because he has said nothing to rebuke Senator Baume for what he did. Thank goodness there is a streak of decency and a bit of justice in the world, because I see in today's paper that Peter Macdonald has been re-elected to the seat of Manly.

With Senator Baume's having performed this act, having dropped this tax file number and all of the information, you would think they might feel a bit embarrassed. You might think that was a bit below the belt and that the best thing to do would be to shut up. Did they shut up? Not on your life. They were bragging about it on the flight from Sydney to Canberra.

        I turn to look at another matter. The fact is that while Mr Howard was Leader of the Opposition—and the Treasurer mentioned this—we had a serious debate in the parliament about privacy matters. No-one was more strident in standing up for the rights of privacy of Australians than the then Leader of the Opposition. We all remember the Australia card debate and the high ground taken by members of the opposition. The then Leader of the Opposition was poncing around the place championing individual rights, claiming that the card was going to be used by the government to control the lives of individuals and that it was a tool of Big Brother.

        When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he ran the taxation system of this country into the ground. He is still undermining the tax system but from a different direction. He is now condoning the release of tax file numbers in the Senate. You can say that with certainty, because he is not saying anything against the people who do it. This in his view might be smart politics. It sure beats generating policies. It is a lot easier to get up and assassinate someone's character rather than do the right thing and tell the people of Australia how you would run the country.

The funny thing, though, was that it was the same Mr Wright, the Labor Party fund-raiser—the one whose tax records show who the bagmen were for the Labor Party and who delivered from which companies—who got preferential treatment when, to put the facts down as they became apparent, the tax office put in a tax claim for this man's concern of $176,960.55 in unpaid PAYE.

        Then we come to the leaks themselves, and the most damning of them all relates to Mr Phillip Smiles who was the Deputy Treasurer of the New South Wales government. Amazingly there were details leaked about his affairs to the newspapers. There was no outrage about privacy; it was simply that the details were leaked about his personal tax affairs. There was no outrage at the time—except that it was, could we say, for grubby political purposes. There was the parliament on a knife edge. Had Mr Smiles been convicted of a criminal offence and forced out of the parliament at that time it would have meant there would have been a change of government; that there would have been a Labor government instead.

        So we had a report; we didn't read it; we had the details leaked; we had the prosecutions commenced and—guess what?—not under the Taxation Administration Act, oh no, but under the Crimes Act because only then could you have been certain of having the government change hands. So what did we see then? We had a prosecution; we had a barrage of publicity. Nobody said, `What about Mr Smiles's privacy?' Nobody was concerned about the fact that his privacy had been breached. We said that this was a matter of importance for the public record.

        How come we have one standard for Mr Smiles and another standard for Dr Macdonald? Let me remind honourable members that the amount of money involved in Mr Smiles's case was $11,000 or $12,000 and the amount of money in Dr Macdonald's case is $104,000. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will be interested in this because Dr Macdonald has a very important medical practice, yet in the year 1988 he said he had an income of only $7,000. You can blame your tax agent, you can blame your accountant, but he actually had to sign off his figures himself. If he actually believed he had a taxable income of $7,000, then he should have been on welfare. In fact, the tax office made him pay another $40,000.

        —So we go back to the question of double standards. We had a debate earlier this morning and, when ministers stood up to defend the government's position, what did they say? They said that we were having a debate not about the fact that it was hypocrisy and two standards but on moral integrity. Well, we are. The fact of the matter is that we see patently every day that there are two standards exercised in this chamber. There was a request for a serious matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) in this place. But, oh no. Were any of us surprised when we got the answer we got? Certainly not. We expected it, because that is the way business is conducted here—on double standards.

        I go back and point out that in several cases in the New South Wales parliament since the election in 1992 we saw again and again the question of taxation being relevant to the electorate of New South Wales. How come it was relevant when it was Terry Metherell or Phillip Smiles? Let me ask this: in the business of so-called grubby political capital or grubby political advantage, who was it that ran television advertisements, during the election we have just completed, featuring Mr Smiles as somebody who had been disgraced? Mr Smiles was in fact acquitted on the criminal charge, the charge that was meant to trigger an advantage to the Labor Party when it was first raised. Then he was hounded by the likes of your confreres until he had to leave the parliament. Let me ask you why, then, it is not reasonable for Dr Macdonald's tax matters to be on the public record, when it was for those of Mr Smiles and Dr Metherell? It is the same issue.

        I want to come to the question of the leaking of the so-called tax number. I want to read from the document that was duly tabled in the House. The letter is from dear old Mr Cortese, who is so good at giving letters of comfort to Labor Party people or their friends. At the top of the letter it does not say `tax file number' or `file number'; it says `our reference number'—`our' meaning the tax office. Pardon me, but I thought the importance of the tax file number was that it was allocated to us as individuals. I would expect such a letter to say `your tax file number', not `ours' meaning the tax office's number because that is not what it is. But that is what the letter says—`our number', meaning the tax office's number.

        Of course, we can go back a little further in the history of the tax office to something that occurred in 1992 when the tax office itself leaked documents about individual taxpayers—inadvertently, it said, because it pressed the wrong computer button. It sent details of individual taxpayers, including their tax file numbers, to the wrong people. What action was taken? Was anybody prosecuted in the Parramatta branch of the tax office? Oh no; certainly not. What happened? Well, we sent in a little team to do an investigation and we asked the Privacy Commissioner to have a look. Finally, what did we do? We wrote a little letter of apology to the people concerned. Here we go again—more double standards. We have got plenty of them, have we not? We have got Paul Keating who was not prosecuted for failure to put in his return but who got a letter of comfort, whereas 10,000 ordinary Australians got prosecuted.

Somehow, it was supposed to be unfair for the electorate to be aware that Dr Macdonald had underestimated his tax affairs for six years, involving $104,000, and that is supposed to be kept private because it is not relevant in his case. But it was supposed to be relevant in the case of Mr Smiles involving $11,000 to $12,000 which was also repaid—a matter where he had to be prosecuted under the Crimes Act.

So we have double standards, don't we?  We have double standards when there is an error and, dare I say, unacceptable conduct from people on that side of the House. The weight of numbers is used in order to avoid the consequences of that act. Last week we saw the electorate make a decision about what it thinks about Mr Keating and his cohorts. Last week we saw the most unmitigated swing, a huge swing, against the Prime Minister, who said, `It's everybody else's fault but mine.' We saw a swing of up to 20 per cent in a safe Labor seat.

        I come back to the motion that was moved this morning. It was debated ad nauseam in the Senate. The Senate rejected the proposition of the government, so here we are, having another go. The fact is that you have given the opportunity to have laid bare once again the duplicity of this government, the dishonesty of its leader—the leader who gets rich while the people get poorer, the man who does not put in his tax returns, the man from whom we see double standards at every turn. This put-up job, as was said by the Manager of Opposition Business, to try to get Senator Baume is nothing but an exercise in duplicity and hypocrisy, as we have become quite accustomed to seeing in this place, and ought to be rejected.

        What Baume did arose out of a long sequence of events beginning with Dr Macdonald's tax returns of a decade ago. A tax review was instituted as a result of an investigation into the tax accounting practices of a Manly accountant used by Macdonald and many other people in the Manly area.

        On becoming aware of the investigation Macdonald voluntarily resubmitted his returns through a new tax accountant and fully satisfied the Australian Taxation Office. The tax office required only interest repayments on additional tax to be paid but no penalties were involved and the tax department noted the full cooperation of Macdonald and his new accountant. I have here a copy of a letter from the deputy tax commissioner confirming that, which I am happy to table.

        That should have been the end of the matter but in late 1992 the tax office advised Dr Macdonald that former Premier Nick Greiner's office had Macdonald's tax details and his tax file number. Greiner's office had contacted the tax office claiming Macdonald's tax details had been sent there by mistake. Shortly after this, the self-styled head-kicker for the New South Wales Liberal Party, Michael Yabsley, sneered at Macdonald privately in the New South Wales parliament saying, `Why don't you pay your tax?'

        In December 1993 the then member for North Shore, Phillip Smiles, who was later convicted of tax offences, rang Macdonald to let him know that he also knew about Macdonald's tax affairs.

        Macdonald obtained documentation from the Australian Taxation Office clearly setting out the position, fully exonerating him, and sent copies to Greiner and New South Wales Premier Fahey, assuming he was dealing with honourable men. On 2 December 1994 Fahey telephoned Macdonald and indicated that he had examined the documents and quite properly agreed there was no basis for any allegations or question of wrongdoing. He undertook to advise the Liberal candidate and his advisers to that effect. Again that should have been the end of the matter.

It is to the eternal credit of Peter Macdonald and the electors of Manly that this sickening parade of infamy was rejected, but I am afraid that Dr Macdonald would be less than human if what has happened does not colour his relations to the detriment of the Liberal Party, given the likely state of the New South Wales parliament over the next four years.

The Liberal Party's actions in Manly have not only brought every member of this parliament into contempt but added to the public loss of trust in the institutions of the country. Do not make any mistake. The people of New South Wales did not put the Liberal government out because of their love for Labor or its policies.

Notwithstanding the fact that this man was able to declare an income that would have put him on social security, this wealthy general practitioner owns a $1 million-plus house in King Avenue, Fairlight, and four other properties in one of the most exclusive parts of Sydney.

This is one of the most serious actions to take, to condemn a member of parliament. It is even more serious when this chamber moves to condemn a member in another place. I understand that never before has such an extreme move been taken. Indeed, I had to go back to 23 March 1972 to find a similar motion. This indicates the gravity of what has occurred. Indeed, if this had happened anywhere outside of the parliament, Senator Baume's behaviour in publishing this material, in particular the tax file number, would have been criminally punishable. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

       This, colleagues, is the well documented Michael Baume style. In 1977, in the last hours of the campaign for the state seat of Wollondilly, Senator Baume launched a vicious attack under parliamentary privilege on the Labor candidate for the seat, Bill Knott. Bill had lost part of his foot in an accident at the steelworks at Port Kembla some years earlier, and Baume said publicly and under parliamentary privilege how disgusting that a man who was an invalid pensioner should stand for parliament. Bill Knott made the wonderful reply that it was only his foot that had been amputated, not his brain—like Baume's had been.

This person, who takes the high moral ground on every issue, is the same person who opened an electorate office in the Wollongong area claiming that the local members were not doing a good enough job in representing the area, and promoting himself as a locally based senator—not that anyone ever saw him.

        In case there is any doubt, Senator Baume knew precisely what he was doing and he did it for political advantage. His action was poll driven. It was driven by Liberal Party internal polling. Over lunch on Monday in this very parliament, Senator Baume boasted that, before his attack on Dr Macdonald, Dr Macdonald had a five per cent lead. That lead disappeared after the attack. It was a deliberate attack by the New South Wales Liberal Party using Buckets Baume to take the seat of Manly from the sitting Independent. This is the same Michael Baume who tried under parliamentary privilege to find muck in the investment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the piggery and who made outrageous comments about the Prime Minister's purchase of a house. He is the same Michael Baume who, as chairman of the opposition Waste Watch Committee, had a Commonwealth car wait for him for almost two hours while he was at a dental appointment. He is the same Michael Baume who was involved with a failed stockbroking firm, Patrick Partners—the firm that cost thousands of pensioners their life savings. That is the high moral standard of Senator Baume.

        —I rest my case. The point is that this is characteristic of the way the Labor Party behaves. Let us just have a look at what you yourselves have done in campaigns over the years. During the last federal election campaign in the electorate of Adelaide when Trish Worth had been preselected as the Liberal candidate in that marginal seat, you were dead worried about losing. Of course, there was all the bravado—`We won't lose; we won't lose'—but you were dead worried about losing, and for good reason: you lost.

        During that campaign the Labor Party got a state politician to stand up in the state parliament and make allegations that the honourable member for Adelaide was involved in some kind of financial kickback arrangement with a firm with which she worked at the time. It was totally unsubstantiated and totally untrue but, after all, with only a few weeks to go before the election you thought, `At least we can run a smear and hopefully some of the mud will stick'. The fact is that in Senator Baume's case what was said about Macdonald happened to be true. What was said about Trish Worth by the Labor Party was a bare-faced lie; it was totally untrue.

A Labor backbencher in the state parliament, one of those you only ever hear from when mud is thrown which is totally untrue and unsubstantiated against the Liberal Party—and the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) is a great one for arranging these sorts of things as I will explain in a moment—stood up and made claims about the financial arrangements of the Liberal candidate in order to elicit this headline: `Libs in new candidate bombshell'.

        —We have seen what the opposition calls a defence of the actions of Senator Baume. They are trying to put up a defence for a set of circumstances which should again be spoken of in this House. What are the circumstances? Senator Baume obtained, from sources unknown, a letter which was a private communication between the Australian Taxation Office and an Australian citizen. It should not matter that Dr Macdonald is, or was, a candidate for public office. The fact is that Dr Macdonald is an Australian citizen and communications between the Australian Taxation Office and an Australian citizen are private and confidential. Nevertheless, that is the document that Senator Baume had.

What they say, though, is that there was no mens rea—what was done was a totally innocent act. There is mens rea and it is demonstrable that what Senator Baume did is part of an overall tactic of the Liberal Party led by John Howard. It is part of an overall strategy to bring this parliament into disrepute by unfairly attacking Australian citizens, whether they be members of parliament or otherwise. That is demonstrable.

        There is a strong case that the Liberal Party has a tactic of going deep into the sewers of Australia and, indeed, it is going deeper and deeper into those sewers. To gain the evidence for this, look at a number of incidents that have occurred recently both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Look at the behaviour of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in this House when he used leaked material from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to attack former Senator Richardson on the so-called Operation Wallah. Despite the fact he could not prove his case, he nevertheless had no hesitation in standing up in this House and doing a bucket job.

Pre-February 1988, the then health minister—the former member for Bonython, Dr Blewett—in an effort to discredit doctors, gave to the then backbencher, the now Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), a series of documents which he proposed to use in his role as chairman of Labor's price watch committee. The now Assistant Treasurer was at that time running a campaign against doctors that was associated with this government's attempt to reduce the burgeoning cost of Medicare. As is always the case with such campaigns, the strategy was: attack the providers.

        There was a background to all of that. The two women being attacked were sisters. They were both government lawyers. One was the ex-wife of Brian Easton. At that time, the other was working for the Legal Aid Commission in Western Australia and had been appointed to represent the interests of women who had been defrauded by a woman called Robyn Greenberg, who conducted a form of building society called Western Women.

        These women had been defrauded. They had been recommended to go to Robyn Greenberg for financial advice. Many of them came with the pittance of their divorce settlement or maybe the inheritance from the death of a husband and were told by a government instrumentality called Women's Information Referral Exchange to go down to Robyn Greenberg because she was a female financial consultant—a woman who had been through two previous bankruptcies—and take her advice as to how to invest their money. They did seek her advice.

        She invested it for them and then stole the money. She is now in gaol for having stolen $3 million. These women were trying to recover from the government of the day, the then Labor government under Premier Carmen Lawrence, that money. They had a heap of evidence that they had been advised by a government agency to invest with Robyn Greenberg's Western Women. Just prior to this date, I think it was 22 November 1992 or thereabouts, and Helden raising these allegations of perjury against these women in the parliament, Margaret McAulay, one of those women, the lawyer representing the interests of these women, went to Premier Lawrence and told her that the case was insubstantial.

        The point I want to make is that, just days before these allegations were made, Margaret McAulay, the lawyer appointed by legal aid to represent the interests of these women—and I would have thought the member who just rose would have been rather interested in this—went to the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, to tell her that on her inquiries these women had an irrefutable case against the government, that they had been so advised and that the government should settle. Margaret McAulay told me she has never seen a person so angry as Premier Lawrence after receiving that advice. As history records, Premier Lawrence refused at any time to settle with those women. She was eventually out of office when the Court government took up the proper responsibilities of government and settled with them.

        So much for the government's adviser on women's affairs. To protect her own party and her own government from the accusations of making a very bad mistake, she was prepared to leave women in poverty. But, of course, Margaret McAulay had to be punished. But then another embarrassment arose for Premier Lawrence relating to some $5,000 of travel money she had been given two years before but had failed to repay.

The point I am making is that that embarrassment was on the cards. The government needed a smokescreen and it proposed some form of attack on the then Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court, because there was also an allegation floating around that one of these women had attended his office and requested certain information relating to her ex-husband. It was clear from police inquiries that Mr Court had never given anything and had referred that lady to the public record of things he had said in parliament.

        But the simple fact was that John Halden MLC brought down a petition which he knew to be false. Worse, he had actually been an adviser, counsellor or something in the Family Court and took to the parliament secret information from the Family Court. He could not make the claim he did not know the gun was loaded. He was an experienced person. He took information to the parliament which attacked a woman called Penny Easton, the ex-wife of Brian Easton.

Members of the New South Wales Liberal Party have introduced the politics of the big smear, from the garbage bins of the Lodge—and the garbage man himself is at the front table—to the Hindmarsh Island papers affair, to push polling in Canberra. Some of the push pollers are in the gallery and the beneficiary of push polling, shamefully, is about to be sworn in to this parliament.

        This is the same Michael Baume who came to this parliament in 1975 after a seedy and undistinguished career with the infamous Patrick Partners. As we all know, under the present laws of the Australian Securities Commission, if any stockbroking firm now carried out what Patrick Partners did then, it would be charged. This was the shoddy practice of producing TV programs to induce people to buy shares with the offer of a bonus payment. He has not changed one little bit. Had the airing of Peter Macdonald's tax file details occurred outside the parliament, Senator Baume would have been charged and criminally punished for his act. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number.

        —With your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker, on behalf of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party and on behalf of the federal coalition, I would like to extend an extremely warm welcome to the newly sworn member for Canberra, Brendan Smyth. Our new colleague enjoyed the largest swing in modern political history in Australia. A swing which approximates to 17 per cent on a two-party preferred basis is bigger by three or four per cent than the swing in the Tasmanian seat of Bass in 1975 that heralded the end of the Whitlam government.

        All I can say is that this is not so much a victory for the Liberal Party or a victory for Brendan Smyth; it is overwhelmingly a victory for mainstream Australia, which is demanding of its government a recognition of the difficulties under which mainstream Australia has been labouring now for a very long time. I know those opposite find this uncomfortable, but they are going to find the next eight or nine months even more uncomfortable.

        In case they see the New South Wales result as some of kind of fleeting hour of triumph, let me remind them that, even in New South Wales, there are some very interesting statistics. At the last federal election, in New South Wales the coalition enjoyed 45.6 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Last Saturday we got 51.8 per cent of the two-party preferred vote which, if you extrapolate that consistently, would give us 10 seats in New South Wales.

How seedy, how hypocritical, how rotten of the member for Warringah to come into this House holding up Michael Baume as his role model, holding up the Leader of the Opposition as his role model—with the smut and smear campaign tracking itself all over the parliament right to the Leader of the Opposition's door—when, in his own arrangements, he is the beneficiary of not one but two tax minimisation devices: the Abbott family trust and the Tony Abbott family trust.

        —The point is that I was being accused of trading in smut. The understanding of `smut' is, although I do not have a dictionary with me, at best an inaccurate interpretation of facts. I am simply putting on the record that what I said was never an inaccurate interpretation of anything, but simply an indication of the realities of the Prime Minister's lifestyle and his cost to the Australian people.

        —In rising to defend Senator Baume today, I might say that it amazes me that more people in this place have not read the following books:
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Bold Riders
        </emphasis>
        by Trevor Sykes, John Pilger's book
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Secret Country
        </emphasis>
        , and two other books, about what happened in this country during the 1980s. Trevor Sykes, a very reputable person in every way—I do not think anyone in this House would deny that—said in his book that $16,000 million was lost to some degree to the benefit of about 20 people whom he names in the book. During that period the banks lost $28,000 million. To give you an indication of where that money went and how this money was allowed to go to these areas, I will refer to a
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Time
        </emphasis>
        magazine article on corruption—not in Australia but in another country.

        Let me hark back for one moment to the fact that the result of $28,000 million being lost by the banks during the 1980s by being loaned out to various people and the money then vanishing was that one in four farmers has gone broke and been forced off his land since 1986. Over 800,000 small business families in this country have been broken over the last eight years. In my electorate there were two suicides last year. One was a person being hounded by a bank; he had to shoot his cattle because of the drought and he then turned the gun on himself. The other was a young man, the son of a prominent grazier family in the area. Like every other family, they were finding it very tough. Only last week we had the deplorable case mentioned in the House by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) where a young man who was about to be foreclosed on by the banks locked himself in his homestead. The reason that this is happening in Australia is that $16,000 million was creamed off by 20 men. If you go through the list of 20, you will see that about half of them were prominent beneficiaries of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, they served on committees to raise funds for the ALP; and I can name them in this House.

        magazine article. It was an article about the corruption that exists in Indonesia. The Australian press is wonderful at casting aspersions on countries like Indonesia. This article says that it is possible that this person could have blown away as much as $200 million of public funds on a project. He had friends, maybe even in the ministry, who facilitated money from government instrumentalities to go into a petrochemical plant project. This was horrific. It demonstrated how endemic—and it was the worst case yet—corruption is in the Indonesian government. He may have got away with $200 million. It was alleged in the article that this was simply a device dreamed up to take money out of the public purse and put it into private pockets, and some of that money went back to government officials.

        I refer to the petrochemical plant project, because that is what we are talking about today. We are talking about corruption, and those people who have the courage, aggressiveness, energy and surveillance to be able to stop corruption from occurring in this country, and Senator Baume is one of those people. I refer to the petrochemical plant project which is before the courts in Australia. It is not speculation; it is reality. Effectively, it involves two men: Laurie Connell, who was the head of fundraising for the ALP in Western Australia; and Dallas Dempster, another prominent bankroller of the ALP in Western Australia. To say that he bankrolled the ALP in Western Australia but not federally is to insult the intelligence of every person in this House.

        Anyway, they had this great scheme for a petrochemical plant project. I am sure that they were definite about building it. They sold this project to the Western Australian government for $392 million. The liquidator moved in later on, as it did in just about everything in Western Australia, and liquidated the assets of the petrochemical plant project. The liquidated assets of the petrochemical plant project totalled $11 million. These two men had effectively pocketed $381 million. Indonesia is terribly corrupt, but in Australia, of course, we have a very clean government. We do not have that sort of thing happening in Australia. If that is endemic, and that is the worst example yet of corruption in Indonesia, all I can say is that it must be a very honest government compared with the government of this country.

        I will move on and talk about Bell Corporation. The beneficiary of Bell Corporation now sits on the Reserve Bank of Australia where, undoubtedly, she was put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have it on very good authority that he used to stay with them when he was visiting Western Australia when Robert Holmes a Court was alive. Bell Corporation was sold to instrumentalities of the Western Australian Labor government for—depending upon which article you want to choose—$360 million, $465 million or $260 million.

        Those are just two examples. I could sit here for the next half-hour and quote examples from these truly magnificent books which disclose what happened in Australia during the 1980s. I ask myself—and historians in future years will also ask themselves—why nobody in this place had the courage to stand up and say, `This has got to stop.' These were government instrumentalities, government banks. It was the job of the Reserve Bank of Australia to stop this from happening. That is why the Reserve Bank exists—to act as a watchdog in overseeing all of the banks in Australia.

        Again and again in those books you will see reference to the fact that the Reserve Bank failed to take any action whatsoever. That was particularly glaringly obvious in the case of the savings bank of South Australia, as it was in all of these other cases. One must ask why the Reserve Bank did not act. Why did the people who were paid a king's ransom to oversee and stop this from happening allow $28,000 million of people's hard-earned savings to go up in smoke in deals of this nature?

        Senator Baume has had the courage to speak out. He faces a very serious defamation action. Unfortunately, in Australia the defamation laws are different from those in any other country. We do not have a freedom of speech principle in our laws in Australia. I strongly commend the High Court action. Maybe one good outcome of the terrible events of the 1980s is the fact that the High Court has now moved in the Theophanous case to virtually abolish defamation action where matters of public interest are involved. So we are moving into the same situation as applies in the United States.

        I rather enjoyed some of the comments that have been made. Ray Martin interviewed me and said, `How would you like these things to be said about you?' He referred to some of the things I had said about some other people, and I burst out laughing. That was not the sort of reaction he expected from me. I said, `That is extremely mild compared with the things that I have been called and the concerted attacks made upon me, my family, my character and my honesty over the last 20 years in the state house. And you must be the only journalist in Australia that is not aware of some of those attacks because they made the national dailies on a number of occasions.' As a minister and a member of the Queensland parliament I went through six separate investigations. No politician anywhere in the world has been more investigated than the National Party of Australia members of the state house in Queensland.

        That was defined, Mr Acting Chairman. The leading case was the case of the Queen v. Brian Austin. Brian Austin went to gaol because he had used his government car for private purposes. He had used his government car to visit his kids at school on the weekend and on a number of other occasions. He had used his plastic fantastic to take people out to dinner. That was why Brian Austin, a human being, was put in a steel cage for two years of his life—he was sentenced to four years and he served two years of that sentence.

         The 1994-95 budget provided for the maintenance dredging of Kedron Brook floodway, at an estimated cost of $9.1 million. The Commonwealth owned Kedron Brook consists of an 8.5-kilometre long deep-water channel, passing through approximately 500 hectares of flood plain, linking the Kedron Brook with Moreton Bay. It was constructed in 1980, by the Commonwealth, as part of the Brisbane airport development, to replace the existing flood plain drainage system, which was filled during airport works.

          The Kedron Brook floodway has not undergone any maintenance dredging since it was constructed. The dredging now proposed will remove silt deposits which have accrued over the last 15 years, and will restore the channel to its original design performance capacity.

          That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of Scarborough House and construction of Commonwealth offices, Phillip, ACT.

         Scarborough House has not undergone any major refurbishment since it was constructed in 1970. The building's internal fabric is now at the end of its life, and its services are generally below currently required standards. The proposal is for the total refurbishment of the building and the upgrading of base building services, to a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards.

          The proposed new building will provide approximately 10,400 square metres net lettable area of office space and approximately 600 square metres net lettable area for storage. The estimated outturn cost for both the Scarborough House refurbishment and the new building's construction, including AIPO's fit-out cost, is $50.38 million. The project will be undertaken in two stages, with the construction of the new building scheduled to commence in July 1995 and to be concluded with the refurbishment of Scarborough House, which is to be completed by February 1998.

Report 326 was the result of the first major public examination of the administration of taxation laws in Australia since the enactment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In its report the committee sought to introduce balance to a system which it saw as having grown to ignore the people it serves.

The improvement project has already produced impressive results with its simplified rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax law. Just yesterday the committee was briefed by officials from the improvement project on their proposed framework for the new income tax assessment law. The framework, which will be released for public discussion in late April, promises to be a major step forward in the process of producing clearer and simplified tax law.

        The National Health Amendment Bill 1995 amends the National Health Act 1953 to continue the benefits achieved in the last four years of the agreement with community pharmacy. The bill reflects the fact that both community pharmacy and the government recognise the importance of the current agreement in being able to make fundamental changes to community pharmacy, and the need to continue those changes. The current agreement has provided the incentives and the stability to allow these necessary changes to occur in an environment of cooperation and planning.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This agreement has provided assistance to over 600 pharmacists to voluntarily accept payment to hand back their approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In general, these pharmacies have been the smaller, less viable pharmacies which adversely impacted on the cost of supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The agreement has encouraged pharmaceutical services to be established and maintained in isolated areas. Over 400 pharmacies in isolated areas now receive extra remuneration to assist in meeting their higher costs.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The agreement has produced a period of stability during which government and pharmacy have not been locked in conflict over remuneration issues, a situation that has unfortunately dogged past relationships. This has given both pharmacy and government the opportunity to explore the beneficial role of pharmacy in health care for the community at a time when community health care is changing rapidly. Noticeable now is the recognition by the pharmacy organisations of the need to monitor the performance of community pharmacy and to measure the outcomes of their activities in health care. In other words, pharmacy is moving from a reactive to a pro-active service to the community.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill will allow these changes to continue while building on the experiences gained from the current agreement. Both the government and pharmacy agree that the number of approved pharmacies is now at about the correct level and that the closure and amalgamation payments should cease. The ratio of pharmacies per 1,000 population is now within the range of international figures, unlike the higher levels previously experienced. It is now a matter of continuing to encourage a good distribution of pharmacies rather than the clumping that has occurred in the past and that still exists in some areas of our capital cities.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To achieve this distribution, the current controls relating to the relocation of pharmacies are to be relaxed so that developing areas around the capital cities and other growth areas can be provided with appropriate pharmaceutical services. It is expected that these relocated pharmacies will come from the presently overserviced areas. To encourage the provision of pharmaceutical services in rural and remote regions, the incentives for pharmacies to operate in isolated areas will be continued under the legislation. The bill will permit simpler procedures for approved pharmacists wishing to sell a business or change the ownership.

         In other cases, the valuable work and successes of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be maintained. The authority will be reduced in membership and its name will be changed to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. It will continue to use the experience of hands-on pharmacists to advise the secretary on applications for new approvals and on relocations of approvals. The criteria for these considerations will, as is the case under the present agreement, be set out in a determination made under section 99L of the National Health Act 1953.

         It is necessary to be confident that pharmacists who supply pharmaceutical benefits maintain adequate standards of practice. The bill will permit the secretary to apply conditions for holding an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits, primarily applying standards of practice developed by pharmacy itself. The bill also introduced the ability of the minister to agree to professional allowances for specific professional pharmacy activities outside the pharmaceutical benefits supply functions. One such area is medication review of residents in nursing homes, a very important area.

         —I will not take up too much of the time of the House to discuss the National Health Amendment Bill, which the coalition does not oppose. The National Health Amendment Bill 1995—and I must say that I have noticed the name change—is the enabling legislation for the new pharmacy agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, as the professional association of retail pharmacists. It replaces the agreement which has operated since 1991 under which the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority has presided over a major shake-out in the retail pharmacy industry.

         The bill replaces the authority with a new Australian Community Pharmacy Authority which will make recommendations to the government on applications to supply pharmaceutical benefit items, the payment of allowances in isolated and rural areas and the payment of allowances for specific professional services. The bill will also end the financial assistance program which has operated under the present agreement to facilitate the restructuring process. I am advised that that process has seen the number of active pharmacists in Australia decline by about 10 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The coalition notes that this agreement will introduce two new allowances to replace the essential pharmacy allowance. These new allowances are the isolated pharmacy allowance and the remote pharmacy allowance. We see the importance of ensuring pharmacies continue to operate in areas which may not be as financially attractive as other locations. Therefore, we support these allowances.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill also introduces a professional allowance which will give some recognition of the professional activities of pharmacists outside the supply of drugs, such as participating in drug evaluation trials and the simple giving of professional advice over the counter. We welcome this wider conception of the role of pharmacists in our community—a role I wholeheartedly support and endorse. I should add that we also have no objection to the government's amendment extending the life of the new agreement by one year. This is welcomed by the industry, as the longer period will create greater commercial certainties for retail pharmacies.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In summary, we do not oppose the bill, because it is sound and, more importantly, it has been negotiated with the Pharmacy Guild over a period of time and is quite acceptable to the players involved. In this regard, the government is to be congratulated and I commend this consultative approach to the portfolio minister in respect of other areas of health that we will be debating in this House later today.

         With this bill, however, the government has certainly fallen short of best practice in some respects. We are going to the wire with this piece of legislation as the new pharmacy agreement is still unsigned—I understand that this will happen later today—and the agreement itself comes into force on 1 April 1995. That is this Saturday. As a result, my office has received many queries from colleagues and from pharmacists themselves, particularly those who would be seriously affected by the sudden delay of the remote and isolated pharmacy allowance.

         It is not good enough for the government to be bringing this legislation through the House 36 hours before the deadline. We are also aware that negotiations between the government and the Pharmacy Guild have been protracted, having opened as long ago as November 1993. Indeed, cabinet only approved the agreement last week. Meanwhile, thousands of pharmacists have been hanging on anxiously as the bureaucratic wheels ground on.

         Finally, I am concerned at the way that this reflects on the government's treatment of this parliament. We are here now rubber-stamping an act of executive government, which still requires a major agreement to be signed. While I appreciate the cooperation that I have received from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to this bill, the government cannot walk away from the fact that it is operating, in the passage of this bill, on the assumption that the parliament will simply be a rubber stamp for the executive.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It reminds me of our debate last year on what is now the Employment Services Act 1994. In that instance, you may recall that the government passed enabling legislation to establish the Employment Services Regulatory Authority to oversee its job compact. Yet, on the weekend before the bill was debated, there was an advertisement in the national media seeking a chair for the authority—a position eventually given to one Joan Kirner. That advertisement appeared before the parliament had passed the legislation.

         Also, the explanatory memorandum to this bill is simply unprofessional. A prose rendering of each provision of this bill, a mere jargonistic paraphrase, gives little understanding of the operation of these provisions. The general outline is little more than a very vague narrative. This is something which has been raised in this place before, by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I want to raise it specifically in relation to the explanatory memorandum provided by the Department of Human Services and Health which has been circulated in this place in the life of this parliament.

It may be a small thing, but it reflects the dim view that the executive arm of government has about the members of this place. I, and my coalition colleagues, simply say to the government that, whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may think, Australia is a parliamentary democracy and we in this place are the people's representatives. By showing disdain for the representatives in this place, the government shows disdain for the Australian people. It shows that disdain at its own peril, as shown by the swearing in of the new member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) today.

         —This has been a very short debate on the National Health Amendment Bill, but I note that the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has felt so strongly as to move a second reading amendment. I am rather surprised at that. He puts forward an interesting case. He says that he agrees with every feature of the bill, in particular with such very important matters as the question of pharmacies in isolated places, the special allowance and the professional allowances for pharmacists. I am also very enthusiastic about this new development. I have met with the Pharmacy Guild and with other pharmacists' representatives and they are all very happy with that.

         It seems as though, on the basis of the second reading amendment, there is some misunderstanding on the part of the member for Chisholm about the procedure here. We had to have the framework in which to progress the negotiations. That framework is the bill. We have not assumed that everything is going to be concluded entirely in the context of the bill. All we have said is, assuming that to be the case in the general structure—we have not concluded the negotiations; we are going to conclude the negotiations after the bill is passed—that the passing of the bill will give us the opportunity. So I am not sure why he says that we have pre-empted the parliament and that the parliament is a rubber stamp. It is not a rubber stamp in these matters. As the honourable member well knows, this parliament is not a rubber stamp like some parliaments in the Westminster system, because we do have the other place, and at the other place the government does not have a majority.

        This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, referred to in schedule 1 of that act, may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act.

         The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the land rights act that area of land which is the subject of the Hodgson Downs land claim. The Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council and claimants in the land claim have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the land rights act to grant the claim area, excluding the Hodgson River road and the Miniyeri community access road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the land rights act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple.

I just wish to add to what he has said, that it is under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 that the most gains have been made by Aboriginal people. This has certainly been the landmark legislation in the area of Aboriginal affairs and certainly land rights.

         It was legislation enacted by the Fraser government in 1976 and since that time, as the minister has noted, there have been a number of parcels of land that have come under the act. The amount of land that has now passed to Aboriginal ownership under this act and separate from other acts is 536,000 square kilometres, altogether 40 per cent of the Northern Territory land mass. Certainly the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have gained momentously from this act of the Fraser government which followed the Woodward report.

         —The bill we are discussing this afternoon is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose of this bill is to add one parcel of land to those granted to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. The land is situated in the Mataranka region, south of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The land, with an area of some 3,232 square kilometres, is of cultural significance and contains a number of sacred sites. Known as Hodgson Downs, the area is under pastoral lease from the Northern Territory government and is used as a cattle station. It has a population of 240 Aboriginal people, and was purchased by ATSIC in 1991.

         Because all interests in the property are held by or on behalf of Aboriginal people, a land claim over the station was able to be lodged under the provisions of the original act. In effect, this bill seeks to convert the title from the Northern Territory leasehold to Commonwealth freehold. Despite its opposition in principle to the lodging of land claims over Aboriginal owned cattle stations, the Northern Territory government in August last year agreed to a settlement of this land claim without the need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.

         This is a positive development for a number of reasons. Not only did the Northern Territory government do something which for once showed a bit of thought in dealings with Aboriginal issues; it also saved a considerable amount of time and money. Most importantly, however, it will enable the handover of title to take place while the elderly traditional Aboriginal owners are still alive, something upon which they place enormous importance.

         As already noted, because all parties agreed to the station being granted to an Aboriginal land trust under the act, there was no need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. Therefore, the only way for the station to be granted a trust was by means of an amendment to schedule 1 of the act. Therefore, this is a very clear and well thought out process and a very positive development, and this government is pleased to bring this bill before the House to achieve this purpose. In enacting this bill, the government sees the practical and positive manifestation of our policy towards indigenous Australians and the broader goals of our social justice policy.

         One might use the term radical for some of the suggestions in here which will provoke discussion and debate, which was the very purpose for putting them in the document. As a parliament and as a House we need to have our preconceived ideas challenged from time to time. We need to do a little bit of lateral thinking. I do not think enough lateral thinking occurs in politics in this country. This document sets forward some very important and valuable suggestions. It does not say, `Thou shalt do this. Thou must do that.' It is not a letter of demand or an ambit claim by Aboriginal people. It is meant to be a means of promoting and stimulating discussion and consideration of very important issues, and I think people need to understand it in that context and not just summarily reject out of hand certain suggestions that are made in the book, without really thinking about what they are trying to achieve.

         In this parliament and in the greater public domain there has been a lot of debate and discussion about constitutional reform and the Prime Minister is on the public record stating the agenda that he believes should be achieved in constitutional reform. One of the important things that is set out in this booklet is the plea by indigenous people in this country, saying, `If you are going to consider constitutional reform, you need to also consider indigenous Australians.' If you read the constitution of Australia, it ignores the very existence of an indigenous people. In 1991 the High Court of Australia pulled us up and told us that the myths that we had based our constitution on had to be torn up; that we had to face the reality that when European people first settled in this country there was prior occupation and ownership of this country.

         The High Court forced us to do that because this parliament failed in that respect. Now we are saying that, if we are going to give some real meaning to that High Court decision, we need to look again at the constitution. We need to write within the constitution a recognition of the importance in the current structures of government of the prior occupation of this continent. I as a member of this parliament respect and strongly support those structures, but they are built on ignoring the fact that there was a prior civilisation occupying this continent which had a very strong culture and a very strong identity, and it has rights. Our constitution needs to recognise the existence of these people and that they were the owners of this continent. These people need to have their rights respected and recognised in the constitution. That is a very important issue that I think we in this parliament need to take up.

         The document also raises a few other issues which I am sure some people are going to be a bit hesitant or nervous about. It talks about the lack of any parliamentary representation for indigenous people. Only one indigenous person has been elected to the federal parliament of Australia, and that was a senator from Queensland who represented the Liberal Party, Senator Neville Bonner. In 94 years of national parliament, with 1,000 or more politicians elected to either the Senate or the House of Representatives, it is a disgrace that there has been only one indigenous person in parliament. It is a disgrace that all political parties—my own included—need to think about.

         We need to accept the challenge this document has set us. We need to accept that our political structures and the way in which our political parties operate are very exclusive. They exclude a lot of groups. In the way they operate, in the way they select members and in the way they select representatives for political office, most mainstream political parties in this country exclude indigenous people. We need to address that. This document says that we need to work around the great undemocratic injustice that exists.

Indigenous people with qualities, merit and ability should be elected. But our processes at the moment operate to make sure Aboriginal people do not feel comfortable about our political parties. They do not join the parties, they do not work within the parties and they certainly do not stand for political office.

         This document has suggested that, to correct that anomaly, that undemocratic symbol, we may need to consider reserving seats in the parliament for indigenous people. It is not saying, `You shall do it.' It is not saying, `We demand this right.' It is saying, `This is something you need to consider.' It is floating the idea and saying, `We want you to seriously consider it.' That there are no indigenous people in this parliament is a very clear symbol of the lack of fairness, equity and social justice in this country. We have 223 parliamentary representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Not one of them is an indigenous Australian. Indigenous people make up some 1.65 per cent of the population of Australia and a representative proportion of them in the parliament would be at least three people, probably four.

         This booklet is saying that indigenous Australians are entitled to have three or four members of the parliament. It is saying that if mainstream political parties are not prepared to look at themselves and do something about this situation, perhaps three or four seats should be reserved in the federal parliament for indigenous Australians. That is not a unique concept. New Zealand has tried it and, while there have been some problems—I am not sure whether it is the way to go—I would not reject the suggestion out of hand. There are certainly things about the present situation that we need to seriously consider because it highlights one of many anomalies that exist in our society.

         The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a very simple bill. For those in the gallery, it is two paragraphs and, although I have not counted them, there are probably a couple of hundred words. It is a very straightforward bill, at least superficially. It says that under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 a particular portion of land, by agreement between the Northern Territory government, certain Aboriginal people and the federal government, will be transferred to Aboriginal ownership.

But it is important to look at some of the underlying features that are relevant to this piece of legislation and like legislation in action. The legislation was passed by the Liberal government in 1976 when the then minister was Ian Viner, who, to the government's credit, was recently appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which council produced the report

         When we talk about passing land to Aboriginal people, it is more than just handing over a deed or a bit of paper and sitting back and forgetting all about it. There are some fundamental issues here. All members of this House, without exception, and increasingly the general public, will understand that the indigenous people in this country—a small percentage of the population—are, by any yardstick, significantly disadvantaged compared with the rest of the population.

         The average male life expectancy is 18 years less than the broader community—for women it is 15 years less—and there is overcrowding in houses. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting across the chamber, and I have been to communities where we have seen 20 or 30 people living in quite small three-bedroom houses with limited sanitation and so on. There is an almost permanent unemployment rate in Aboriginal communities of 70, 80 and sometimes 90 per cent. You do not need a recession to make it bad in Aboriginal communities; it is a fact of life throughout life. Aboriginal women have diabetes at a rate eight times that of the general population. In many Aboriginal schools 50 per cent of the children will have middle ear infections. So they have a health problem and an education problem, because if you cannot hear you certainly cannot learn. One can go on with the statistics.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will recall that only recently we had tabled in this place a comprehensive report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which documented in really quite appalling and frighteningly awful detail the disadvantages of indigenous people in this country.

         One of the sad things that I have learnt in the five years I have been in this chamber—a number of measures have been put in place over the years to try to address some of these problems—is that, as I go around, I do not see any real evidence that the situation is improving significantly at all. Certainly, the statistics do not suggest the situation is improving at all.

         I am concerned that the government, which I have acknowledged previously in this place has good intentions to try to resolve the problems, in the last 12 years it has been here has not been successful in the various things it has done to improve the lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have had a number of initiatives. Money has been spent, organisations like ATSIC have been set up and health, education and language strategies have been put in place, but the reality is that those things have not worked very effectively at all. Therefore, we need to look at some new ways of dealing with that situation.

         In my view, and most Aboriginal leaders whom I talk to have a very strong feeling about this, we have to break the welfare mentality—the fact that we just hand out money and people take it, and often it is regarded as sit-down money, but they still have nothing to do with their lives; that they are still living in appalling conditions; that they do not have the infrastructure or the sanitation; that the local council does not empty their dustbins; that the attendance rates at school are appalling; and that there is alcohol and substance abuse. For example, in the Pitjantjatjara lands I saw four-year-old kids sniffing petrol. It is quite appalling.

         Those sorts of things are going on all the time. We have to try to break this whole cycle of poverty and disadvantage, and we will not improve the situation while we take what I believe is a paternalistic view and just hand out money and think that that will fix it. We have to look at some underlying changes to our philosophy. For example, in the whole criminal justice system, a 15- to 19-year-old Aboriginal youth is far more likely to be in gaol or in custody in some shape or form than a non-Aboriginal of the same age. It has
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        nothing to do with the colour of the skin. In a country where there is disadvantage in terms of employment, health, education and all those things, Aboriginals are going to get into trouble with the law anyway. But in Western Australia an Aboriginal of that age is 50 times more likely to be in custody than a non-Aboriginal of that age.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We have had inquiry after inquiry. We had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, with 339 recommendations. The government has allocated millions of dollars to implement those recommendations. The government, the opposition and the state governments have accepted almost all those recommendations, and we have had voluminous reports tabled in this parliament every year saying how much effort has gone into implementing those reports. But the reality is that the bureaucracy has gone mad but we are not seeing much change on the ground.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Therefore, it is important that we start to look afresh. It seems to me that we have to get installed—or reinstalled—into the Aboriginal psyche in some shape or form some self-esteem, some pride and some determination to try to help themselves. That is not to put them down. But we cannot just say to them, `Here is some money. Get on your way.' We need to have a number of initiatives in place that will involve the Aboriginal people in decision making and in decisions of how money is spent. They also need to be given help from the ground upwards. We need to put in place a number of preventative measures rather than trying to fix problems after they have occurred.

         For example, in the health area, yes, we need health centres, treatment, doctors and all those sorts of things. But, rather than having national health strategies that come from the federal government and go via the state governments—with regional bodies and ATSIC involved in the act and political stoushes as to whether the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), or ATSIC via the minister, have control—we ought to be looking more at the simple things that will fit in with Aboriginal culture, and we should put some responsibility in the communities so that people's time is occupied and they will start to take an interest in their welfare. For example, perhaps far more money should be put into community nursing so that the nurse goes along to the house and makes sure that little Johnny is eating properly, that the hygiene standards are in place and that he has his jabs when the doctor tells him to, and so on.

         A fundamental change of attitude is needed. We need to get back to some more simple, straightforward, basic approach to dealing with some of these matters, and we have to get the Aboriginal community itself committed to doing some of those things instead of always sending in outsiders. Obviously outsiders will be needed for training, but we need to get the bureaucracy out of the way and some practical action in place on the ground.

         It is important to Aboriginal people, if we are going to get them to take a larger degree of responsibility at the ground level for a number of these matters, that we give them self-respect and pride, that we get them off alcohol, and that we give them things to do in terms of work. It is important, therefore, that we acknowledge some of the symbolic things that will restore that pride and self-esteem. The grant of land is one way, and that is what this bill is all about.

         . One of the things mentioned in there is that there should be a recognition, in the preamble to the constitution, of indigenous prior occupation and ownership of this country before European settlement took place. It is an historical fact. It seems to me that, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was set up, just such a preamble was included in the legislation. I have not noticed the heavens fall in since that legislation was passed, and I very much doubt if the heavens would fall in if it was in the constitution preamble. But it would be an important symbol for indigenous people to have that sort of recognition. It seems to me that, unless you undertake a few important symbolic things as well as some of the practical things, then you are never going to get on top of the problems and issues that I have been talking about.

         The previous speaker also referred to representation in parliament. The council did not recommend that there be separate indigenous seats in the parliament. It said very specifically that it was an issue that was raised by many indigenous people during the consultation process. It is an issue that, in consultation with the wider community, a number of people raised as well, and it is therefore something that needs to be looked at and understood, and perhaps debated. If there is general community and bipartisan support, then you would perhaps go to a referendum to give effect to that. But, if there is no general community support, the council says you would not proceed because it would be divisive—and that does not do anybody any good, particularly the indigenous people in this country.

We all have normal expectations that our dustbins will be emptied, water supplied, our roads made up, sewerage facilities supplied—all those things—and, as citizens, Aboriginal people should also have those things. The report also talks about Aboriginal people having rights to acknowledgment as well. I do not think any of us, if we are treated as second-class citizens, would have the self-esteem to be able to get ourselves out of some of the practical problems that would then beset us, and Aboriginal people are no different.

         When we pass a fairly straightforward, simple piece of legislation such as this, it is important to remember the underlying issues that are behind it. It is not just a question of saying, `Here is a bit of dirt that we are going to give to Aboriginal people.' That is important. They may live on it, they may work it, they may or may not make profits out of it, but it is part of an overall package of activity. It is an amendment to a piece of legislation of which the Liberal Party has always been proud—and justifiably so—and it is part of an ongoing battle to try to make sure that we do treat our indigenous people better. I certainly commend the bill to the House.

         —I am also pleased to participate in the debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2). As the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) said, this bill, which we are in the process of considering at present, is probably one of the briefest pieces of legislation to become before the parliament. That of course belies the importance of it. It is extremely important.

         The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon), who represents the Northern Territory—the area about which this piece of legislation is concerned—and the constituents that occupy that area, is at the table. The fact that he is in the federal parliament representing the Northern Territory with the overwhelming support which he has been able to gain and maintain indicates the way in which he and his colleague Senator Bob Collins are respected by the constituents which they represent so effectively in the Northern Territory.

         As has been indicated, this legislation refers to the Hodgson Downs property in the Northern Territory. The purpose of this legislation is to transfer it to the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners of that land, and the people who occupy that land. I acknowledge that the reason this legislative approach is being used on this occasion is that it was possible to get agreement between the Northern Territory government, the Aboriginal claimants and the Northern Territory Land Council in order to undertake this process of having that land transferred to them.

         The member for Aston is one of the better informed members of the opposition in relation to Aboriginal people in Australia. He is one of those relatively few members of the opposition who have some sympathy for Aboriginal people, some understanding of their background and the circumstances which they face as a minority people who originally owned and occupied the whole of the Australian land mass 200 years ago. Some say the Europeans invaded; others say they settled. I do not think the question is so important. Certainly, the opportunity occurred 200 years ago for white Europeans to take from the Aboriginal people in Australia, sometimes under horrendous circumstances, land which those people had previously occupied and owned. I think it is to the credit of those three organisations that that agreement was reached.

         It is not always the case that agreements between responsible people and responsible organisations in Australia are able to be achieved in order to achieve, in turn, a proper outcome for those people most affected by it. It is interesting that we are amending the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was introduced initially in 1975 by the Whitlam government. That legislation followed the findings of a royal commission which was appointed by the Whitlam government in 1973. The royal commission was chaired by Justice A.E. Woodward and became known as the Woodward royal commission.

        In the field of Aboriginal affairs, this is undoubtedly the most important legislation ever to be introduced into the Australian Parliament. While several States have moved towards the recognition of Aboriginal land rights, this legislation goes much further than has previously been contemplated in Australia. This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission—the Woodward report—and grant land rights to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. It will provide for freehold title over all reserves and certain other lands to be vested in Aboriginal ownership and give Aboriginals control over what happens on their land, including control over mining developments.

        Major political changes took place after that, with the sacking of the Whitlam government at the end of 1975, and that particular legislation lapsed. Fortunately, it was reintroduced under the Fraser government by the then Minister Viner. The interesting thing is that, while the opposition continues to claim credit for many of these initiatives, an examination showed that it so frequently sought to thwart, frustrate and obfuscate—to place obstacles generally in the way of—significant initiatives being taken.

         That October 1975 Labor land rights bill followed 15 months of investigation by Justice Woodward. It followed a further 18 months of consultation with Aboriginal groups. In the process of Labor dealing with that legislation, the coalition opposition, the conservative opposition, sought to refer the bill to a standing committee for a further report. That is typical: delays compounding delays. That has always been the tactic.

         In June 1976 Mr Ian Viner introduced the Aboriginal land rights bill which followed on, as I say, from that Labor legislation which was initiated during the period of the Whitlam government. In November 1976 debate was resumed by a conservative coalition government and that government itself was responsible for introducing 42 amendments. A conservative coalition government introduced 42 amendments in 1976 after it became responsible for that legislation. We do not need much more evidence than that to prove the claim I make that, to a very large extent, the conservative coalition's position in relation to many of these issues concerning Aboriginals and Aboriginal interests would appear to be less than genuine.

         It is interesting that there appears to be an impression that, right from the start of British and European colonialism—when they invaded, occupied and expropriated the land of native people, wherever that happened to be—there was a failure to recognise those interests. That is not so. Initially, to a very large extent, the rights of indigenous people, wherever they happened to live, were respected and were expected to be respected by those people who acted on behalf of the Crown. Let me give some examples. George III—who was the King of England towards the end of the 18th century, at the time that Australia was first `discovered' by Cook—in 1763 said:

I remind the House that the report noted an unemployment rate of 38 per cent overall with a rate of 50 per cent for those Aborigines aged between 15 and 19 years. Of the 40,200 unemployed persons, 77 per cent had been unemployed for three months or longer, and over 50 per cent had been unemployed for 12 months or longer. Examining health related issues, the survey found that 17 per cent of rural Aboriginal households did not have doctors available at all, or that they were available less than once per month, while 54 per cent did not have access to dentists and 74 per cent did not have mental health services available.

         It is a truism that there is no simple panacea to improve this utterly unacceptable situation. Aboriginal communities are diverse with very different needs and circumstances.

         In those communities there are widely differing government jurisdictions and employment opportunities and many other historical, cultural and social factors contributing to their present situation. Such complexity defies simple analysis, yet it is my belief that the issues are becoming clearer, particularly as they relate to economic advancement for Aborigines. For instance, there is a clear perception among the community and decision makers that economic advancement provides a significant platform of opportunity to benefit Aborigines. The entitlement to the safety net of welfare assistance is a right that no needy Australian should be denied, yet beyond the safety net economic independence is the cornerstone of self-determination for any community.

         The granting of land rights through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was a significant step towards economic advancement for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, particularly through mining ventures. This act established mechanisms for negotiating the exploration and mining of minerals on Aboriginal lands and the use of the resultant royalties for Aboriginal advancement. The act created Aboriginal land trusts to receive grants of inalienable freehold title to Aboriginal land, with property rights to minerals retained by the Crown. Land councils were also created to act as agents for the traditional owners on land matters and to negotiate terms and conditions for exploration and mining with an independent arbitrator if an agreement could not be reached. Equivalent amounts to the mining royalties returned to the Commonwealth or Northern Territory governments were to be paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account.

         Forty per cent of the funds obtained were to be divided between the land councils as general funds, with 30 per cent to be paid to the land council in whose district the mine was located, and intended for the affected Aboriginal community. The balance of 30 per cent was to be distributed between Northern Territory Aborigines as a whole, as payments to cover administration of the trust account and as further payments to the land councils if they could not cover their expenses from other payments. Anyone wishing to explore for minerals or acquire a mining interest over land granted to Aboriginal owners had to negotiate through the relevant land council. The act provided that the consent of the relevant land council and the Commonwealth minister was required before either exploration or mining was allowed on Aboriginal land.

         Since its proclamation on Australia Day 1977, the act has been subject to considerable amendment. In 1987, in response to claims that the legislation was unworkable and was inhibiting resource development in the Northern Territory, the act was amended to remove the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they had previously agreed to exploration. Amendments at the same time required traditional owners to decide on new mining proposals within 12 months, with the possibility of extension. If an exploration proposal was rejected, then no further applications could be made for five years.

         In 1991, the Industry Commission, in its report on mining and minerals processing in Australia, examined the operation of this legislation as it applied to mining investment. In addressing the effectiveness of the legislation, the Industry Commission said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The holding of land rights by Aborigines may lead to smaller levels of mining . . . activity in the Territory relative to those which would have occurred. However, provided Aboriginal landowners face appropriate incentives, it would be wrong to conclude from this that land and sub-surface resources were not being devoted to their socially optimal use. In this sense, the . . . real test of the workability of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 is not necessarily the amount of land under exploration, or the number of mines on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, but rather the extent to which Aboriginal landowners are able to freely exercise their ability to withhold or grant consent for exploration and mining.
       </para>
       <para>
        The key point that I wish to draw out of this conclusion by the Industry Commission is that, for natural justice to prevail, the traditional landowners must be able to make a completely informed decision on an exploration or mining proposal. Thus they must be able to assess the incentives offered by the developer, negotiate on these incentives and then decide whether the benefits outweigh the possible disadvantages.

        Viewed in these terms, a good budget could be seen as easing the pressure for possible further monetary policy tightening. That is true.

         Why is he saying that? One of the reasons he is saying that is that he was Secretary to the Department of the Treasury in the 1980s. As the government kept reducing those big budget surpluses and cutting government spending, as that contracted from activity on the public sector side of the economy, it added to private sector activity because there was far more confidence about the economic settings. That is the point he was making there. It is a sophisticated point. That is why it got past you.

        I agree with him on that. The record has shown that this government has introduced a contestable economy in this country by removing tariff barriers and by introducing enterprise bargaining. We are getting natural growth in productivity and that is holding down wage costs. As well as that, we are seeing a general understanding by the work force about wages growth.

Merchandise exports increased by four per cent but merchandise imports increased by only one per cent. Clearly, the movements in that area are in the right direction for us.

         In relation to exports, I make a couple of points. Firstly, the impact of the drought is showing through, particularly in regard to cereal exports which, in the last three months, are 43 per cent down on what they were in the same three months of the previous year. We are seeing drought having quite an impact in some areas of rural exports, particularly in relation to cereals.

         Despite that, total exports for February were at their highest level ever. There are some encouraging signs in regard to non-rural exports. The figure for non-rural exports was the highest ever. For non-rural commodity exports, which have been trending down for the year to September of last year, we are seeing increasing signs that that is being reversed. We are seeing a pick-up in both volumes and prices.

         The rise in imports of one per cent was entirely due to imports of capital goods, which went up by 13 per cent. That, of course, reflects the fact that investment is growing strongly. With a 24 per cent increase in investment now forecast—a figure that the opposition said was impossible to believe; it said that 14 per cent was impossible—we expect to see strong capital imports. That is what we have here. That is a good thing, because it means we have a greater capacity to sustain economic growth and employment in the future. It also means that we avoid high capacity utilisation ratios. If you have very high ratios, it means that there is a situation in which inflation can easily take off. Imports in areas such as consumption goods are down six per cent and imports of intermediate goods are down one per cent. So, on the import side, the general picture shows some degree of encouragement.

         We want to have sustainable growth for the future. It means lesser growth than the five per cent to six per cent growth that we are currently experiencing—a point that Mr Fraser made in his speech. I can say in that respect—and since this is the last sitting day before the budget—that the budget will be designed to achieve a more sustainable rate of economic growth. It will be designed to achieve a better balance of demand and growth so that we do not have demand spilling over into imports. It will also be designed to achieve a structural improvement in savings in this country so that we can continue to experience substantial growth without a balance of payments constraint.

         I make one other point. I notice the Greens have been saying that they will not cooperate with the budget, in the sense that they do not think we need to have a reduction in the deficit. They do not believe in the twin deficit theory. We are not pushing twin deficit theory here. We are not saying that it automatically follows that if you reduce the budget deficit you reduce the current account deficit, but we do say it goes in the right direction.

         The key issue here is the savings investment balance. If you have strong investment, you need to have stronger savings. If you do not do that, you will certainly have a large current account outcome. In the circumstances we face with strong investment, it is crucially important that we improve our savings performance. That is what the budget will, in part, be designed to achieve.

But since then Australia has been whacked with a further $130,000 million worth of current account deficits and our foreign debt has doubled to $162,000 million. In 1990 you deliberately engineered the worst recession since the Great Depression to solve the problem. With Australia now in the middle of yet another current account crisis, how will you try to solve it this time? Given that a long recession and a short recovery did not fix the problem, is it not a fact that a lasting solution to the problem is completely beyond your capacity to deliver?

If you doubt that, just go to the Statistician and have a look at the loss of product during the last recession and the loss of product during yours. If you doubt it, it is simply a matter of record.

         That is an enormous structural sea change for Australia. It occurred by a shift in manufacturing production, manufacturing exports and exports generally which has improved our capacity in relation to the current account. The terms of trade have been running against Australia for a long time. That is, in the early postwar years the things that Australia traditionally exported commanded very high prices and the things it imported commanded low prices. Therefore, our standard of living rose. In the 40 years since the war, we have had a complete reversal of that: the things that command the high prices are the products with intellectual innovation in them and the things that command the low prices are the bulk traded commodities—agriculture and minerals—and this has seen our terms of trade fall dramatically.

         It was the constant fall in those terms of trade that the Liberal Party, when in office, never picked up on. The Liberal Party made no change to our manufacturing structure to make the adjustment for when it happened. The salvation coming from higher exports and from the shift in the composition to manufacturing and services was delivered by this government. It was delivered by this government because, had we relied on the same composition of exports as John Howard was prepared to rely on from 1977 to 1983, Australia would be absolutely dead in the water. We would have a recession prone and massively interest rate ridden economy of the variety we have seen in other parts of the world.

That is why for the first time ever we now find ourselves no longer in the position where we are a majority rural and resources exporter. As a consequence, exports—

The members of the opposition could never have done it, and they showed in office that they were incapable of doing it. That is where the fundamentals have changed. Another fundamental that is worth noting is that wage inflation is now under control. Last quarter's data show an overall annual increase of 4.1 per cent.

         I just say about the current level of the current account that the unsynchronised nature of the world recovery has meant that Australian demand for imports has picked up ahead of world demand for Australian exports. When that world economy gets into better synchronisation, we will have a better outcome. So let the Leader of the Opposition not dupe himself, even if he is prepared to dupe his party or the public, into believing that he ever had any solutions for dealing with the current account at source—a fundamental change in manufacturing services. Let him very clearly understand that the climatic change in inflation, wages growth, competitiveness, product innovation, education, manufactured exports and services is the only salvation for a country that let itself be lured into the dangerous position of relying exclusively on agriculture and mining, to our long-term detriment.

          —Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. Let me take up your invitation. Under standing order 145 the question from the member for Banks related entirely to the deferment of COAG. The Prime Minister stated the reason for the deferment of COAG. He is now totally irrelevant to that particular question. I invite you to rule so and in the ruling accept the fact that Labor would lose 11 federal seats in New South Wales on Saturday's vote.

The other question is whether, in terms of activity in the economy, the early, but I believe timely, increases in interest rates by the government to slow the recovery and make it sustainable have not in the long run been entirely in the best interests of the economy and the community at large. As a consequence of the things the Treasurer eloquently said earlier, the government will, between now and the next sitting of the House, bring in a budget. Both he and I have said that the import of that budget will be, we believe, to make further interest rate increases less likely.

         There is only one way to low interest rates in this country; that is, through low inflation and a proper balance between the demand and supply sides of the economy. I cannot tell the honourable member—because he was not around at that time, obviously—this was never so under his party in office. The Leader of the Opposition, when Treasurer, had wages growth of 16 per cent, and he did not know what to do about it. When the last big wage round came through, Malcolm Fraser caught a plane to England to see the royal wedding; do you remember that? When wages blew out—they were right on the table—instead of staying and fixing it and dealing with it or doing his best, Malcolm Fraser jumped on the plane and went to the royal wedding. The wedding present we got was the 16 per cent wages growth which followed.

         That is why interest rates peaked under the now Leader of the Opposition at 22 per cent. It is no mystery where the 22 per cent came from; it was the high inflation from the 16 per cent wages growth plus the real interest rate. When you compare that to 10 per cent or nine per cent interest rates today, or 8 3/4  per cent for bills, it is a far cry from anything the federal Liberal Party was able to deliver. I hope for your sake that your party can understand what the influences on inflation are and understand that no mayhem wages system will deliver wage restraint and at the same time, in the doing of that, produce high productivity which reduces wages costs and holds inflation down.

         Let me give you this little bit of commentary on history: in the last year that the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he was the most worried person in the world. After we became the government he was the happiest, because all of a sudden the burden had shifted to some crowd who could actually do something about it. He works on the basis that if you stay here long enough the cycle will repeat itself. That is the one part of the lesson you should not take any notice of.

         The significant indicator is that, since 1983, the probability of a student completing year 12 and going on to university has doubled. It has gone up from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. It has gone up because of our policies. Our policies have been committed to massively expanding the higher education sector; policies that we will persist with and that we have developed without having to resort to up-front fees for undergraduate students.

         Last election, the Liberals went to the campaign on a policy of fees and vouchers for funding universities. Their justification then was: `If we allow overseas students to pay for places, why don't we let our own students pay for places?' Where is the equity in the argument which says that our own people have to pay up-front to get into universities? Where is the equity in that?

         This week we have seen a surprising about-face by the opposition in this direction because the shadow spokesman on higher education, Senator Hill, does not believe in fees any more. In a radio interview on 28 March, in justification of this position, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Now that the situation has changed somewhat in that there has been a stabilisation of the number of students, there is not the demand now.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a simple point of contrast between that statement, which was made on 28 March, and what the Leader of the Opposition had to say just four days before. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the big problems with tertiary education in Australia is that every year there are thousands of young Australians who are shut out of tertiary education and there aren't enough places.
       </para>
       <para>
        His shadow spokesman said that we do not need to raise fees because there are sufficient places; yet he said four days before that there are not enough places. The message out of that is twofold. The first is that they will say anything to suit the occasion and the second is that, if demand for places does go up, the Liberal Party will resort to fees to fund them, because the only basis upon which it has ruled them out now is that the demand does not justify it.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The students also have another concern—that universities, through their commercial arms, are seeking by the backdoor to charge up-front fees. In the House yesterday I indicated quite clearly what our position was on that, but the shadow spokesman for the opposition, in relation to the backdoor approach, said that he has some sympathy for that position. Not only would the opposition bring back fees if demand rose, but it would allow far greater flexibility to the universities to charge for postgraduate fees.

         —I thank the honourable member for Bonython for his question. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that all young Australians receive an education which is both full and relevant. We have already achieved Labor's goal of encouraging more young people to stay at school to finish year 12. One out of three students used to complete year 12; now three out of four do so. These young people are now demanding, quite justifiably, further skills. With around one-third of them going on to university, the Commonwealth has been determined to make additional places available for vocational education.

         In 1995 the Commonwealth is contributing $695 million in basic funding for TAFE through ANTA. We also contribute growth funding. This year we are making $310 million available, which brings to $820 million the Commonwealth's contribution to meet growth in the TAFE system since the agreement was signed. However, this growth funding is dependent on the states and territories maintaining their effort. We do not ask them to increase it; simply to maintain it.

         —It has always been a conundrum for those people who want to see the best of our native forests preserved and those who want to see a viable forest products industry to be able to see themselves sitting beside one another in harmony. There will never be, in this policy, in this whole area, the capacity to serve everybody's aspirations completely. But this government seeks to try to serve them well. The government has considered, over a substantial period of time, all the issues involved in representative reserve systems and how we might keep a decent representation of species amongst particular stands of trees. At around half past four this afternoon I will be saying something public about it. The cabinet considered it at length again today.

         Part of the difficulty always in forest management in these terms is that the environmental imperative has been operated through the residual powers of the Commonwealth under the export powers. The Commonwealth is not a manager of state forests. It is because of this need to refer to state management systems and state managers of forests that there could never be within the Commonwealth a management system that would adequately serve the full expression of those powers. That is what this discussion has been about. With a lot of goodwill between ministers, departments and the states, we are seeking to come to the right conclusion about it.

         This is in marked contrast to the coalition. When Mr McLachlan, as the former shadow minister for the environment, said recently that he was adopting a policy for the coalition against clear-felling of trees for land clearance, the Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said he would not have a bar of the policy. He overturned it completely.

         I also observe that the opposition spokesperson for the environment recently appointed by the Leader of the Opposition believes that the Commonwealth's external affairs power—its treaty power—should not be used in any way for environmental protection. That is, things like the Gordon below Franklin and the world heritage listings would not be there were we to see this person's view that the external affairs power should not be used.

         So if the Commonwealth were not to use the external affairs power or its external powers in respect to exports, or export licences for woodchips, then its influence on forest policy would be very greatly diminished, and that side of the argument which seeks to have a representative reserve system in our forests and the preservation of native stands of trees could not be served. That is the key point.

         It has only been this side of the House which has taken the view that there has to be a balance between this—that we do want to see that but at the same time get to the position where we can have reasonable forest agreements where there are, on a scientific basis, the preservation of large, adequate reserve systems for trees. As a consequence of that, it would mean that we would not in the future be going through a coupe by coupe analysis of export approvals.

         But with the states tardy in coming into RFAs, regional forest agreements, there has been no recourse but for the Commonwealth to try to judge from this distance, as the non-operator of forests, which of these particular coupes can be made available for woodchips.

         So let us not have anybody from the National Party, of all people, asking us about forest management.

         The decisions made and announced this week represented a very substantial step taken by the government towards achieving the target set for us—a target that will result in a reduction of 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. As with other environmental issues, of course, that represents a balance between the interests of industry and what can be achieved at the environmental level. The package that the minister announced yesterday, I think, makes that balance in a way that has industry contributing very substantially through voluntary agreements.

         It also has a substantial commitment of people working through rural based programs, particularly around Landcare and REEP, where something like $250 million will go into employing something of the order of 25,000 people in making their contribution through their programs to the reduction of greenhouse.

         So the solution to the greenhouse issue lies in energy efficiency in terms of industry and it lies in the billion dollar tree planting program across Australia.

         Secondly, transport systems are important. It is important to see where improvements in urban public transport can contribute, just as the efficiency—or lack of efficiency—in housing can play a very important role and the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, can demonstrate effective ways forward. Finally, what greenhouse is about is achieving outcomes over specific periods. We need to see how we can achieve that by working with the states in Commonwealth-state programs where Commonwealth funding is involved. Part of yesterday's announcement was to look at ways to legislate to ensure that, where we make contributions to major state programs, we look to the outcomes environmentally in terms of reducing omissions.

         In its statement, the government indicated that it can achieve a great deal through the measures announced. But, in the longer term, we need to think more about what we can achieve through the urban environment. I think many people in the community will take very seriously the agenda in yesterday's statement. I encourage them to look at that part of Greenhouse 21C. It will be very important to environmentalists who operate with, are thinking about and are concerned with the brown agenda as well as the green agenda the Prime Minister referred to in terms of forests.

         We are debating matters without substance rather than the substantial matter of the Leader of the Opposition trying to introduce the immorality of the American political system into Australia, bringing with it his endorsement of the sort of tactics which I think most Australians regard as un-Australian and, need I say, unparliamentary. If the House of Representatives seeks to be able to transmit information and have a real discussion, this sort of noise and interjection, in which those opposite now specialise, and the disruption which is their principal tactic, will never become the stock-in-trade of a parliament that enjoys widespread support and respect.

         , cartoonist Moir very appropriately lampooned the slowness of the traditional manual counting method of votes in New South Wales elections. It is extraordinarily slow. We saw a similar performance in the ACT elections and also in the last Senate election. I am happy to announce that, in this day of the information superhighway, the AEC will soon be ready to implement a computerised scrutiny package which will greatly speed up the counting of votes in the Senate elections.

         In essence, the new system is called `Easy count' and it will dramatically slash the time taken to complete the Senate count in each state. New South Wales, Mr Acting Speaker, as you well know, is the slowest state to count manually because of the number and size of the ballot papers. It now takes weeks of counting to produce a final result. The reason the Senate takes so much longer than the House of Representatives is the below-the-line ballot papers. There are some 180,000 in New South Wales that need to be laboriously checked. Some ballot papers take 15 minutes each to be checked. That is why the Senate count goes on and on for weeks after the expiration of the statutory 13 days that we have to wait for postal votes. But hopefully no more.

         Under `Easy count' the AEC advises me that it will take the computer just two hours to do all those weeks of counting. The new system can be used in all states for the Senate. Party scrutineers will be reassured to hear that under `Easy count' a detailed audit trail of the entire counting process will make their jobs much easier. The keying in process for each ballot paper will be by two independent operators with the computer cross-checking any variation in their entry on the ballot paper. I think the House will be pleased to hear that the proposed change will not cost anything for the taxpayers. In fact, there will be a saving of $375,000.

We have been looking at a situation of improving real wages and improving real household disposable incomes. In the last couple of years we have seen very strongly rising real household disposable incomes in which wage earners have been participants. We are not talking about a situation in which people are suffering declining real incomes and declining living standards. The substance of the member's question gets to issues which are probably more properly addressed when I next confront the House on budget day.

       Shamefully, opposition backbenchers went to the all-time low of trying to raise the Prime Minister's children as a political issue. The chief goon on the opposition side, its expert on the whoopee cushion and imitation spider, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), was right into it, raising the Prime Minister's children and his wife as a political question.

What the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has said in words of one syllable is that, having made a personal explanation to put the record straight, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in this place has called him a liar. The member for Cowan has stood up and denied that again, having gone through all the measures that he could. Under those circumstances, I think it is incumbent on you to at least check the facts. The statement was made in here that the member for Cowan made a statement of untruth to this House in his previous personal explanation. I do not really think that is something that can just be allowed to slide away. I think the member for Werriwa has to be asked to withdraw and apologise.

        I was well aware of the substance of the question asked by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). By no stretch of the imagination was there ever any intention to refer to the Prime Minister's children. All of us on this side of the House would regard that as utterly unacceptable. He clearly referred to the Prime Minister's pigs. There was no reference to children. I think it is outrageous that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has deliberately again misrepresented the position to the member for Cowan, and if he had any sense of decorum and responsibility he would come into the parliament and apologise.

         —Mr Acting Speaker, I draw your attention to precedent and an issue in which you were involved several years ago. I remind you that one day the then member for Capricornia stood in this place and said words which were highly offensive to me. I rose at the time, objected to the words and demanded a withdrawal. He refused to withdraw, and you later negotiated with him and convinced him to come back to this place, apologise and withdraw. I suggest that you might follow that precedence in this case.

Whilst I was not involved in the counsel received by the honourable member who made the statement, I believe the counselling went on through the whip's office at that stage. The honourable member for Capricornia came back into the House at a later stage and made the withdrawal that was required.

He said that the Prime Minister had well and truly lost the plot and that he was no longer listening to the concerns of mainstream Australia.

         The ultimate demonstration of the accuracy of that statement was revealed today in the supreme self-delusion of the Prime Minister which lies at the heart of Australia's chronic inability to cure its current account deficit problem. For most of question time the Prime Minister invited the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people to believe that, when it came to parliamentary noise and the cut and thrust of parliament, he was an innocent abroad who was the victim of the rowdy tactics of the opposition and the incompetence of those in the chair. It is very instructive that at no stage did the Prime Minister deny reports of what he said at the caucus meeting about the incompetence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. All he sought to do was to claim that it was all our fault.

This week, which is only to Thursday, these are the people he has blamed for his problems: the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives; Graham Richardson; Bob Carr; John Della Bosca; Barry Jones; Ros Kelly; the voters of Canberra, that is 99,000 people; university students; the ACT Labor Party and the Legislative Assembly; the

The trouble is that he is doing 90 per cent of the work. The last time I remember another Prime Minister of Australia blaming his ministers for his problems, he lost the election eight weeks later. I think it is a very bad habit that the Prime Minister has fallen into.

         The serious part of it—the real rub—is that, while the Prime Minister deludes, Australia burns. That is the rub. For 12 years we have put up with this hubris. We have put up with this man who is drunk with his own hubris and arrogance. We have put up with him day after day, month after month, year after year offering one more excuse and asking for just one more opportunity.

         We all remember when he went on the John Laws program nine years ago and declared that, if Australia did not tackle the current account deficit problem, it would become a banana republic. That was a call to economic arms; that was how the Prime Minister later rationalised it. I do not think that was his original intention. He is very good at the ex post facto rationalisation—like suggesting that, when our vote goes up in New South Wales by six per cent, which extrapolated would give us a gain of 11 seats, it is a disaster. That is one of the most monumentally deluded rationalisations that I have heard from the Prime Minister. But he has done the same with the economy. Back in 1986 he said that, unless we cured the current account deficit problem, Australia would become a banana republic. Nine years later, three elections later, 25 broken promises later, the Prime Minister is still saying that our major problem is the current account deficit.

         I ask you, Prime Minister: how long must the Australian people wait until you finally deliver on the promises you have made about curing the fundamental problems of the Australian economy? That is the simple question. The Prime Minister tried again during question time to run this fictitious line that, in some way, the current account deficit problem during the time that I was Treasurer was worse than it is now.

         I happen to have been given a set of the statistics. It shows that, in the seven years the Fraser government was in office, the current account deficit at its highest point, which was in the second last year of that term of government, was 5.6 per cent of GDP. During every other year it was below four per cent of GDP. Let me tell you what has happened since Mr Keating has been either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister of Australia. In 1985-86 the current account deficit was six per cent, 6.1 per cent, 6.1 and 6.1; in the pre-recession period it was 6.1, 6.4, 6.4 and 6.4. On most occasions, it has been way in excess of what it was on any earlier occasion.

         Today's current account deficit figure for February is $2.2 billion. For the first time in history, Australia has recorded four consecutive monthly current account deficits of over $2 billion. The current account deficit over the year to February is 50 per cent higher than it was for the corresponding period last year. This is the problem that nine years ago the Prime Minister said he was going to fix.

         The reason why we have high interest rates in Australia is not only the size of the budget deficit but also that overseas lenders are charging a risk premium to lend to borrowers in a country whose current account deficit is the second worst in the OECD. Foreign investors regard Australia, when it comes to its current account deficit, as a bad risk.

That was a time of great political accounting, because what the people of Canberra said more than anything else was: `Prime Minister, we no longer believe you. We no longer trust you. We no longer have any faith that you can deliver solutions to Australia's problems. We want to send you a resounding message in no uncertain terms.' That is why they sent Brendan Smyth here with the biggest swing in modern political history in Australia.

It is something the Prime Minister is interested in.

         When the Australian people come to make their judgments about the relative performance of the Labor government versus its predecessor, they will do well to look at the record of the previous government. I am not going to spend much time on it today, but since it has been made an issue by the Leader of the Opposition let us just recall the fact that, when he was in office as Treasurer for five years, there was growth of employment of 52,000 a year and that under this government it has been 154,000 a year—100,000 jobs more a year.

Whilst he was producing one-third of the rate of employment growth, he was doing it with an inflation rate of 9.7 per cent per annum compared with the average rate over our 12 years of 5.4 per cent.

We have been addressing that problem we inherited from the previous government of a structure which simply was not taking the Australian people anywhere.

         We were overwhelmingly Third World in our pattern of exports, and that meant that we were facing a long-term decline in our terms of trade. We had to grow and dig up more and faster just to stay in the one place. As the end of the Fraser government period shows, as I already demonstrated, there was an inability at that time to stop a considerable increase in foreign debt. The terms of trade were adverse and we were facing a situation where Australia was going down the gurgler because we had a structure which simply was not suited to maintaining living standards—certainly in a relative way and maybe not even absolutely in the longer term.

         As well as producing those major changes on employment, inflation, industrial disputation and productivity improvement, this government has been about making a major structural change to the economy, which particularly shows up in the export field. We said we had to get away from the high protection policies which had been pursued in the past, bring protection down and make our manufacturing and service industries much more competitive so that they can compete and are not so reliant on commodities which are subject to supply and demand on world markets. Although they will always be important to us because we have that enormous comparative advantage in those areas, we simply can no longer rely on them.

         We had to structurally adjust the Australian economy in a major way to make our manufactured exports and service industries internationally competitive.

That is of tremendous benefit to the Australian nation, because the price of manufactured goods on world markets is much better, when taking into account the long-term trends, than the price of commodities without much value added.

         The accusation of the Leader of the Opposition that the government was sitting there and unable and not willing to address the current account problem is massively untrue. No government in the history of this country has addressed that issue more than this government has. Certainly we do have a high current account now—at least that part of his speech is right—in comparison with most other developed Western countries. We are also growing faster than most of those countries. We are doing it at a time of drought. That drought is knocking some $2 billion off our exports. We are growing at a time when the rest of the world has not been growing rapidly. The prices for and volumes of our non-rural commodities have not been good. They are starting to pick up now, as the rest of the world lifts its game. Obviously that is a good portent for next year.

We can look forward to an improvement in exports of non-rural commodities, and rural commodities for that matter, as, hopefully, the drought does completely break and the rest of the world has higher activity, and prices for commodities continue to increase. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects a nine per cent increase in commodity exports next year, or about $5 billion.

         At the moment we have a combination of high growth and very high investment, which is capital intensive and which puts pressure on the current account. Temporarily we have this high figure. As the Prime Minister said in his speech last night, these long-term trends are encouraging for the future. The efforts which we have made to bring about the structural adjustment and develop manufactured exports in a big way are exceedingly important to the future of this country.

         Very sadly, we have reached a stage in this country at which the recovery is very fragile indeed. The drought is worsening. On the matter of the national debt referred to by the Treasurer: at no stage when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country was the national debt anywhere near $25 billion. It was a great deal lower. In terms of ratios, it was in a better shape. To quote from the official documentation of the government, today that national debt is $162 billion—a sixfold increase in net debt terms or in quantum terms.

         Whichever way you look at the economic performance of this government—to take up the Treasurer's challenge—there is one other thing which the official ABS statistics show. It is a very sad statistic. The gap between rich and poor over the 12 years of federal Labor government in Australia has got greater. They are not my figures; they are the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is at arms-length from the government and even at two arms-lengths from the opposition. Those figures show that the gap between rich and poor is the true legacy of Labor. How left wing members can dare show their faces in this House and support this government in these circumstances, when they face the social inequities arising from the outcome of the Prime Minister's policies as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, is shameful. It is an awful legacy; it is one which you will pay the price for. You did pay the price for it in the Canberra by-election last Saturday.

         The Treasurer also referred to structural adjustment. It must be some little time since he sat down with the shippers of this nation because, whilst with the introduction of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority there was initially a degree of improvement, the truth is that that has dropped off in the last 12 months. Shipper after shipper, freight forwarder after freight forwarder, will tell you that the ports of Australia in terms of efficiency are lagging behind best international practice by a country mile. We are lagging further and further behind, for example, one of our competitors in many commodities—New Zealand. The taxpayers had to pay millions of dollars as part of an equation to bring about waterfront reform, buy-out, termination packages and the like, only to find that the situation today is worse, not better. Waterfront reform improvement existed for about five minutes. Now the sky is starting to fall in.

         We all know that the current account deficit problem was the reason given by the government for the last recession. Remember that one? The greatest since the Depression. We now have a current account problem again. So what do we have to look forward to? Another recession caused by higher interest rates—is that what this government has in store for us again? I hope not. The fact is that yesterday the Prime Minister said that eventually the current account deficit would decrease. How is it going to decrease? What policy prescriptions does this government have? What levers will it use to bring down the current account deficit? Again, the government is reaching, as it did three times late last year, for higher interest rates. That seems to be about the only lever it knows. That is why it got savaged properly in Woden Valley and elsewhere last Saturday. By the way, the truth about the New South Wales election results is that 11 federal seats held by Labor would fall to the coalition if Saturday's New South Wales voting was repeated at the federal level—and I think it will be.

         What broke my heart, and the hearts of farmers and small business operators, was hearing the Prime Minister say last night that there was going to be a bounce back from the drought, as if it were already over. In the Sir John Monash Memorial Lecture last night, with regard to the current account deficit, he said, in an insensitive way, `You'll have to put up with what I've got to say. This is what I'm going to say: there's going to be a bounce back in exports as part of drought recovery.' It was only after we prodded him today, on the floor of this House, that he eventually acknowledged that for so many the drought is not over and that for so many the drought is getting worse.

Not one Victorian farmer has eligibility for exceptional circumstances provisions; many in New South Wales do not and some in Queensland do not.

         —Australia does have a serious current account deficit problem but it is important that we do look at the issue in some detail rather than just the rhetoric that we get from the other side. The figures that were released today did contain some encouraging signs. We still do have a serious problem but they did contain encouraging signs. For example, there is a substantial increase in the percentage of merchandise exports. Today, Toyota Australia announced a $400 million per year contract to supply left-hand drive Camrys to six countries in the Middle East: the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. This will be 16,000 units in 1996, increasing in the following year to 20,000 units. That will allow that new plant to operate at full capacity. So there are good signs in the export area.

         It is also worth taking into account that there are a number of factors which are, in effect, inflating the current account deficit at the moment, the drought being the most obvious one. Other factors are: lower commodity prices, following on the recession internationally, which are starting to rise in many cases and will continue to rise; the fact that we had a bit of an expenditure burst in the latter part of last year which flowed into imports, which I would see as a flow-on from the recession; and, finally, the burst of business investment which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) gave further details of in question time today. This clearly has been pushing the current account deficit a little further than it otherwise would have been, and it will gradually return to a level of equilibrium.

         Yes, we have a problem but the magnitude of the problem is nothing like what has been suggested by the opposition. It needs to be put into some serious context. The context is nearly six per cent economic growth. There has been rapid employment growth, with 500,000 jobs having been created since the government was re-elected in 1993, a year ahead of the target that we set and which many ridiculed as simply impossible. There has been a 40 per cent increase in competitiveness since the government was first elected in 1983 and a 24 per cent increase in business investment. Real incomes have risen; irrespective of the sort of stuff that is said by some on the opposition benches, it is a fact. Low inflation has been sustained. The Australian dollar is still reasonably stable in the middle to low US70c range. There is clear evidence of structural economic change. This latest information, with respect to the contract signed by Toyota with countries in the Middle East, is yet another very good example of that.

In fact, we can probably dream up a few additional items of expenditure'—including such nonsense as pensions for everybody at an additional cost of $5 billion. At the same time as all this, they are going to cut the current account deficit by some sort of magical process.

         Something very strange is going on over the other side, Mr Deputy Speaker. You might have noticed that today, when the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), walked in, he looked a little bit taller. There was a distinct pout in the lips, the bum was sticking out a bit more, the chest was sticking out a bit more and there was a little bit of a blue tinge in the hair. Do you know what is going on? The opposition leader is turning into Andrew Peacock. John Howard is turning into Andrew Peacock! The great problem for the Liberals is that the legacy of Andrew Peacock—

         —My apologies—the opposition leader is turning into the former member for Kooyong. The Liberal Party has had the former member for Kooyong's legacy hanging around its neck throughout the 1980s and now the 1990s even when he was not the leader. In 1987 he flirted with the Joh for Canberra campaign to help undermine the campaign by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In 1993 the Liberals decided to stay away from Andrew Peacock and, for a change, have a serious policy, but then they ran an Andrew Peacock election campaign and they lost.

We'll have a think about those sorts of things.' `Oh, we didn't really support the third runway.' `The land fund?

         On this issue he is a man with a past—like on every other issue. As was pointed out earlier in this debate, when he was last in office as Treasurer our current account deficit was about 5 1/2 per cent of GDP—roughly the same as it is now. Where is the distinction? What is the difference?

         The difference is this: there was 10 per cent plus unemployment; 10 per cent plus inflation; business investment was dying; and interest rates were substantially higher than they are now.

         It is relevant to make these comparisons. It is true that a fair amount of time has gone by since then. Nonetheless, these comparisons are relevant. When he was in charge he had a current account deficit as bad as the contemporary current account deficit. But where were all the other good economic indicators that this government has been able to deliver? Where were the sorts of economic indicators that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) sneers at? Like the 500,000 new jobs that have been created. Like the prolonged low inflation. Where were those economic indicators in the early 1980s?

         We have a leader who has turned himself into a policy fraud. The honourable member for Bennelong had some integrity in the 1980s because he stood for a hard right position, he articulated it and he kicked some heads in his party in order to do so—one of the reasons why the honourable member for Goldstein is here and not his predecessor. But now he is running away from it and descending into pure, populist nonsense and today was a very good example of precisely that.

         Instead of engaging in the substance of the debate, instead of looking at the detailed factors of our current account deficit problem, it is pure, unadulterated populism. No serious economic analysis. Unlike his counterpart in Victoria, Jeff Kennett, when the election is called he will not be able to get away with going to the electorate with no policies. The member for Bennelong will not be able to get away with just simply presenting himself and saying, `Australia's got problems, and here I am. Aren't I wonderful? Please vote for me.'

         So, when looking at the current account deficit problem, yes, it is a problem. But you have to look at the total picture. You also have to look at short-term factors that are exacerbating the problem and that will alter. You have to look at the track record of the people opposite and see how much credibility they have in dealing with this issue. The answer is: not very much at all. To the extent that they had any credibility at all, it is rapidly dwindling as a result of the stance that they are taking.

        By a broad application of the current conditions, it has been possible to import, duty free, most goods used in aircraft. The government has now decided to restrict the coverage of this item by excluding textiles and goods made of textiles for use on aircraft. This initiative will remove the competitive advantage previously accorded imported goods over locally sourced goods. It will also encourage the use of Australian raw textile materials. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.

         —Before interruption of the debate, I was speaking about the major contribution to the Northern Territory and Australian economies that the mining sector makes, and how this benefits Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Consequently, the question of access to land for exploration is one that will concern all Australians. In this context, it is instructive to review the status of exploration licences over Aboriginal freehold land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.

         As of 31 January this year, the Northern Territory minister had given consent for applicants to commence negotiations on 606 exploration licence applications since the proclamation of the Commonwealth act in 1976. Of the 606 licence applications, a total of 51 have been granted under the Northern Territory Mining Act. A further 14 have received approval by the relevant land council and the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and are awaiting grant. As well, 157 proposals for exploration have been vetoed, leaving 211 currently considered by the land councils.

         I do not dispute for a moment that many of these applications will have had complex implications and that their consideration and negotiation are no doubt subject to unforeseen delays and difficulties. But, with only 8.4 per cent of exploration proposals granted, one has to at least question whether the act is providing Aborigines and other Australians with the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of mining ventures. This is especially so when you consider the high risk and low rate of successful commercial discoveries from mineral exploration.

         As I said earlier in the debate, the 1987 amendments to the act were intended to ease the situation of land access for mineral exploration by removing the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they previously agreed to exploration and by imposing time limits on the decision process. Unfortunately, there is significant doubt as to whether these amendments actually benefit any of the groups involved in the process. On the surface, the amendments seem to provide more certainty for mining interests in that they have a clear decision time frame and are not faced with the possibility of having invested heavily in exploration only to find the mining denied.

         The traditional owners have to make a decision to allow exploration and mining before the results are known. At times this makes revenue, employment benefits and disadvantages from mining very difficult to accurately quantify—sometimes impossible. Traditional owners will tend to be more hesitant to allow exploration on their land, resulting in fewer and more complex agreements. There are undoubtedly cases where a less constrained negotiation would have resulted in an agreement and the benefits of mining accrue to all parties. The opportunity to go the extra mile and reach a negotiated outcome beneficial to both parties is vital to the goal of Aboriginal economic independence and a healthy resources industry. In 1991, the Industry Commission commented:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Negotiations without artificial external constraints would seem far more likely to result in mutually satisfactory agreements which adequately address the main concerns of both Aborigines and those of developers.

       <para>
        To my mind, there is no question that negotiation is the key to unlocking the benefits of mineral wealth for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. There is a vital need for greater freedom for negotiation between the traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory and mining interests.

         In advocating this, I am not suggesting that the powers of traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory to determine their future and the future of their land should be weakened. The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments have a duty of care to ensure that such negotiations are effective, fairly conducted and of benefit to all parties directly involved as well as to the wider community. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that all parties have as clear an understanding as possible of the implications of their actions and any agreement that may be reached.

         In the last few years, the power of negotiation and communication to cut through decades of mistrust has been impressive. For example, in 1993 the mining company Zapopan and the Jawoyn Association reached agreement over native title issues for the proposed $100 million Mount Todd goldmine, which is 50 kilometres north of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The successful conclusion of the negotiation process provides an important model for resolving other issues of this nature and followed a lengthy history of claims around the site.

         In 1978, a traditional land claim was lodged on land in and around Katherine by the Jawoyn. When the land commissioner presented a report on the claim in 1987, the area of the Mount Todd mine was specifically excluded from the grant of land. Shortly after that report, two repeat land claims, which included the Mount Todd area, were lodged.

         Following the Mabo decision in 1992, Zapopan sought legal opinion on the effect of the decision on the proposed mine, recognising the possibility of further native title claims to the area. Then, in November 1992, ongoing discussions between the company and the Jawoyn Association, which had been primarily concerned with employment and contract opportunities, became focused on the issue of land rights.

         The Mount Todd result was truly a win-win situation for all concerned. It is worth commenting that the issue of land rights and native title was resolved in only three months of discussion between the parties, which compares very unfavourably with the delays experienced under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the Native Title Act. I have no doubt that outcomes, such as those of the Mount Todd negotiations, have resulted from an increased awareness by developers of the importance of issues of native title and Aboriginal advancement, while Aborigines see the economic and social benefits of employment, infrastructure and income that result from successful mining ventures.

         One very pertinent issue associated with the successful Mount Todd agreement is the topic of representation of the traditional owners of land in negotiation with mining companies. At present, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act requires negotiation to be conducted through the appropriate land council. In recent times, a number of traditional owners have queried the activities of the land councils in representing their interests. While I do not want to pursue it at this time by detailing their claims, I note the difficulty of effective negotiation occurring when there is disagreement of this nature.

         It is heartening to see the progress made by the mining committee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in achieving mutual understanding of the position of miners and Aborigines on mining matters. As a result, a new committee—the Joint Council on Aboriginal Land and Mining—is to be established. A further significant development in this regard has been the decision by Aboriginal groups to join the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines. The Jawoyn Association joined the chamber last year and, recently, Yirrkala Business Enterprises and the Gagadju Contracting Company became members. I look forward to further developments such as these in finding the common ground for Aborigines, miners and the community to benefit from mining on Aboriginal land.

        Despite the success of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act making it possible for Aboriginal people to regain control of their traditional lands, NT Government opposition to land claims and the existence of guidelines which prevent the delivery of services to small remote communities, limit the extent to which access to land can achieve meaningful improvements in the living standards of remote Aboriginal people . . . if health conditions, in particular, show no improvement because of poor water supplies, for example, then the ability of the community to take control of its own affairs will be seriously weakened.

        The government's focus now will be to try to right the wrongs, having given rights and access to land through the High Court Mabo decision on native title and the land fund bill in spite of opposition from those opposite and a lack of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard).

         The opposition leader has shown a disastrous inability to come to terms with a position of moral integrity on Aboriginal land rights. We saw an example of that most recently in the Hindmarsh Island debacle. He sat on his hands knowing full well that his then shadow minister for the environment, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), had perpetrated many wrongs in his misuse and misappropriation of those documents. The opposition leader came into this House with the current opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and sat on his hands and did nothing. He did not show any leadership. He did not sack his frontbench person. Finally, when public furore forced the resignation of the opposition spokesperson for the environment, the Leader of the Opposition said he was an honourable man. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) has said, `We must have him back in the shadow ministry because we cannot afford to lose his talent and ability.'

         Unfortunately, this is the sort of moral integrity that we always get from the Liberal-National Party coalition in spite of the several good people on the opposition benches—usually on the back benches—who have the best interests of Aboriginal people at heart. There is only one government that will work with the Aboriginal people to get to the future: a Labor government. The Aboriginal people know it and the media know it. On any assessment of the debate, we have always given moral leadership and effective legislative leadership. This amendment is further evidence of that. We will not leave Aboriginal people behind. We will make sure that they get their justice, infrastructure and enough support to make land rights work for them in the Northern Territory and elsewhere.

         —I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) because the Aboriginal lands are of great interest to me, in particular because my electorate contains the Pitjantjatjara and Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Further, I spent a significant amount of my early life in the Northern Territory working on various pastoral properties and enjoying the tropical way of life in Darwin.

         As some preliminary comments, I would like to try to put a regional Australian's point of view on Aboriginal matters. We must be very careful that we do not get caught up too much in our own rhetoric. We must be very honourable in the way that we conduct our affairs regarding the original inhabitants of this fine country of ours, because I have a feeling that too many times in the parliament Aboriginal people have been exploited for political purposes. At a time in our history when we must aim for a cooperative and integrated society based on non-racial grounds, we must be very careful that we bring the whole country with us in any reforms or any changes that we make.

         In speaking as a regional Australian, I would like to remind the House that Aboriginal people inhabited every square kilometre of this land. Yet, in the native title issue, we find that it is only ever regional Australia that gets caught up in the practical detail. We do know that only five per cent of Aboriginal people—if, indeed, five per cent are fortunate enough—will have an opportunity to access land through the native title legislation. We also need to look at the white people who live in regional Australia because, there again, we have a minority group. There are perhaps 10 per cent or five per cent of white people living in regional Australia who will be in any way affected by the issues of land.

When asked in a perfectly friendly and cordial meeting how many native title claims had been put forward, he said he thought that about 60 had been put forward and 35 had been accepted by the tribunal, but none had been finalised—that is, none had finally come to fruition and been accepted as native title leases.

         This committee, when visiting the west, went to a local government area, or shire, as it is known there, which has about a 50 per cent Aboriginal population base. About 90 per cent of the intake of the district hospital is Aboriginal. There is a 50 per cent Aboriginal population base but a 90 per cent Aboriginal involvement as clients in the hospital. A whole range of issues flows from that, but the main point I would like to make now is that the state is at the front line of providing that service. It is no good—no good at all—for the Commonwealth to engage in constant carping criticism of the states when the states are expected to pick up a disproportionate share of the burden. We need to look at the task, break down the boundaries—whether Commonwealth, state, local or Aboriginal—and see how we can best cooperate. The whole debate has a long way to go.

         Despite the fact that the federal government believes that returning land to Aboriginal communities will somehow solve their problems, we can see from the example of the Pitjantjatjara experience that land alone is not a solution. The Maralinga Tjarutja lands provide their own unique story because of the British nuclear testing that took place there in the 1950s and 1960s. I visited Maralinga last month with the parliamentary Public Works committee to assess the first stages of the clean-out process. That is in 1990s terms. Of course, there have been significant clean-up operations since the tests of the 1950s and 1960s. This is, hopefully, the finalisation of that process.

         My underlying concern with Aboriginal lands is that the communities that live there must be given every fair opportunity to develop the land and to genuinely take control of their own lives. There are, no doubt, hundreds of reasons why this has not taken place to any significant degree in the Pitjantjatjara lands and the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Some of these go right back to the root problems of European habitation of our country, urban paternalism and, as I have mentioned already, the inability of the Commonwealth and the states to focus sufficiently well on the issue. Sadly, too often, there is also too much political exploitation of the Aboriginal issue.

         I come back to the Pitjantjatjara lands. There are fundamental differences between what the Aboriginal community wants and what the government bureaucracy delivers. Many homes were built on the lands. However, a lot of the homes that I have seen have been destroyed or vandalised or are uninhabited. While there have been numerous calls for greater spending on Aboriginal housing, we must first ask ourselves why past housing in areas such as the Pitjantjatjara lands was destroyed or was inappropriate. Some good work has been done but we must apply the research in a very practical way.

         In speaking to people on the housing issue, I know that the housing provided was not exactly what the Aboriginal people wanted. There is still plenty of room for much improved communication in planning those homes. I offer this example. Many traditional Aboriginal people like to sleep outdoors. When some of the homes were built, families found they preferred to sleep on the front porch. However, the front porch, if there was one, was not always located on the right side of the house. For example, it may have faced the hot sun. This is one example of homes not being suitable for the Aboriginal way of living. It needs to be reinforced time and time again that practical solutions do exist and that it is for all of us, to the best of our ability, to make sure that we apply those practical solutions.

         I address my remarks to the question of Hodgson Downs because it is important that we understand the significance of this particular block of land for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory which, of course, is in my electorate. The first thing that should be said is that Hodgson Downs is an extremely important ritual centre for the whole of the Roper River area. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Northern Territory, that is an extensive area of country to the east and south-east of Katherine in the Northern Territory.

         The dreamings that pass through the property make it very important for the whole of the Northern Territory. In cultural terms, in sacred terms for Aboriginal people, it is of primary importance.

         Sadly, a number of the people who were very well known as ritual leaders, both women and men, have died between the preparation of the claim and the negotiations which settled it. Unfortunately, that seems often to be the case. There are and there have been claims outstanding in the Northern Territory for over a decade primarily—not in this case, but in most cases—as a result of the resistance of the Northern Territory government to the rights of Aboriginal people under the land rights act.

         What they have done is try to frustrate any attempts by Aboriginal people to obtain land under the act continually, which has often meant that primary claimants—principal claimants—have passed away during the period from the lodgment of the claims and the claim being finally settled.

         Hodgson Downs was purchased as a pastoral lease and then claimed by Aboriginal claimants. As a result of the claim process it became Aboriginal land under the land rights act, thus our amendment this afternoon.

         The great importance of this amendment today is that the strength of the spiritual attachment to the land has been recognised and respected in the legislation. That respect was incorporated in the legislation, which significantly was prepared initially by the Whitlam government and subsequently, although amended by the Fraser government, put into force by a conservative coalition government in this country. The Fraser government needs to be congratulated for having the foresight to carry on the work of the Whitlam government to pass this piece of legislation, which was based on recommendations of Justice Woodward in his royal commission report. For those on the opposition benches who have reservations about the importance of Aboriginal land and how it should be dealt with, I commend to them their reading of that report.

        I, as a non-Aboriginal Australian, as a Northern Territory citizen, as a citizen of this country, am concerned at those sorts of views being expressed by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. When discussing the issue of social justice in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, 10 May 1994, and when referring to issues relating to the provision of services to meet the disadvantage of Aboriginal people in this country, the Chief Minister said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is it social justice that provides benefits to some based on racial ancestry which others pay for but are not entitled to?
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the attitude of the Northern Territory Chief Minister—an attitude which, frankly, I regard as racist; an attitude which is replicated in his statements time and again about the issue of land rights. That attitude is not shared by some of our opponents here. I was delighted this afternoon to hear the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), when referring to this land rights legislation, which was passed after development by the Whitlam and Fraser governments—and they deserve due credit for it—say that the Liberal Party is proud and justifiably so of it. His pride, his satisfaction, his endorsement—and I hope the endorsement of the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)—are not shared by the CLP or by Marshall Perron.

         Comment has been made in this debate in this past week about reports, particularly about Mick Dodson's second report as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. He makes particular reference to the issue of land acquisition. I think it is important that we understand this in the context of this debate because this was about the purchase of a property which was ultimately transferred into Aboriginal title as a result of a land claim process. Mr Dodson states:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Aboriginal land acquisition programmes, for instance, are constantly being criticised—

       <para>
        we know they are, by the Northern Territory CLP government, as I have already illustrated, and by sections of industry—

       <para font-size="-=2">
        for not being primarily directed towards maximising monetary profit . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That is Shane Stone's line. Mr Dodson continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such criticisms indicate a failure to understand or respect the fact that Indigenous peoples may place just as great a value on their social and cultural wellbeing as they do on economic gain. What is at issue here is the practical application of the right to self-determination and, specifically, the non-Indigenous system's willingness to surrender control of the way in which Indigenous peoples manage and develop their resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to make a comment on the assessment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's land acquisition package. I quote from that assessment:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There was very high satisfaction with the movement of kin to remote properties, considerable satisfaction with the levels of harmony achieved, and on cultural matters, high satisfaction with the establishment of outstations, the protection of significant areas of land and with culturally appropriate schooling.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is very important. I just want to quote from the report of Pat Dodson from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in which he says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of general principles can be derived as to what rights Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would wish to see recognised, in the legal framework, so that there is appropriate empowerment to ensure that these rights can actually be accessed by indigenous communities and organisations. These principles might be set out:

        That range of issues is in part directly addressed by the Northern Territory land rights legislation—a very important piece of legislation. I would think it is one of the key pieces of social legislation passed in the history of this parliament and passed on a bipartisan basis. It was initially developed by the Whitlam government and finally passed by the Fraser government, based on the reports of the Woodward commission.

         It is something which is being supported in this chamber by the opposition. It is something which, most significantly for the people in the Northern Territory, for those people who are subject to this legislation, is not supported by the conservative Country-Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory. That should concern all Australians. If we are to strive towards reconciliation, if we are to accept difference and diversity, if we are to accept the importance and significance of Aboriginal cultural and heritage values and if we are to accept and take pride in the spirituality of Aboriginal heritage, what we should be saying to the Northern Territory government is: `Get your act together. You're an international embarrassment. You're a shame on Australia for not supporting this very key piece of social legislation,' which, as Pat Dodson has said, gives people a priority.

         —in reply—I would like to say some relatively brief words in summing up the debate that has ensued in respect of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) before the House. I note that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made a very important contribution highlighting the policies of the Northern Territory government as they relate to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.

         I should say for the record that my recollection is there are some 30 Federal Court or High Court challenges that have been launched in respect of intended grants or in respect of land claims hearings under the Northern Territory land rights act by the Northern Territory government. Of those 30 legal actions, my recollection is that, at best, only one-half of one of those cases has, in fact, been successful. What we have seen is tens of millions of dollars of public money over a very long time used to thwart the finalisation of land claims. Regrettably, that process of frustration has led to the death of a great many traditional owners who have not been able to see the ultimate return of their traditional country. To those of us in the parliament who have been privileged to be either directly involved, as ministers or as observers, in the return of traditional land under the Northern Territory land rights act, it is a deeply moving experience. I do not think I have been to one single land title return where the traditional owners have not wept with a mixture of joy and sadness on that occasion. Often, the sadness is because of those who are no longer with them to witness that great occasion.

         Having said that, it is important to put on record that this is a very positive piece of legislation and a very positive development that we see the land council, the Northern Territory government and, indeed, the Commonwealth parliament unanimously coming together to settle and resolve one of the outstanding land claims. This is how we, as a nation and as governments, should transact business and regulate our dealings with indigenous people. If we can settle claims, if we can negotiate a successful outcome, it is a far better approach than litigating at great cost to the whole community, including the non-Aboriginal community, and at great personal cost.

         One of the things I have been very pleased to be deeply involved in during my time as a minister is trying to address the backlog of land claims under the Northern Territory land rights act; that is, those claims where there has been a land commissioner's report but no decision has been taken in respect of a return of the country. It happened through various reasons—I do not think it was the fault of any minister—that some of the land claims had been effectively outstanding for the best part of a decade or more. We now have a position where we are virtually up to date with all the land commissioners' reports. With minor exceptions, they have now been acted on, proper decisions taken and the land returned. That is how the land rights act should work for indigenous people and for the wider community.

         The member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) made an important contribution on behalf of the coalition. What he said, in response to a comment I made in the course of his speech, was that the coalition was committed to the retention of the veto under the Northern Territory land rights act. That, of course, was the very issue which led the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) into the troubled sands of the central Australian deserts in the course of last year. It was the issue of whether there was going to be a repeal of that veto provision or not that regrettably caused him and the wider community so much confusion. Today, we have an important statement from the shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Gippsland, committing the coalition to the retention of that veto.

We are agreeing about some important principles. The return of land to its traditional owners is a very important measure of social justice.

It worked well for him as the shadow minister and it worked well for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Regrettably, after the 1993 election, the coalition took a very big step away from that cross-party cooperation.

         It is not my intention to recanvass what has sometimes been described as the Mabo debate, which was a pretty sad and sorry time in Australian political history. The Mabo debate concluded in the most dramatic way by a 7:0 decision by the High Court of Australia in upholding the validity of the Native Title Act. We now see a genuine sea change in the attitudes of not only key people in the community but also very significant sections of the Australian mining industry.

         This change was reflected in the statement by Mr Leon Davis, the managing director of CRA. When he recognised the significance of the Native Title Act, he indicated that his company could work with that legislation and, of even more significance, he indicated a commitment to negotiate with Aboriginal people. Again the shadow minister for resources highlighted the importance of that negotiation. He spoke of the agreement that had been achieved in respect of the Mount Todd goldmine in the Northern Territory, where the NT government negotiated with Aboriginal people and with the company in question, Zapopan, with the support of the Commonwealth. We had an outcome there that gave the title of that land to Aboriginal people and got the goldmine off the ground, but very importantly it gave Aboriginal people an economic interest in the region and in the development of the mine proposal. This need to move to equal negotiations with and mutual respect of Aboriginal people in the mining industry is one of the most important agendas for corporate Australia.

         Until Mr Davis made that statement, CRA, to be very frank, did not have a recognised good public track record in dealing with indigenous people. It is sad, but I think it is true to say that. I am so full of hope that Mr Davis's statement will be further reflected in the range of initiatives and policies taken by CRA that will make that company a pacesetter in the Australian mining industry in its dealings with indigenous people. I think the statement is a bona fide one and one that comes with considerable commitment from the chief executive.

         I want to say a couple of other things before I finish up. There have been some very significant developments elsewhere in trying to achieve a greater degree of cross-party cooperation. In this parliament today we had formed a group called `Parliamentarians for reconciliation'. Its conveners are Senator Reynolds from Queensland and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a former shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I hope that that group can play a constructive role in the parliament in building cross-party cooperation. That does not mean that issues of principle are not going to be defended, fought for and upheld. I think, if we do have rational debates about issues of policy, it is possible to get that very large measure of cross-party cooperation. It gives me no joy whatsoever to have issues of Aboriginal affairs policy the subject of bitter division.

         I thank the House for its generosity in allowing me to explore a number of related issues mostly raised in the course of debate. Another important area where we need to work with great wisdom as parliamentarians and to approach in the most constructive and open-hearted manner possible is the important issue of social policy, the third stage of the response to the High Court decision in the form of the social justice package. There has already been a report from ATSIC advocating proposals; there will be a report from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner; and there is a report by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.

        The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 will assist the government in ensuring that Australia is fulfilling its treaty obligations and its citizens do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in any part of the world.

         Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the government. International recognition of the horrific results of the use of weapons of mass destruction—nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems—and concerns over the destabilising impact of the proliferation of such weapons have resulted in several major achievements in addressing this problem. Of greatest importance are the multilateral treaties either banning or restricting the proliferation of such weapons, principally the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the biological weapons convention and the chemical weapons convention, which is not yet in force.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition to these global treaties, and reinforcing their objectives, are other measures which have been taken to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, WMD. In concert with other similarly minded countries, the Australian government has maintained a range of export controls aimed at preventing the transfer, directly or indirectly, of goods and technology, which could be used in the development of WMD, to programs known to be or suspected of posing a WMD proliferation risk. These controls were developed by international export control regimes of which Australia is a member—the nuclear suppliers group and the Zangger committee (nuclear), the Australia group (chemical and biological) and the missile technology control regime (missile delivery systems).

         Australia's export controls on goods, including technology in a tangible form, are covered by the Customs Act 1901 through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Exports of dual use materials and technology, equipment and technology which have both commercial and military uses, are controlled under a series of these regulations.

         It is not possible to identify and describe, for regulatory purposes, all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the customs regulations: once in regulations, all exports of these items would require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The customs regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could for example take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program; financial assistance; brokering the supply of materials; or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the customs regulations.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the catch-all or safety net provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation, for example, the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways. It puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. While there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation. Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the government informed them of its concerns. We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs; hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy.

         The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows of or suspects the connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program, but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the government on the risk, or not, of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program.

         As the Assistant Treasurer said, the general purpose of the bill is to restrict trade in any materials likely to be used in weapons of mass destruction, the so-called WMDs, which describes nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capable of resulting in mass destruction of the population. The bill does so by levying penalties for export of goods which may be used for the construction of such WMDs, with a couple of strong qualifiers that it only covers exports where a person believes or suspects on reasonable grounds that goods will or may be used in a WMD program, and also that its broad framework allows normal exports and allows for clarification by the minister if doubt exists.

         I suppose the basic question that we should all be addressing this evening is: why, therefore, should all Australians support this bill? I suggest that there are five reasons why we should do just that. Firstly, it recognises a general repugnance of any proliferation post-Cold War of such weapons. Secondly, it signals a very specific commitment to the associated international treaties. Thirdly, its strong theme strengthens and reinforces our attitude to an indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty at the NPT review and extension conference in New York next month, between 17 April and 12 May. Fourthly, it exemplifies Australia's commitment to regional stability by showing the strength of our own commitment to non-proliferation. Finally, it is very consistent with last year's defence white paper. I take the opportunity to refer to that defence white paper, specifically to pages 108 and 109, under the heading `Non-Proliferation and Arms Control'. I quote:

        Effective controls on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles contribute significantly to Australia's security. Twenty years or more of sustained negotiation between the then superpowers and in multilateral forums have led to the development of an unprecedented array of non-proliferation and arms control regimes (particularly the Strategic Arms Limitations Agreement and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the Treaty Banning Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty—

However, with the end of the Cold War, economic growth and strategic uncertainties have increased the potential for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

         Australia shares a global interest in reducing the risk of countries acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We have a strong direct interest in ensuring that such weapons are not acquired by countries or terrorist groups which could use them against Australia. While the mere acquisition of these weapons would not indicate a threat to Australia, their existence within reach of us would complicate and add to the cost of our defence. Furthermore, if one regional country acquires weapons of mass destruction or missile capabilities other regional countries may respond, possibly by developing matching capabilities. Such a sequence would destabilise regional security and further complicate defence planning. The best way to prevent proliferation is to establish effective global regimes, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. Australia will continue to support and if possible strengthen these regimes, and ensure they are fully implemented and effectively verifiable. Defence will continue to promote and implement regional non-proliferation and arms control measures.

         A key priority is limiting the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The Government will continue its efforts to make the Missile Technology Control Regime an effective mechanism for this purpose, and will seek the broadest international commitment to controls on developing and exporting ballistic missile technology. Our involvement in international processes will be complemented by continued efforts to secure acceptance of, and adherence to, this Regime within the region.

        In this context, it is appropriate that we should review Australia's track record on these issues. I point out, for those who are not aware of it, that we are party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons—the so-called NPT, which I would like to comment on in a little more detail later—was ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973, and was substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. We also have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and their Destruction. This was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, and was substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, we have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. It is therefore quite unambiguous that these three treaties and their associated legislation place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material.

         In addition, Australia is involved in four relevant international groups which aim to control the international transfer of weapons grade materials. The first of these groups is the Zangger committee, which was formed in the early 1970s by countries which supply nuclear materials and which have developed a list of equipment, the export of which should be subject to safeguards. The overall aim of this group is to develop controls on the export of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. The second of these groups is the nuclear suppliers group, which was formed in 1974. This group has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear related equipment and technology which is aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

         The third group is the missile technology control regime, which was referred to in the extract I read into the record from the defence paper of last year. That group was established in 1987. It comprises a group of countries which have agreed to a basic set of guidelines on the export of missile technology, and these guidelines are incorporated into national export regulations. Finally, there is the Australia group, which was established in 1987 to facilitate a chemical weapons treaty. It deals with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. It has also developed a list of chemicals which require export controls.

         It is therefore pretty clear that Australia's record is very good.

Export controls have been imposed also through the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations under the Customs Act 1901. Clearly, we are playing an important role in these matters.

         This raises the issue of our reservations about the bureaucratic demands and potential legal risks of the bill I referred to in opening this debate. The bill imposes additional burdens on companies to become aware of the ultimate use of goods or services that they might provide or export. Although the criminal provisions require a level of intent of belief or suspicion, a jury could attribute suspicion to a company if it held or had access to information which indicates that the goods or services might be used for a WMD program, even if nobody in the company had actually turned his or her mind to it. The company must also take care that none of its directors, employees or agents hold suspicions without alerting the responsible person in the company. Otherwise, the knowledge of the director, employee or agent could be attributed to the company, and this could result in conviction, a fine and confiscation of the goods.

         I would like to say a few words about the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons—the so-called NPT—which provides the international framework for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT, along with the UN charter, are the key documents on international security. The NPT was concluded in 1968 and entered into force in 1970 after ratification by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom—the so-called depositary powers of the treaty—and 40 other states. One of the broad objectives of the treaty is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons to states other than the five states which had already developed nuclear weapons in 1968. These states are United States, the Soviet Union—Russia has since acceded to these obligations—the United Kingdom, France and China. Other objectives are to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation between treaty members, and to work towards general and complete nuclear disarmament.

         In the coalition's view, the NPT has become vital to global and regional security. It provides essential assurances for international trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Without the assurances offered by the NPT and the system of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, distrust of nuclear intentions would feed regional security problems. Without the assurances offered by the NPT, international nuclear cooperation would dwindle.

This review process will be an important part of the 1995 conference in New York and, despite disappointing progress on disarmament during the Cold War years, the review conferences have nevertheless provided a forum for the international community to continue to maintain pressure on the nuclear weapon states to stop nuclear testing, to halt the arms race and to start nuclear reductions. But much more productive has been the work of successive review conferences in strengthening other key provisions of the treaty, including safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear supply, and recommendations for complementary nuclear agreements and arrangements.

As I said before, that means extending the treaty indefinitely. Anything less would only provide arguments to those who wish to see the disarmament process go no further.

         We need to commence and conclude negotiations for a ban on the production of special fissionable materials for weapons purposes and the entry into force of such an agreement. At the moment, there is still a significant production of special fissionable materials occurring around the world. Stockpiles of that material are being made available.

There is no need for any member state to have nuclear weapons. Over the next 10 years, every nuclear weapon state should be engaged in a process of destroying their nuclear weapons. It is in the best interests of all member states to do that. Removing those weapons not only ends the tension and the threat to all civilisation but also saves countries money.

Parliamentarians for Global Action, which I convene in this Australian parliament, supports a project called the World Court project, which is a case before the International Court of Justice to declare nuclear weapons illegal. That case does not have the support of the Australian government but it does have the support of many other countries and many parliamentarians and people around the world.

It was a great pleasure for me to meet and work alongside Mr Ian Cousins, who is the First Assistant Secretary of the International Security Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who heads the Australian delegation in negotiations on the extension review of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. He is a very impressive negotiator for and representative of Australia. I congratulate him and his team on the work they are doing.

This will remove the necessity for industry to pay both the interim levy and main levy during the 1994-95 financial year. In addition, the NRA will be able to approve levy payments by instalments, thus spreading the cost to industry over a period of time.

In the first few years of the corporation's operation, when there were only a small number of industries participating in the corporation, this approach worked well. However, with nine industries now participating in the corporation, the chairperson of the corporation has been required to undertake a significant additional workload. This workload is likely to increase again in the short term as a number of other industries have signalled their intention to commence levy contributions to the corporation.

         The south-west Queensland regional strategy is a pilot project for the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. The strategy is generally consistent with the ARMCANZ approach, incorporating an integrated package of adjustment measures, including RAS, landcare, and rural counselling. The strategy was initially proposed by community based organisations which recognised the need for rural adjustment within the SWQ region, and is a real partnership between the community and governments at local, state, and Commonwealth levels.

         The federal government has been actively trying to whip up local support for restructuring—and I refer to two areas of New South Wales, the western and central west—in a way which looks to the outsider as a bottoms-up approach. But when you take a closer look at it, it is really a tops-down approach and being driven more from the federal government. The coalition does not object to the concept of the rural adjustment scheme being used on a regional area basis, but it wants to ensure that the states are in agreement with the plan and that restructuring is not imposed on an area which does not want to be restructured.

This is a practical grazier who has been grazing sheep and cattle in those very harsh mulga lands in south-west Queensland for more than 20 years. The president of that association has to be a pretty tough nut. He is going to have to stick up for those people out there and understand the problems of the community.

         The coalition's decision to send the bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee resulted from the lack of information about how the rural adjustment scheme and the regional plans would work, how they would be funded, and whether they would be constitutionally acceptable.

         During the inquiry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy said that funding for rural adjustment scheme regional plans would come from the underspends of each state—in other words, the underspent amount of each state's rural adjustment funding. The coalition is concerned at evidence given by Mr Malcolm Smith from the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria who said that the federal government wanted to impose a levy on states on top of the underspends, which would create a larger pot of money. Mr Smith correctly pointed out that the Victorian government would not be happy to provide finance for a regional restructuring plan in Queensland. He is quite correct. Quite rightly, any state that puts money into a scheme must receive the benefits for its own citizens. As I said earlier, it is the right of the state to manage the land administration arrangements of the state. The Victorian concerns were also of concern to the coalition.

         The coalition is aware that the regional restructuring area in Queensland—which is in my own electorate—appears to be welcomed by the people in that area. They were originally very supportive of the scheme. They continue to be supportive of the scheme, but they do not want to be run over by a federal government trying to impose unnecessary conditions on this very important approach to regional adjustment. They want it to be driven from the bottom up—at the grassroots level. These are the people who are out there in the paddocks in the south-west Queensland areas. No-one better understands the problem of the mulga lands or of any rural area than the people who are working it on a day-to-day basis.

         The other government amendments are to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. These amendments are to allow the Commonwealth to reimburse the states for the costs incurred by state rural adjustment scheme authorities in issuing drought exceptional circumstances certificates. These certificates play a very important role. They are certainly being widely used in my own electorate and in many parts of New South Wales. Unfortunately, they are not being issued in Victoria or in some parts of New South Wales which are in desperate need of a declaration of exceptional circumstance.

He is one of those from a drought declared area who is not carrying an exceptional circumstances declaration. In that report to the Senate the committee recommended to abolish the assets test on farm assets. Some of the evidence in that report highlights the lack of understanding of the plight of those families in rural Australia. The great tragedy of the assets test, as it is applied and as it is still being applied in this country, is that the children out there in rural Australia are being denied an education.

In many cases, there is not even a complete secondary education out there in rural Australia. I draw on the experience of my own electorate. Many towns have educational opportunities to year 10. People living in many of those rural towns have to send their children away to a regional centre to complete even secondary education. When it comes to university or tertiary education, they usually have to go to a capital city. I would like to know how on earth the government thinks that assets in a drought declared area or assets in a farm situation will constitute an ability to pay for children's education.

On this day, 5,400 students are being tripped out of any assistance in terms of Austudy support because of their parents' assets.

Quite clearly, that scheme is working well because the original loan for $40.9 million is now down to $13.3 million.

         Before I do that I would reiterate my belief—as I said yesterday in my speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (Drought Relief Measures)—that the rural adjustment scheme, and the farm household support as part of that, can only ever be a very poor second-best to sound economic policy. The point I made yesterday was that when Peter Walsh abolished the old IED scheme he should have put something in its place—as he acknowledged in December of last year. While I was angry yesterday when I remembered that and I expressed that anger in my speech, and I still feel that, at least he was honourable enough to acknowledge that he should have put something in its place.

         I welcome the efforts of the Senate rural and regional affairs committee in trying to bring a greater sense of balance to this legislation. Here we are not just dealing with markets, rationalists and export income; we are dealing with people's lives. These people have come from a great tradition over many generations. They are under great pressure, and probably have not been under greater pressure since the Great Depression—and some would say it is even greater than that. I am sure that we would wish the committee under the chairmanship of Caroline Schaefer all the best in planning for the future and developing a vision for Eyre Peninsula.

The coalition sent it to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee because there was a fear that the government may use the rural adjustment scheme to interfere in land use without consulting the states and to force people out of farming in a regional restructure, against the wishes of the local community.

         As a result of that Senate committee's dissenting report, an amendment is required. The government has moved other amendments which now have to be considered. It is these other amendments I want to talk about because one of them is anti-Victorian. The government amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 are to allow the Commonwealth to reimburse the states for the costs incurred by the state rural adjustment scheme authorities in issuing drought exceptional circumstances certificates.

It has adopted a regional approach in terms of drought, but the whole region of north central Victoria is gripped by the most dreadful drought in its history.

The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Bill McGrath, has been a very valuable ally to these farmers.

         When the original legislation came before the House, while the coalition welcomed much of it, we expressed concern about the lack of regional input into the rural adjustment scheme as it was to be amended by the legislation. In the Senate the coalition sought the referral of this legislation to a Senate committee, and it is to the credit particularly of coalition senators Crane and Panizza that the changes that we have before the House now were recommended by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The Senate committee of inquiry had its genesis in the enthusiasm the coalition had for greater cooperation between regional bodies and the government in the implementation of any form of rural assistance.

         Lest those introductory remarks seem a little too partisan, I should add that concerns about the way this legislation has been structured were not only expressed by the coalition. The Attorney-General's Department also said that it felt that the administrative arrangements laid down in these legislative changes were not clear. The amendments that are being considered tonight, referred to this chamber by the Senate, call for greater consultation between the Commonwealth bodies, the state bodies and regional bodies.

         In the administration of the rural adjustment scheme and in the RAS act arrangements, there is enthusiasm now, as a result of this call for consultation, for cooperation between the regional bodies and the administrators of the RAS act and consultation with the state governments, as they administer this form of rural assistance. This level of consultation is entirely appropriate, and the coalition believes that it should never have been necessary for the coalition to seek these amendments in the first place because the need for this sort of consultation should have been apparent to the federal government.

         All speakers dealing with this legislation have emphasised that these changes to rural assistance deal with people in need. In fact, the amendments currently being considered by the House provide an opportunity for reimbursement to the state governments where drought exceptional circumstances certificates are issued to farmers in particular need. These drought exceptional circumstances certificates allow farmers who are in need and in drought declared areas to access both drought relief payments, which they clearly need in order to put food on their tables, and, significantly, Austudy payments regardless of their assets.

They have the assets. Frequently these assets in drought declared areas cannot be sold. The assets prevent them accessing Austudy. Under the arrangements that are currently considered for drought exceptional circumstances certificates, it will be possible for them, in spite of their assets, to access Austudy. This recognises that their income is so low that, were those assets in any form other than farm assets, they would have been able to access Austudy.

It is some of Australia's prime grain growing country and certainly is South Australia's prime grain growing country. It is just north of Adelaide. It is decidedly dry. The farmers are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. They will not qualify for drought assistance. As their representative, I do not think that I can stand here and realistically claim that they should qualify. I can claim that, had the government recognised just how unpredictable farming can be, it would have taken action to maintain the income equalisation deposits scheme that the Fraser government put in place and so allow these farmers to make preparations for years such as these. My farmers are not coming to me pleading for government intervention, but it is obvious that their capacity to budget and to prepare for the downturn that they are experiencing now has been frustrated by the government's inability to provide the same sort of IED scheme as the Fraser government once had in place.

         As the member for Bendigo said, the amendment would allow those farmers who are, as my farmers are, in sufficiently difficult circumstances to qualify for the drought exceptional circumstances certificates to access Austudy. That amendment alone would cost the government a mere quarter of a million dollars, which is very little in terms of the total drought outlay and the total losses being faced by farmers who currently cannot make ends meet simply because there has been too little rain. In taking into consideration just what drought has done to Australia and how slow the government has been to respond, it is rather chastening that much of the initial work done to assist farmers was by volunteers like the CWAs across Australia and by public figures like prominent television personalities such as Ray Martin.

         What is little known is that in my state last week an initiative was launched by the premier of South Australia, Mr Dean Brown. In cooperation with the chairman of John Shearer Ltd, Andrew Gwinnett, Mr Brown launched a campaign to be known as `Seeds of hope'. The South Australian government made available $10,000. It is hoped that through public funding this $10,000 will grow to allow the John Shearer organisation to administer a fund that will enable drought stricken farmers to get, without any cost to them at all, the seeds they need to sow this year's crop. I commend John Shearer for this initiative. They are offering all the administrative arrangements without charge. I also commend the Premier of South Australia for his preparedness to be identified with the program and to make $10,000 available as foundation funding. This will mean that farmers whose situation is so desperate that they cannot afford the seed to sow this year's crop will have access to free seed and will be assured not only of a harvest his year but also of the opportunity to once again be proud and independent Australians who are able to look after their land without being dependent on handouts either of the charitable form or from governments. I think that deserves a mention and deserves commendation.

         As I deal with the legislation before the House and the changes that will occur in drought stricken Australia, let me say that the government—I could say the parliament but I guess it is fairer to say the government—in making drought assistance available to Australian farmers has probably committed Australian taxpayers to some $270 million or $300 million. If we were generous we could say $400 million. That includes funding for rural councils and all other assistance, which is difficult to measure. That seems like a reasonable sum. When you consider that it takes only the smallest movement in interest rates to cost Australian farmers billions of dollars, you begin to see not only how relatively insignificant this total package is—I do not mean that in an ungracious way—but also how essential responsible, total economic management is. If farmers had a predictable economy they would be much better able to cope with the fluctuations in weather that characterise Australian farming. My plea once again is for the government to recognise the desperate situation of farmers. They need some predictable economic circumstances and the opportunity to access an effective IED scheme. They are anxious to be independent and proud Australians.

         A matter which has not been referred to in the debate tonight because the focus has tended to be entirely on the drought is that the original bill—the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill—also included a change to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and changes to the administration and meeting obligations of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. I mention this because what is currently widely mooted in the dried fruits community and the grape wine community is the proposal advocated in the recently released draft report of the committee of inquiry into the wine and wine grape industry which suggested a change in the way in which the wine industry is taxed.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware—I know the member for Mallee is well aware of the proposal that came out; it has an immediate impact on the dried fruit industry—that there is to be a change in the taxation on wine so that a volumetric tax is imposed. The three commissioners of inquiry into the wine grape and wine industry came out with a divided report.

       <para first-indent="16">

         One commissioner brought out a minority report advocating a sales tax of 32 per cent and a volumetric tax or excise of $4 a litre. The other two commissioners brought out a majority report advocating a sales tax of 10 per cent and a volumetric tax of $4 per litre of alcohol. I mention this in the closing stages of this debate because it is significant that the one person who advocated a minority report did so recognising that a volumetric tax would impact most unfairly on what are called non-premium varieties of grapes. The dried vine fruits industry, which is covered by a part of this bill, is the principal grower of what are called non-premium varieties. I refute the term `non-premium' because it implies inferiority. That is not true at all. They are superior dried vine fruit varieties but are inferior in the eyes of winemakers; important, but inferior.

         The House needs to appreciate two things. Firstly, any form of volumetric tax, any form of excise, per litre of alcohol means that premium varieties put into, for example, a red wine at $22 a bottle, containing a certain amount of alcohol at $4 a litre, may result in an increase in the cost of that $22 bottle of, say, $4. But a cask made from the non-premium varieties also has a similar amount of alcohol in it and this would result in the price of a $5 cask increasing by $4. Clearly, that is a very inequitable way to go about taxing this industry.

         I raise this point because, if the government were to entertain any form of excise at all, it should look at what the change in excise did to the brandy industry. A graph of brandy production in Australia indicates that as excise rose across the graph brandy production fell. There is a real risk for the wine industry in the application of an excise and what it may do to the industry. But should such an excise be considered? It should not be considered unless there was an opportunity to relieve the excise on brandy and so allow some of the non-premium varieties to go back into the brandy industry because they would no longer be in demand in the wine industry. These are the very varieties that the dried fruit industry currently depends on for its export market and it sees the brandy industry as a safety valve for that industry.

       I agree with that. He tells me that the ceremony will be held at the Keswick Barracks in Adelaide on 11 April.

         In speaking to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1995, it is very important to define weapons of mass destruction. It is a term used to describe nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which are capable of resulting in mass destruction of a population. Australia is a party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was ratified in Australia on 23 January 1973, is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.

A Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force.

         I have before me a research paper published as late as March this year, entitled `Crunch Time for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'. In annex C, there are a few facts and figures about the NPT. The paper states that 173 countries are members of it and that Taiwan and Yugoslavia are not counted. It is a pity that recognition was not given to Taiwan in the United Nations, but the following 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty: Angola; Brazil; Chile; Comoros; Cuba; Djibouti; Federated States of Micronesia; India, which has a population of some 800 million; Israel, which is a small nation in the Middle East; Oman; Pakistan; Palau; United Arab Emirates; and Vanuatu. It is important to recognise that those 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty.

         This legislation implements our adherence to the treaty and, in endorsing it this way, is fully responding to our full obligations. I have also received some letters from Greenpeace. Annex D in the research paper has suggested a 25-year timetable for achieving complete nuclear disarmament. The point being made by Greenpeace is that this legislation does nothing to implement that timetable. The concern is that, without that implementation, our legislation itself could be deficient and the treaty certainly could be. Greenpeace's news release states:

        Clearly, though, the Nuclear Weapons States have not kept their part of the "bargain". Since the NPT came into force in 1970, the arsenals of the Nuclear Weapons States have increased massively. 75,000 new nuclear weapons have been deployed and hundreds of nuclear tests conducted.

        A member of Non-Nuclear Weapon State signatories, such as Indonesia and Mexico, now want to strengthen the disarmament commitments in the NPT by introducing a timetable or set goals for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Their proposals would see the NPT extended for fixed periods, such as five years, with disarmament goals to be met within these periods.

        It goes very much back to the timetable within that. It does highlight a particular point on disarmament right across the world in that, as circumstances vary over time, we adopt one standard and then move on to another. Certainly, the big variance in this regard is the ending of the Cold War, the pulling down of the Berlin Wall and the fragmentation of the USSR into many smaller nations, Russia still being the most predominant. It allows a different set of circumstances.

         As I understand it, some of the 13 nations that previously were part of the USSR—I will not say all of them—now have access to nuclear weapons. Also, we know there is a problem in that, in the disarming of some of those nuclear weapons, they might be transferred to other countries which might be non-signatories or signatories. The important point to make is that, as I understand it, the signing of a treaty does not necessarily commit a country to adhering to the principles of a treaty. Clause 7 sets out the constitutional basis of the bill. It relies on the following constitutional powers:

        It is very important to note that it is the external affairs power of the constitution that enables us to adhere to our treaty commitments by virtue of this bill. It might seem very grand that 173 countries are members of the NPT but, of those 173 countries, how many have individually legislated—as Australia has—through their external affairs power to actually put this into force?

         I think it is very important that, while a lot of people see a treaty signed as being cast in concrete and having particular powers, it does not have the power until it is legislated in the government of the member country. While we are adhering to it, how many of these other countries that are signatories are yet to do it? My particular concern—and I think it would be the concern of everyone—is the manner in which the nuclear weapons of mass destruction in the former areas of Russia are being treated. I am particularly concerned because we know there are countries throughout the world that are very anxious to increase their nuclear weapons. I mentioned India, which is a non-signatory. There is also Iraq and a number of other countries, including North Korea, which was a crisis point last year. The Greenpeace document says that Indonesia and Mexico have a particular interest in this.

         I was fortunate to be selected by this parliament, along with the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), to represent the Australian parliament at the 49th General Assembly.

         I suggest that Australia very strongly support the Indonesian and Mexican situation to ensure that a timetable is there. The protagonists of such a move were some of the present nuclear states. We mentioned five of the nuclear states. I believe that some of those were resistant to the lodging of a timetable. I agree with Greenpeace that we need a definite timetable within the treaty and all countries to become partners to that obligation by legislating, as we have done here.

         As far as treaties are concerned, my experience with the United Nations is that you can sign treaties but they are not binding outside the UN. The UN has no power of enforcement. I think it is very important to realise that some countries—for example, France—will sign and endorse all treaties. But France does not adhere to any of the treaties of the United Nations. Again I ask: to what extent has France legislated to make it enforceable on itself?

         On the other hand, the United Nations can give many examples of countries that will not sign treaties but will adhere to most of them. To put that in context, while we are legislating to bind Australia, its citizens and its corporations to this treaty, it does not necessarily mean that there is a grand world out there where the UN has an enforcement capacity. It does not. The only enforcement capacity comes from the inside.

         I have mentioned the Cold War. Just this year, the Public Works Committee was privileged to examine the Maralinga site with a view to approving work there to reduce the danger that still exists from plutonium-contaminated sand and other material. At the time it all happened, science was not even able to experiment with these devices, let alone treat the consequences of them. When you go out there now, you appreciate that somebody is trying to do something in a modern context with modern technology to ensure that the situation is controlled. I do not think we should look over our shoulder and cast all the blame on the Brits, the French, the Americans or anyone else who worked on this technology at that earlier time.

         For their part in the discussions held at the 49th assembly, I have to pay particular tribute to Richard Starr and the other members of the Australian team who came over from Geneva. They put their hearts and souls into it, working almost 24 hours a day while they were there to get an agreement on adherence to a timetable for the Mexican-Indonesian situation. I have to say that Australians are regarded almost as a neutral factor in a lot of the things that happen at the United Nations because, although we are attached to the Europeans, we are isolated in the Southern Hemisphere. Everything on which Australia takes a view is listened to. We are regarded as one of the arbitrators within the United Nations, getting agreement between different factions. In the discussions on weapons of mass destruction and in the agreements drawn up, Australia was a lively and well-briefed participant and our views were well regarded.

         It was also interesting to see that the UN is very lively now that the Republicans have the majority in the US Congress and are renewing the call for sovereign rights. That is something that is applicable to Australia. I have no problem with the use of the external affairs power in this instance, but the Americans are asking how far they can let their sovereignty go to organisations within the UN. While I was there it was suggested that America's share of the UN budget, which is currently 30 per cent, be dropped to 25 per cent. That was causing a lot of concern within United Nations circles. The World Trade Organisation and GATT are not creatures of the UN, but it is typical of the Americans' new claim to sovereignty that they have said they will enter into the new World Trade Organisation with this caveat: in 12 months time they will revisit the situation to ensure that what they have signed away will not affect their sovereign rights. That is a very important change in an era of change.

         This year sees the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Out of the respect in which it is held by Australians, Richard Butler, the Australian mission head, will share in the celebrations. It appears to me that over those 50 years the UN has extended its activities quite considerably. Where it once had expertise in certain limited areas, it has since expanded its activities and its public service to the point where it is today a kind of jack of all trades and master of none. For example, while it has developed techniques of peacekeeping, its peacekeeping efforts are not coordinated; its peacekeeping does not flow the way it should. While the UN is held to be the authority on peacekeeping, it is not doing all that well in that respect.

         One of the major concerns of the UN—in fact, one of the world's major concerns—is the destructive capability of the landmines that have been sown in their millions throughout warring countries in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. This poses a significant problem because in their collective entirety they could be regarded as a weapon of mass destruction. A question was asked about that this week during question time. It is something that should be given serious consideration because like the plutonium at Maralinga—which is there, which will stay there, and which will be a problem for the next 24,000 years of its half-life—these landmines will be active for many years to come. There is a need for the United Nations, working in consultation with its member nations, to come to an agreement on the supply of these weapons—all Western nations, even though they are members of the United Nations, are guilty in that respect—on the control of their proliferation, and on the way to fix the situation.

         This raises very serious points. This government seems to take great delight in criticising some members of the opposition for the fact that they have received information from people involved with the government and then has turned around and made very gross accusations because those people have actually opened the letters. I have opened this letter because it was addressed to me, just as my colleague the member for Barker opened some mail that was addressed to him. This is the extraordinary thing: he received some mail that was addressed to him and opened it, yet the government turned around and made some great fabrication that, because his mail was addressed to him and he opened it, he should be held in some sort of contempt of this parliament. Even though the government had ensured, through its own mechanisms, that this mail was sent to him and that he should open it, the government feels he should be held responsible for the fact that this was not meant to be directed to him.

There was the mail that they found politically advantageous to them and there is the mail here which is a real embarrassment. It is a very real embarrassment because it was sent to a number of members of the opposition. That it has been sent to me offering me a medal for my service during World War II when I was not even alive shows that the government has made what can only be described as a complete mess—a complete stuff up. Since the minister is now present, he really has to give a very serious explanation as to how he has allowed this to happen and how this is different from the treatment that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has given my colleague.

        Obviously the `to you' should not be in there. This letter has gone out to all members and senators with those two minor mistakes. There is an addendum going out tomorrow.

         We did that for simple reasons. We made a pledge—with the support of the opposition—that we would attempt to do this before Anzac Day, because some of the men and women who will be receiving these medals are in danger of dying before they get their medal. One fellow has cancelled a heart operation so he can turn up at one of these presentation days to get his medal for his long overdue recognition. It is very important to them. That is why we have moved with all haste to get this letter out.

Every member and senator in the relevant states is being invited by my office on the basis that this should be a bipartisan effort in the year of remembrance to recognise the contribution of these diggers.

         salvage operation, which ultimately saved Australians from a multimillion dollar oil spill clean up operation. It was an act of bravery above and beyond their normal duties that saved the coast of Western Australia from an environmental disaster, and one that has been recognised as being worthy of the Star of Courage medal for conspicuous bravery.

         It is also an act of bravery that this government has seen fit to cash in on. This government has actually taxed the money paid to these men as a reward for their bravery. On 28 July 1991 the Greek oil tanker
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Kirki
         </emphasis>
         broke up in heavy seas just 30 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia near Jurien Bay. She carried a cargo of 82,000 tonnes of crude oil. Most members will be aware that this part of the coast has a worldwide significance as a marine conservation area. The area around the Ningaloo Reef has been declared a marine park to protect it.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Flying Clipper

         which would dock alongside her. A constituent of mine from Boyanup, Mr Kevin Hurley, was the man who made that spectacular leap in huge seas—watched by millions of TV viewers—from the

         to be towed out to sea away from the coastline and further damage. The

         was so badly damaged that her cargo of oil was spilling into the ocean. She was on fire and there was every likelihood that the ship would break up and the entire 82,000 tonnes would be washed up on WA beaches.

He would have been quite within his rights to say, `This is too dangerous,' and no-one would have thought less of him. Naturally, when he received his reward of $28,000, Mr Hurley and his young family were delighted. They did not realise that this government would assess the $28,000 reward as income and tax him for it. The government had put its hand out for a share of the reward money. I took this matter up with the Australian Taxation Office on 15 February 1994. The Deputy Commissioner said:

         Mr Hurley is an employee of P&amp;O Maritime Services and the payment of $28,373 is clearly incidental to that employment as it represents remuneration for services rendered on the

        I can assure the Assistant Treasurer and the House that Mr Hurley's response to that decision has been one of total outrage. Constituents have called my office and told me they simply cannot believe any government could stoop so low as to actually tax a man's bravery.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The message this sends out from the government is quite plain. If you carry out some brave, courageous deed for the benefit of your fellow Australians, you can expect to be taxed on any reward money. Clearly, this government places a different value on these actions. This government treats income as income—even if it is a reward for conspicuous bravery. It also puts into question the actions of our police officers, firemen and emergency services personnel, whose actions go above and beyond their normal duties.

         The Assistant Treasurer has said in regard to this case that there is no discretion to waive the tax assessed. Clearly, there is only one sensible course of action open to the government—to change the system so that the Assistant Treasurer can, at his discretion, waive the tax assessed. No-one is paid as part of his or her normal employment for acts of extreme bravery. Mr Hurley might well have said, `My life is more important than the marine environment.' But he did not, and we should all be grateful to him. We should praise his actions and encourage others to put their fellow Australians first. We should not slap a tax on their bravery.

         a letter to the editor from Mr Robert Smith QC. The letter needs to be taken with the knowledge of Mr Robert Smith's background and his close past association with Mr McKechnie.

         Mr Robert Smith suggests in his letter that I should have gone to the official corruption commission and let it handle this matter. That of course is, as Mr Robert Smith QC knows, an absolute joke. Mr John Porter sits on the official corruption commission. Had I gone there, my complaint simply would have been handed back to CIB, which would put it right back in the hands of Mr Les Ayton. Mr Ayton would have then called in Mr Trevor Porter, the son of John Porter—whom he called, I might add, to investigate claims by policemen that they were harassed over Mr McKechnie's recent actions.

         You have here a closed loop which is impossible to break. Rather than attacking its independence, I propose to protect the independence of the DPP. To do this, it is quite simple. All one has to do is implement the policies that have been put in place by Mr Kennett in Victoria. I think that people on both sides of this House would agree that Mr Kennett is hardly a radical.

         Mr Kennett has put in a regime where, if he believes there is not significant evidence for the defence counsel, he sends his brief to an independent committee comprising two independent QCs and the Solicitor-General. They look at the evidence—they do not communicate with the lawyer at all—and go straight to the prosecutor and say, `On investigation, we don't think you have the evidence here to prosecute. We're not saying you can't prosecute, but if you prosecute be aware that it's against our advice and the cost to the states will be on your head.' I would go one further and say that where a prosecutor takes prosecutions, as Mr McKechnie has, where people are put to great expense and, although they have eventually won, have been finally ruined the states should be liable for those costs.

          The tourism industry in Australia is a young industry. It is in its early growth stages. That industry has the potential to provide a great deal of income to the Commonwealth of Australia in the future. I commend the report. However, I also commend the recommendation at the end of the dissenting report from the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite).

          The honourable member recommends that a comprehensive review of the indirect taxation arrangements should be undertaken to develop options for reform which address the need for simplicity, equity and efficiency. It is important that we note that recommendation in the dissenting report.

          We all know—and the government should know—that the indirect taxes levied in this country are an impediment, not only to the tourism industry, but also to a lot of other small businesses and manufacturing industries. If we are serious about helping those industries grow and about helping the development of greater employment prospects for the nearly one million people who are unemployed in Australia today, we need to pay attention to that area.

          There are some good recommendations in the report. For example, recommendation No. 3 says that all vehicles which are used exclusively for earning assessable income should be fully depreciable. That is a commonsense recommendation. All the recommendations in the report, as far as I can see, are aimed at assisting the industry to get up and get going, thus generating more income for the country and generating more employment.

          Another recommendation which I highlight is recommendation No. 5. It says that net capital gains tax should be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. No doubt government members would be aware that that was part of our policy at the 1993 election. That ties in with part of the recommendation of the honourable member for Dawson in his dissenting report about providing fairness and equity, and incentives to continue to invest in Australia. It is a very important recommendation. I urge the government to take it on board.

          The next recommendation I had highlighted—and it goes to the heart of a bit of a problem that I have had with a couple of tourism operators in my electorate of Lyne—is recommendation No. 11, that:

        <para>
         This is a terribly important recommendation and one that should be flagged to the government and indeed to the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to act upon. The lack of exemption is causing a great deal of hardship in the tourism sector in Australia.

          Over the last couple of years—and indeed prior to the incumbent minister taking on the portfolio—ecotourism has been promoted and developed at a very rapid rate in all parts of Australia but in particular on the eastern seaboard. It is one element of growth that we are creating, a little bit of a niche market, in my region of New South Wales. We have the advantage of being close to the coast, close to the beaches, as well as having operators such as those that I am talking about who are providing day trips or overnight trips to the hinterland, into our forests, into our national parks, using these exact vehicles.

          These operators cannot get sales tax exemption unless they pay a hell of a large price for a vehicle that seats more than 12 people. Those vehicles that seat more than 12 people are not suitable for the type of job that they are doing. A couple of such operators are Richard Morocco from Port Macquarie, who had a vehicle specially built because he needed to have it under that size to operate in the forestry areas and the steep country that he goes into, and Wayne Whitford in Wingham, who is in the same predicament as he attempts to become established in the market.

         to allow for competition between government run transport services and those operated privately. Sales tax is imposed on vehicles of 12 seats or under, even when these vehicles are used entirely for commercial purposes.

         It is the four-wheel drive vehicles that I am talking about. The next paragraph states:

         Ideally we would have liked an 8-10 seater 4WD but found that to have any less than 13 seats we would have to pay 21% sales tax. For example, a specially made 4WD coach built by Noosa Coach and Body would cost $121 000 with 8-10 seats and only $100 000 with 13 seats!

        <para>
         Therefore, the committee came up with its very simple recommendation on exemption. In all areas of Australia these vehicles need to be specially licensed. In New South Wales people have to be specially licensed by the Roads and Traffic Authority as tourism operators and tourist bus operators. That licence should surely be the criterion for the provision of exemption from that 21 per cent sales tax, which is an added burden in establishing these businesses.

          The government keeps telling us that it is all about helping small business get established. We are pouring lots of public dollars into that section of our community trying to get small businesses going through such schemes as the NEAT program, yet we are hitting people who are trying to start up a small business in the ecotourism area with a 21 per cent sales tax on their major item of capital expenditure. It is ridiculous, so I urge the government to take on board that recommendation in the report.

         I think that is probably code for telling the government that in the 9 May budget there should be no bed tax. But the report does not come out clearly and say that, I suppose because the government members on the committee could not be so forthright as to come out and say, `No bed tax.'

          The prospect of a bed tax and the public discussion that has taken place with regard to the implementation of a bed tax in Australia in the budget in May have caused a great deal of heartburn and concern in the accommodation and tourism industries. It goes right to the heart of whether the government is really serious about developing an industry such as the tourism industry and assisting the accommodation industry to stay afloat and stay viable.

          These industries have been belted around the ears over the last number of years since 1986-87, when the government introduced the FBT. When it was introduced, the FBT collected $535 million. In 1994-95 the FBT is expected to raise $3.23 billion—$3,230,000,000. This represents an increase of 500 per cent in nine years, and that is coming out of the productive sectors of Australia. You can argue all you like about the equity of an FBT; we believe that it should be completely reviewed. We believe that there should be a tax on non-cash remuneration, but it has gone miles too far. It has absolutely gone miles too far. There is no question that it has cost jobs in this country.

         That is absolutely correct. But the report still does not dispel the possibility of this government introducing a bed tax in the budget in May.

          There has been plenty of debate about it and, if the government does go down that path, it will surely reap another backlash like it did in the Canberra by-election from that section of the community.

We want to keep it that way.

          I would like to urge the government again, as has been done on numerous occasions by members from this side of the House, not to consider a bed tax. It would be a very regressive tax. I also urge the government when dealing with this report to seriously consider recommendation No. 11, that a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and four-wheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under and that the Transport Ministers Council be consulted for its assistance with the implementation of this exemption. It is a very important recommendation for the continued development of this important industry throughout Australia. I certainly hope that the minister is a little bit quicker in dealing with this report than some of his colleagues have been in dealing with a number of other reports.

          In closing, I must say that a report that is very important to the tourism industry in Australia and, certainly, in my electorate is the Industry Commission's report on the petroleum industry, which the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has had for in excess of six months now and has not responded to. We think he has put it in the too-hard basket. It is one for which a lot of people throughout Australia, particularly in the tourism industry, are screaming out for a positive and constructive response from the government. I just hope that, when the Minister for Tourism is getting ready to respond to this report, he does it in a speedier fashion than that in which the Assistant Treasurer has dealt with the report from the Industry Commission on the petroleum industry.

During that time, seven non-claimant applications have been determined, yet in not one case has native title been declared. That has come as a tremendous blow to Aboriginal people, whose expectations were raised very much by the Native Title Act and the rhetoric that went with it. They had expectations of the awarding of native title over sections of unclaimed crown land. Yet, to date, after well over a year, there has actually been no determination in favour of Aboriginal people.

          In fact, the only determinations that have been made—seven in all—have been made in favour of non-claimants. In that situation, we might feel that perhaps it is because of the backlog of 100 or so applications in the system and that, when they go through, we may see some positive determinations on behalf of Aboriginal people. But, when we turn to the actual annual report, which this report is examining, we find this phrase by Justice French, and I think it is one that should disturb everybody. On page 3 of the annual report, Justice French says:

         It is too early at this stage to say that the Tribunal will succeed in its objective of finding resolutions to many or any of the claims lodged with it during the reporting period.
        </para>
        <para>
         Although that, at the first glance, seems to be a fairly benign statement, when one actually looks at what it means, Mr Justice French is saying that he is not optimistic that any of the claims before him will reach a resolution in favour of native title. That is very sobering and an absolute blow, as I certainly know, to the aspirations of Aboriginal people on the basis of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others have said on the advent of the Native Title Act.

          As to the hundred or so applications that are still in the pipeline, we have to expect that at least another hundred will come up this year. If, in that period there have only been seven determinations, and there are a hundred applications outstanding and an estimate of a hundred more to come up this year, there will be an enormous backlog sitting there, waiting. We will understand the difficulties in resolving those determinations if we look at the claim around Kununurra, where there are over 220 claimants and non-claimants who have to go through the mediation process. It would be a nightmare to try to mediate amongst 220 different claimants and non-claimants. The record shows that there is little hope for Aboriginal people in regard to native title and that the hopes that they did have are not being met.

          On other matters, although the process is moving slowly, the tribunal reports that it is happy with the way that it is  running. As to the tribunal's threshold in regard to the claims process, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title found that the process is consistent with the Native Title Act. It was found that the threshold was at about the right level, that the claims are not automatically accepted, and that there has to be a clear case for those claims to be put on the agenda. The threshold is high enough to stop hopeless cases from being accepted and bogging down the tribunal's process, but also low enough to enable many claims to reach the mediation stage.

         The committee considers that this is a reasonable recommendation and would support such an amendment to the act.

That validity has now been determined and we would expect that Justice French will bring forward further suggested amendments to the act.

          —I also wish to comment on the second report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title. The report is a relatively short one and it deals with the so-called annual report for 1993-94 of the National Native Title Tribunal. In fact, that annual report was not an annual report at all, because the tribunal was only established on 1 January 1994. It is really a report on six months of operation and even that six months of operation has to be seen in its proper context. From 1 January until 2 May there was only an interim president: the president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the acting president of the native title tribunal. Until even beyond the reporting date, 30 June 1994, there was no registrar; there was only an acting registrar, who, again, was the registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

          As Justice French took office as president on 2 May, the report deals only with a period of about two months during which he was in office. The report was delivered in September; it is now relatively out of date in terms of the history of that body.

          Almost as soon as he took over, it became readily apparent to the president that there were difficulties under the legislation that needed addressing. These were picked up in the submissions made to the parliamentary joint committee, which has a statutory obligation to consider and report on the Native Title Tribunal annual reports. The committee invited submissions, took viva voce evidence and has prepared a written report.

          In that report the committee highlights two difficulties that arise in relation to the legislation. It is to be borne in mind, in considering those matters, that the tribunal does not deal with or determine in any finite way any application for native title which is opposed or, for that matter, any application by a non-claimant which is opposed.

          The principal functions of the tribunal are to act as a registry for claims—that involves a formal acceptance procedure—and then to act as mediator in relation to opposed claims. The first difficulty highlighted in the report is in relation to the actual acceptance of applications. In the first instance, under section 63 of the Native Title Act, the application is dealt with by the registrar. The registrar must accept it, unless he or she is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out. The provision relating to the prima facie status of the claim is in section 63(1)(b) of the act.

          If the registrar is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out, it is then referred to a presidential member. However, the presidential member does not apply the same test. The presidential member is directed by the legislation to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out, so that, instead of the negative ruling that a prima facie claim could not be made out on the face of it, the presidential member proceeds to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out. That is a cause for confusion on the part of those involved in applications.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second issue dealt with by the committee relates to events after acceptance. If an application is unopposed, then, under section 70 of the act the tribunal may make a determination along the lines sought by the applicant, if it is satisfied that the applicant has made out a prima facie case for a determination in those terms. In addition, it must be determined that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances. If the application is opposed, it then goes to mediation.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Before making a determination that the tribunal is satisfied as to the prima facie case, the tribunal must hold an inquiry. However, with regard to opposed applications it has no power to hold an inquiry before mediation. So it may be obliged to conduct mediation in relation to an application for which no prima facie case could be made out if the matter were examined. The president has proposed an amendment to the parliamentary joint committee that would rectify the difficulties arising in that situation.

          Events have moved since 30 June 1994. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) pointed out, there has been no finding of native title in any case.

          At the time of the debate in the parliament concerning the Native Title Bill at the end of 1993, many speakers warned of the possible unworkability of the procedures that were set out in the act. They also warned the government that the time that the government anticipated it would take for the completion of applications for native title to be heard by the Federal Court and finally determined would be much longer than the government anticipated. That seems to have been borne out. We do not know how long it is going to take because as yet no claim has been completed.

          The principal event to occur since 30 June 1994 to which I want to draw attention is that Justice French has progressed in his understanding of the procedures under the act and has developed his thinking in relation to some of the problems that have arisen with the legislation. On 14 March 1995 he issued a discussion paper entitled
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Discussion paper on proposed changes to Native Title Act 1993
          </emphasis>

          Justice French has made a proposal which can only be regarded as fundamental in relation to the role of the tribunal. He has identified that there are significant tensions between the role of the tribunal as a decision maker, where it appears to be exercising judicial or quasi-judicial power on the one hand, and the role of the tribunal as mediator on the other hand, where it is seeking to have the parties come to an agreement rather than determining for parties what the rights and obligations are.

        <para first-indent="16">

          In commenting on that tension, His Honour has pointed out that the designation of the tribunal as a tribunal and the involvement of serving judges gives rise to a belief that the tribunal is a species of court which can deliver binding and conclusive decisions about the existence of native title. That is not the case at all. He says that those two matters adulterate the tribunal's role as a mediator. He points out that the role of the tribunal as a decision maker gives rise to second order litigation in relation to tribunal decisions.

        <para first-indent="16">

          What he is pointing out there is that, although the Native Title Act contemplates that the tribunal will act as a registry and as a mediator and that decisions will be made in relation to native title claims by the Federal Court, the role of the tribunal is itself subject to second order litigation in the form of judicial review of its decisions in relation to its role as a registrar and its role as a mediator.

          He also draws attention in this paper to difficulties that arise out of the decision of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In that case the High Court held that the commission was purporting to exercise judicial power in breach of section 71 of the constitution in seeking to make enforcable determinations after hearings.

          This gives rise to questions as to whether the Native Title Tribunal also is acting in breach of the constitution in relation to some of the decisions which are committed to it. The judge also points out that the tribunal has the unenviable task perhaps of being seen only as a place where native title claims will fail, since it has no role in relation to the finding of native title, unless there is no opposition. The usual course of events for an application before the tribunal will be that it will fail because any application that survives the prima facie claim test, in the face of opposition and in the absence of any successful mediation, will be referred to the Federal Court.

          The issues that are raised by Justice French in his discussion paper are very important and very serious and warrant the urgent attention of the government. Justice French sets out a process which he believes would single out the Native Title Tribunal as a mediator and eliminate the confusion of its role in relation to native title applications where it has power to make decisions. In effect, his procedure would be a court based one in which the tribunal would not act as the registry but would simply act as a mediation service. He recommends that serving judges not be involved.

          On the face of it, what he proposes appears to me to have considerable merit. Any confusion of judicial roles on the one hand with administrative roles on the other hand is something that ought to be avoided not only because it is in breach of the constitution but also because when a body that is committed to making judicial determinations has other roles the parties perceive it in a different way. They do not necessarily accept that it is a body which is committed to making determinations after a contested hearing. They see it as a body which is also involved in, in this case, mediation. In other cases, it may be conciliation or arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution mode. But it is important, I think, that public confidence in bodies which make judicial decisions be preserved to the utmost extent, and that involves keeping those bodies involved only in judicial decision making. I commend the discussion paper to the consideration of the government.

        (a) &amp; (d) The Department of Human Services and Health has given active consideration to the development of a private health insurance complaints unit. As part of the Government's proposed private health insurance reforms, amendments to the National Health Act 1953 provide for the establishment of a Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner. The Commissioner's functions are intended to include answering enquiries, making recommendations and conciliating in complaints made by health insurance contributors, hospitals, private health insurance funds, doctors and the Minister, on issues such as a non-payment of claims, misleading information about health insurance products and poor service from health insurance funds.

        Whichever source the palliative care funding comes from (either under the Medicare Agreements or "new" money arising from the Election commitment), it is the responsibility of the States/ Territories to allocate it within their jurisdictions. There is no direct Commonwealth funding of patients in private hospitals (or public hospitals). Under the Program, there is an emphasis on expansion or enhancement of networks of community based care as opposed to institution oriented services. However, institutions do receive funding to maintain ongoing services. Patients who have been treated in either private or public hospitals have access to services funded under the Program.
