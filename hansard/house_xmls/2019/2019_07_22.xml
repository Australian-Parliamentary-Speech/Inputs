                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is utter madness to use public funds to prop up coal-fired power stations or even build new ones, but that's what this government wants to do, and this parliament must stop them. This bill is as environmentally responsible as it is economically responsible. The bill will help Australia cut its greenhouse gas emissions, which we need to do in the middle of a climate emergency, by preventing the Commonwealth from actively assisting in the construction of new coal-fired power stations, extending the life of existing coal-fired power stations, helping purchase new coal-fired power stations or assisting the owner of a coal-fired power station to use, fund or operate the station.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also protect the Commonwealth and the Australian taxpayer from unnecessary exposure to the significant financial risk associated with providing financial support to potentially stranded assets. It also protects from exposure associated with underwriting the carbon risk of new coal-fired power generation, something previous ministers have flagged, which may be significant if a future government takes steps needed to limit Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the activities and priorities of this government and the movement that is building outside of this place is truly remarkable. As people in Australia and all around the world gather together to recognise and demand action on the climate emergency, our elected government ignores it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our movement demands rapid reduction in pollution, they're rising under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our movement demands that coal is kept in the ground, this government wants to dig it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our movement demands that we stop Adani, this government starts it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our movement demands action, there's inertia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Greens will not be complicit in these crimes. We will not permit this reckless government to get away with destroying our future. We will try and save them from themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because 50 or 100 years from now, when future generations learn about what happened in the early 2000's, they will wonder why the people in power ignored the unavoidable truth of the climate emergency. Because right now we are witnessing the condemned. We are bearing witness to those who are in power, who will soon be usurped because they broke their duty of care to act, and act swiftly. I am standing here and I am looking at the people who tried to keep things the same in the face of incontrovertible danger. I condemn them now, as they will be condemned in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They will be condemned for rushing to hand over taxpayer money to ageing coal-fired power stations or, worse, funding a new coal-fired power plant. They will be condemned for trying to open new coal and gas basins that are giant carbon bombs, even when we know that to limit global warming to 1½ degrees, we can't have any new fossil fuel developments. They will be condemned for propping up the fossil fuel cartels that are destroying this planet. And they will be condemned for not enabling and accelerating the transformation that they are desperately trying to foil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the science and the economics of the transition are not in favour of the climate deniers. The power of renewable energy and 21st century technology is blasting 20th and 19th century technology out of the water. But my warning to the movement and to the millions of people in Australia and around the world who are pushing for change, is the change may not be inevitable if this government and governments like it stand in the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this bill is so important is that the government is led by a Prime Minister who hugged a piece of coal in this chamber and is looking to deploy the vast resources and power of government to protect and encourage fossil fuels, at significant risk to the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made its intentions clear: that it is looking to use public money to underwrite investment in new generation and that this generation could include coal and gas and oil. As I said last year, when introducing this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any new coal-fired plant or a plant with an extended life risks being a stranded asset with the taxpayers losing our contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the risk to the taxpayer doesn't end there. The government has also flagged the possibility of indemnifying coal plants from a future carbon price or from other policies to limit emissions brought in by a future government. This potentially open-ended liability for taxpayers is an irresponsible concoction from the coal-power-obsessed minority in the coalition that tore down a previous Prime Minister and now wants to booby trap climate and energy policy for future governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent report from the world scientists from the IPCC says very clearly that the world must retire at least two-thirds of its coal-fired power plants in just over a decade by 2030. By 2030 we have to shut at least two-thirds of the coal-fired power plants in Australia to have a decent chance of staying below 1½ degrees, and we have to close the rest soon after. That's what the scientists told us last year. They warned that, unless we accelerate the transition away from coal, we face catastrophe. But this government shows no signs of behaving responsibly, and, if the government is not prepared to behave responsibly, then this parliament must make it do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to the government is that, if you do not act, you will be taken on by one of the biggest movements this world has ever seen. We know this from the school strikes for climate, where over a million students in over 2,000 cities rallied this year. And we know that on September this year there will be even more people, students and adults, pouring into the streets around the world to demand action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am confident that the paralysis that is gripping governments all over the world will be broken through the sheer force of the will of millions of people demanding action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Greens will play our part in parliament, which brings me back to what this bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, a primary aim of the bill is to assist in the reduction of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by preventing the Commonwealth from actively assisting in the construction of new coal-fired power stations, extending the life of existing coal-fired power stations or helping purchase new coal-fired power stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also protect the Commonwealth and the Australian taxpayer from unnecessary exposure to the significant financial risk associated with providing financial support to potentially stranded assets. It also protects from exposure associated with what the government has flagged, which is underwriting the carbon risk of new coal-fired power generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon commencement of this bill, the Commonwealth must not provide financial assistance for the building of, refurbishment of or purchase of coal-fired power stations. And this includes the provision of indirect assistance, such as through the underwriting or guarantee of someone else's financial obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exemptions are provided to permit the Commonwealth to exercise its usual regulatory processes, to provide support to workers and communities affected by power station closures, to fund research related to coal-fired power stations generally or to manage the closure of coal-fired power stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is distressing that in 2019 we have to introduce a bill to try and stop a trigger-happy government from using public funds against the best interests of the public. But this is truly a piece of legislation that is desperately needed and it says a lot about how dire the situation has become in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week was the five-year anniversary of the carbon price repeal. People will remember when members of the government hugged and celebrated the repeal of the only mechanism in Australia's history that has successfully brought down pollution, and since then pollution has gone up and up and up. There is an infamous image of five Liberal politicians in this chamber, some retired and some current, celebrating the moment that Australia became the first country in the world to repeal a price on pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, as they celebrated, a country mourned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pollution is going up at the same time as you're proposing to cut it. When you take out the unreliable land use data, pollution has gone up six per cent under this government that says it's committed to cutting it. Well, pollution is going up and up and up. The parliament does not want that; the public does not want that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, though, the real legacy of this government on global warming is increasing pollution. And we are no longer leading the world with action on climate change—something that Labor, the Greens and the Independents did when working together—because it was torn down by this government and their fossil fuel donors. We need to take some steps to save this government from themselves, to save them from exposing the taxpayer, and pass this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community wants to provide protection to the Great Australian Bight. We know that our environment and our livelihoods depend upon a clean ocean. A commitment to decent and enduring protection for the Great Australian Bight continues to be a vexed issue for both of our country's major political parties. I would potentially say that it would have something to do with donations received, but I digress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community of Mayo and the coastal communities across South Australia and beyond want to see urgent protection from the serious environmental, economic and social impacts that could occur as a result of risky, deep-sea oil drilling in the bight, and we've said it for years. We've been very loud. We've been very clear. We have had paddle outs for the bight and we have had Hands Across the Sand, but the government is not listening. Sadly, during the recent election, we did not have any movement from the opposition on this critical issue for my community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I welcome the election commitment by the government to undertake a thorough audit of the regulation of offshore oil exploration in the bight, this is simply not enough. I recognise that the chance of an oil spill is projected to be small; however, there is still a chance. Any impact of spill would be catastrophic, and we simply cannot risk it. My community relies very heavily on a recreational fishing industry and a commercial fishing industry, and every business, every B &amp; B and every fish and chip shop along the coastline rely heavily on a beautiful, pristine ocean environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My preference and that of my community is to see risky deep-sea oil drilling in the bight simply banned. However, I recognise that the major parties are on a long journey to properly represent the views of our coastal communities on the issue. The reintroduction of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Heritage Listing for the Bight) Bill 2019 represents a reasonable compromise as a first step towards fully and properly protecting South Australia's coastal community, jobs and environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community, on the whole, is genuinely deeply concerned that the Norwegian government majority owned company Equinor is continuing to pursue this in our community. We believe that there is a better future for our coastal regions and we believe that that risk should be reduced. National heritage listing would provide a layer of protection that would bolster community confidence that the most rigorous standards of protections are being adopted and adhered to. I therefore commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been over a year since the damning <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> footage was first aired in April 2018 and we learnt that over 2,400 sheep had died with many more suffering severe distress in terrible conditions. The images showed but a snapshot of the horror that the sheep endured on their voyage on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. And to this day, I still receive countless emails from members of my community, including those on the land, who are deeply concerned about this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it's now been over a year since the member for Farrer, now Minister for the Environment, introduced her private member's bill in May 2018. I must say, as a person sitting around in her office, it felt to me like a glimmer of hope, although that glimmer of hope certainly did fade when the bill did not progress any further. And, when the member brought it in, I think many of us in this chamber had great hope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But for one minor amendment, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bills 2019 I am introducing today mirrors the member for Farrer's original proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Namely, this bill introduces provisions which will restrict long-haul export of life sheep and lambs during the northern summer months of June, July, August and September during a five-year transitional period or at any time after the period where the voyage meets the following three criteria: firstly, that the voyage is by ship, secondly, that the voyage exceeds 10 days in duration, and thirdly, where a place in that voyage, regardless of the final destination, is either the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only difference between the bill introduced by the member for Farrer in the previous parliament and the one introduced in the House today is an expansion of the restriction during the northern summer months from three to four months, such that the period that is now prohibited is June to September, where previously it was July to September.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion brings the bill into alignment with the government's own temporary ban on long-haul live sheep exports during June, July and August and those foreshadowed in the regulatory options paper released by the department earlier this month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ban was introduced by the department earlier this year following the damning findings of both the government initiated McCarthy review and its own independent technical committee appointed to review the heat stress modelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McCarthy review found major failures within the industry's heat stress risk assessment model and recommended a change away from pure mortality rates to one based on animal welfare indicators—a novel idea, for an industry that, in the words of the member for Farrer, uses 'an operating model built on animal suffering'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But rather than adopt a measured and sensible phasing out of this industry, then and there, the government instead pursues another review and appoints a technical committee to determine the appropriate level of suffering that sheep may endure during long-haul live export voyages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department's technical committee released their draft report in December 2018 and it made for sobering reading. In short, all vessels entering the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea from May to October may exceed the heat stress thresholds of almost all classes of sheep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on the findings from the draft report, the technical committee released a regulatory options paper to determine the best way forward, including a proposed prohibition on trading in September.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the paper proposed three options in response to the draft heat stress review report that was released in December 2018, the first option—being an expansion on the long-haul live sheep exports into the month of September—is the only option that is consistent with its own scientific data and expert advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I have before the House is consistent with option 1 of the regulatory options paper and would see a prohibition on exports during the summer months of June, July, August and September.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, it would see the welfare of animals placed above the profits of exporters. However, I accept that my bill is not for everyone, and the bill I introduce today, like the bills previously introduced by the member for Farrer, is a compromise bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It cannot be the perfect bill for everyone who has a view on this issue, but it is a good bill and provides a working compromise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may say that five years does not provide primary producers enough time to adapt to changing regulatory environment. But this bill should not be viewed in this way. It is an opportunity to assist an industry that is already in terminal decline—and I think it's important to make that statement—to transition away from long-haul live sheep exports and create Australian code abattoirs and employ local workers in much-needed production jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know in my community we desperately want more local abattoirs, and I am working very closely with industry and local government in my community to see what the potential could be. And no doubt there are electorates in Western Australia who are calling for the same support. These are well-paid, good local jobs, and we want those local jobs in our regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must act now to ensure the welfare of Australian livestock and to protect Australia's reputation, which is critical, as a nation that supports responsible and humane agricultural practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my hope, one that is shared by thousands of my constituents, who write, call and email me, that the member for Farrer's original bill—which she showed great courage in presenting to this House—finally passes this chamber, ending this long-running saga, and that we have a better future for live sheep. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I also reintroduce the Banking Amendment (Rural Finance Reform) Bill, or, as I like to call it, banking protection for mum-and-dad farmers. I've spoken in detail on this bill on previous occasions and so I will only briefly summarise its content and intent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be talking again this week about the terrible impact that drought has had on our landowners.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All too often farmers are forced into debt and despair during droughts and hard times. We know all too well the scourge of anxiety, depression and suicide in rural communities that accompanies a drought.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to address the power imbalance between family farmers and banks, relating to loans under $5 million. It seeks to do this prudently and even-handedly and without undermining the incentives for rural lenders to supply credit to agricultural communities. But it also seeks to restore trust and integrity to the financial relationships between lender and farmer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we saw in the banking royal commission, in regional areas many farmers were treated absolutely terribly by the banks—I would say, in many respects, even more so than those who were seeking funding from the banks in metropolitan areas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 45th Parliament, this bill was successfully referred to the Standing Committee on Economics, and I thank that committee, and in particular the member for Goldstein, who is in the chamber today, for their interest in this issue. As the inquiry lapsed with the dissolution of this House, I will be seeking to re-refer this bill to that committee, and I thank those members in advance for their support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance is all about transparency in government and public policy and we believe that mandating the publication of staffing ratios in aged-care facilities will empower our community to make informed choices. There is a great deal of fear associated with ageing, and we need to take steps to provide families and residents with peace of mind. This bill will also create a more competitive market where residential aged-care services can more easily attract people through their greater quality of service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers are entering residential aged care much later in life and with much more complex health needs. In February this year, the royal commission into aged care heard evidence that, in 2008-2009, only 12.7 per cent of the residential aged care population were classified as high needs. Ten years later, it sits at 53 per cent. The aged-care providers must ensure that we have the right mix of appropriately trained staff to provide the necessary level of care to our vulnerable older Australians. More importantly, the government must take steps to ensure that this information is freely available to all potential consumers to consider as part of their decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public's increasing desire for transparency around staffing levels is understandable. Whilst acknowledging that not all aged-care providers are the same, much of the evidence provided to the royal commission into aged care is deeply troubling, and any efforts to improve accountability and transparency should be embraced by this parliament as a measured and reasonable step in the right direction. That is what my bill, the Aged Care Amendment (Staffing Ratio Disclosure) Bill, is; it's a first step in the right direction. The bill requires the quarterly disclosure of staffing ratios by each residential care facility, which would be aggregated and published by the government. In their disclosure publication, staffing ratios are broken down by staffing category—namely by registered nurses, enrolled nurses, personal care attendants, allied health staff and other staff members. If between reporting dates any of these ratios change by more than 10 per cent, the aged-care provider must also notify the government within 28 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that different facilities have a different composition of residents with a differing profile of needs. As such, the aged-care provider may accompany their staffing ratio disclosure with a short written explanation. This written explanation from the aged-care facility could provide the context of why they have a particular staffing ratio and therefore would provide even greater clarity to the general public. The aim of this bill is not to introduce mandatory minimum staffing ratios; it is to provide the public with another piece of information to consider when making what is often a challenging choice in distressing circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of giving evidence at the royal commission in February 2019, Ms Pat Sparrow, CEO of Aged &amp; Community Services Australia—the national peak body that provides support for the not-for-profit, church, charitable and full-purpose aged-care providers—was asked to comment on mandatory minimum staffing ratios.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill went through the formal committee process.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was broad support for the bill, with the committee ultimately recommending that the bill be passed in its then present form. However, the committee did note that it would be beneficial for consumers to have the confidence that they were comparing apples with apples.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be done by breaking down providers according to their average Aged Care Funding Instrument category. The Aged Care Funding Instrument, or ACFI, is a tool used by the department to determine the level of resources required by each residential care service provider to meet the care needs of the aged-care recipients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It focuses on the main areas that discriminate care needs among residents. When completed on all residents in the facility, the ACFI identifies the overall relative care needs profile and the subsequent funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Categorising residential aged-care providers into ACFI quartiles will better enable consumers and their families to compare facilities with similar levels of resident acuity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also aware that some smaller providers, especially those in regional locations, voiced concerns about the administrative burden in the quarterly publication of ratios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do not accept that the measures contained in my bill create an unreasonable burden, noting that the information is likely already collected by providers in any event, I have included a legislative review in the bill to specifically consider the administrative impacts on providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review will be undertaken following 12 months of operation and will also consider whether more detailed information should also be disclosed by providers, including the difference in staffing numbers for day shifts versus night shifts and weekday versus weekend shifts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But even without the amendments included in the bill before the House today, I want to emphasise that the committee still recommended that the bill be passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are steps that this government can take now to improve the experience of residents and support aged-care workers without waiting for the final recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one of those steps. This bill does not introduce mandatory minimum staffing. The bill does not set a required ratio for aged-care providers. It is a measure to improve transparency and accountability in a sector that has frankly struggled to meet the expectations of vulnerable older Australians and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I wish to share a quote from the submission of Ms Michelle Willems, one of several individuals who made a submission to the committee inquiry into the earlier version of the bill. Ms Willems shared her own experiences with the aged-care sector. In her words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have witnessed the very worst of human behaviour towards those most vulnerable. I do not believe that this parlous behaviour can all be simply attributed to staff cuts/numbers, but I do believe that the Bill is absolutely necessary and should be mandated with haste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill had the support of the committee, it had the support of consumers and it had the support of the previous Minister for Ageing and Senior Australians. I'm now calling on the Morrison government to implement the measures contained in my amended bill. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I would like to thank the staff who work in aged-care facilities across my electorate from Restvale in Lobethal to Sandpiper Lodge in Goolwa. I know that the vast majority of staff, from registered nurses to catering staff—and I might also include all of the wonderful volunteers—are passionate about what they do and they care deeply for the welfare of their residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill highlights the valuable role that aged-care workers play in our communities. Those that staff our aged-care facilities carry out incredibly important work, with high levels of responsibility, requiring a unique mix of both technical skill and compassion and understanding. It is also a position of great power, with workers responsible for almost every aspect of their residents' day-to-day lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 Australian Law Reform Commission's report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Elder a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">buse—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">a national legal r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">esponse</span>, highlights that it is our workforce that is the first line of defence against elder abuse, and that a professionally trained, qualified and dedicated workforce will respect and advance the rights of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, however, there are those who do not have the right set of skills or attributes to work with our vulnerable older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the majority of aged-care workers carry out their duties in a safe, competent and ethical manner. However there is a small proportion who present a serious risk to aged-care consumers because they are incompetent or impaired, or engage in exploitative, predatory or illegal conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Amendment (Worker Screening Database) Bill 2019 amends the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act to establish a database for nationally consistent worker screening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements recommendation 4.9 of the 2017 Australian Law Reform Commission report into elder abuse, and seeks to minimise the risk of harm to older Australians from those who work closely with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will require all workers and volunteers in the aged-care sector to undergo a screening process with their details then registered on a national database operated by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is an appropriate independent body and will provide greater consistency in decision-making as to whether a person should be cleared to work with vulnerable consumers of aged-care services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The database will enable employers, and potential employers, to search the database to screen potential employees for any history of misconduct.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Information entered into the database will include involvement in any reportable incidents under the existing compulsory reporting scheme and any disciplinary proceedings and complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to include information beyond merely a criminal history, noting that a guilty finding in criminal proceedings requires a very high evidentiary burden. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme intends to also capture conduct that meets a lower threshold to enable a more comprehensive risk assessment of a person's suitability to work in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entries on the database will be real-time information and should serve as a 'red flag' for potential employers. The database is not a determinative indicator of a person's skills, aptitude or suitability for employment in the aged-care sector but it does give potential employers another tool at their disposal to assess the potential risk posed by an applicant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The successful implementation of the scheme will require the states and territories to also enact laws regarding screening and the sharing of necessary information, similar to the Intergovernmental Agreement on Nationally Consistent Worker Screening under the proposed National Disability Insurance Scheme national worker screening database.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the NDIS national screening database bill is currently before the parliament. I welcome the introduction of this legislation and hope to see it implemented without delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their report on elder abuse, the ALRC predicted what has already been witnessed by many aged care providers, being the sharing of the disability and aged care workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend I again took part—with the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the member for Lyne—in the Pollie Pedal bike ride for Soldier On. I rode from Kin Kin to Brisbane and stopped overnight at the Caloundra RSL in my electorate of Fisher, where we met with veterans at a special reception where we heard Daniel Keighran VC talk about his experiences in Afghanistan and how he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The ride, as I said, what was in support of Soldier On, which is a fantastic charity that is working to support service men and women both past and present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Fisher, I also have also instigated, with the support of Australia Zoo and our local RSLs, a Sunshine Coast veterans' day to add to the traditional ways that we recognise our veterans' service. On this day, during Veterans' Health Week, past and present ADF personnel and their partners receive free entry into the zoo. They enjoy their world-class animal experiences and spend some time with other former service men and women at events throughout the day organised by Mates4Mates, among others. It is just another of the many ways that my community pay their respects to the service men and women of the Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it so important that we as a nation do as much as we can to support and honour our service men and women both past and present? It is because those men and women make such a huge contribution to our nation, often at a high cost to themselves and to their families that they leave behind. I pay tribute to those members of this parliament who have served our ADF in uniform. They give us so much, and they deserve our gratitude and support in return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the ADF Parliamentary Program I've been fortunate to see the men and women of our armed forces at work. I strongly encourage new members to avail themselves of that fantastic program. I visited the Middle East region and spent time with troops who've been deployed on Operation Okra and Operation Highroad. I've travelled with HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> and visited HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cerberus</span>. Recently I spent time on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Melville</span> off Fitzroy Island, where I met with two young Navy personnel: Executive Officer Sara Barnett and Midshipman Darby Langton. I was pleased to learn that Sara went to Maleny State High School, which is in my electorate, and Darby attended Beerwah State High School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have seen has left me with absolutely no doubt of the massive contribution that the men and women of the ADF make to our nation. I've seen unmatched dedication, professionalism and commitment to our country. In the words and deeds of hundreds, if not thousands, of Australian men and women as they quietly went about their work I've seen a willingness to sacrifice and an eagerness to serve. We all know that the ADF keep us safe. With their professionalism and their skill they deter those who would seek to do us harm. They stand ready to defend us if the worst were to happen and our nation were put under direct threat. Across the world they work tirelessly to protect us from terrorism and they patrol the seas to help stop the flow of harmful drugs into Australia. They secure our coastline through Operation Sovereign Borders and they keep shipping lanes safe for our commerce in waters all across the globe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At home the ADF do a great deal to protect our economy and build local communities. When natural disasters like floods and cyclones hit, the ADF deploy to rescue those who are in danger, to protect property and to repair the destruction. Manufacturing the equipment of our troops requires the support of thousands of Australian workers. Their doctors and nurses work in our health service. In every community where an ADF base is situated they bring fresh and welcome prosperity. But the contribution of the ADF goes even further beyond our borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I joined many colleagues for 4 July celebrations aboard visiting supercarrier the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ronald Reagan</span>. The US and Australia are the closest of partners. At the heart of our partnership is the cooperation between our two militaries. We have stuck with each other through thick and thin since the trenches of World War I. As we've seen off the coast of Queensland just this week with Exercise Talisman Sabre, that cooperation into the future will ensure that our two countries continue to enjoy that close working relationship.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I thank my friend across the chamber the member for Fisher for moving this motion. I think it's important we do acknowledge the role of our serving men and women, their families and those who have come back as veterans, who are being looked after by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I do so having had the great privilege of being a Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and also a Minister for Veterans' Affairs in a previous government. I concur with the observations of the previous speaker about the immense importance, value, courage, dedication and commitment—all of those things—of our men and women in uniform. I don't think we can underestimate that value to any of us individually, collectively or nationally. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such sacrifice was made in the dark days of World War I and before that in the Boer War. Serving people left Australia ostensibly in Australia's interest—although some might argue that that was not the case in the Boer War—and they did so in uniform and willingly. We need to all understand that when they put that uniform on they are committing themselves to the possibility of sacrificing their lives—every one of them; men and women. I think we need to see the value in that and the value of their contribution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The average term of service for a defence person is seven to eight years. It's a young person's vocation. There are the lifers, absolutely—people who have careers as officers and become Chief of Army, Chief of Air Force and the rest of it, or Chief of the Defence Force—but the fact is that most don't. What we need to comprehend is that the sacrifices they make whilst they're in their uniform, especially if they've served overseas or are serving overseas, depending on the number of rotations they've done, may have a tremendous impact on them personally, either then or some time later. We're seeing the consequences of that in terms of the mental health issues which are confronting many of our veterans, and the suicide rates. We need to believe that we can do a lot better in assisting them when they come home. Importantly, also we need to understand that it's about families. The people who buttress our serving men and women when they come home, when they separate from the Defence Force, are their families. The people who look after them when they're injured, either mentally or physically, while in uniform are, more often than not, their families. We need to appreciate the sacrifices that families make, particularly children, when their parents are in the defence community. This motion calls us to recognise the support of their families and friends during their service, which we should do. It also acknowledges the positive social and economic impact that the men and women of our Defence Force have on our communities throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to very briefly talk about that contribution in the Northern Territory. Since the late 1980s, we've seen a significant movement north of defence personnel. Currently in the Northern Territory there are 5,336 uniformed and non-uniformed defence personnel: 3,311 in the Army, 1,100 in the Air Force, 630 in the Navy and 250 civilians. The value to the Northern Territory economy—and this is an important figure—is 8.4 per cent of gross state product, at a value of $2.1 billion. I don't think this is properly understood by the broader Northern Territory community, and it needs to be, because not only are these people serving for us but they are serving with us. They are living in our communities, their families are part of our communities and they are making an enormous contribution, both socially and economically, to those communities, and in this case particularly in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make particular reference to an organisation which is not often recognised: the Regional Force Surveillance Group. It was formed in 2018 to provide littoral surveillance and reconnaissance capability in Australia's north and north-west. It comprises the surveillance units NORFORCE, the Pilbara Regiment and 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment. Its commander is Colonel John Papalitsas, who resides at Larrakeyah. It has units operating right across northern Australia. Its most significant impact is through the support it gives to Indigenous people across the north—contributing, putting on a uniform and being part of NORFORCE. We need to acknowledge the group.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  It gave me great pleasure to second the motion. As you and other members would be aware, I served in the Australian Defence Force. I served as an infantry soldier in the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and doing so was my absolute pleasure. While deployed in East Timor and Afghanistan, I witnessed firsthand the commitment and dedication of the men and women of our armed forces—commitment and dedication on the battlefield, which is difficult for those who are left behind to see and fully understand. But, on the night of 3 February this year, that commitment and dedication was witnessed a lot closer to home. On that night in Townsville, the rain was pelting down and the Ross River was rising. Thousands of residents were on edge, not knowing if the water would reach their doorstep. Homes began to be inundated. Many of those homes were owned by members of the Defence Force. But if you were to go and visit those homes, you wouldn't have anyone there. They weren't sandbagging their doors, they weren't lifting their furniture up onto kitchen benches and they weren't packing their car and fleeing to higher ground. No, these people were doing that for others: sandbagging homes, saving belongings and risking their own lives to rescue the elderly, the infirm and others who had no other way of finding a safe place to weather the storm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While they could have been serving themselves, they were instead serving their community. At the height of the disaster, it was reported that up to 1,200 Defence Force personnel were assisting civil emergency services with evacuations. And, being a proud garrison city, most of these personnel lived in the Townsville community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recognise the support of the families and friends this morning. Let's not forget the husbands, wives, partners and children, themselves victims of this horrific event, who had to face the challenge head on without the help of their serving family member. Their sacrifice for the community cannot go unnoticed as they took on the stresses and worries of such an unprecedented disaster without their usual support mechanisms in place—not to mention those with family members deployed on active duty overseas already dealing with the difficulties which that entails—and had to face their own battles at home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the support of the Australian Defence Force personnel didn't end there on the night of the disaster. In the days and weeks following, Townsville streets were swarming with Army vehicles. Throughout the suburbs, our serving men and women spent their days cleaning up debris, washing out houses and trucking away potential hazardous furniture and household items to where they could be safely disposed of. Around 2,800 people spent much of February and March assisting Townsville City Council and emergency services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget Team Rubicon Australia who gathered the skills and expertise of the Defence Force veterans and set up shop at the Reid Park Pit Complex to assist with the recovery process. Team Rubicon, spearheaded by Geoff Evans, saw veterans and Defence Force personnel come from all around the country and all around the world to Townsville to help with our disaster and the clean-up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one example, but the immediate and ongoing response to the Townsville flood paints a vivid picture of the extent to which the men and women of the Australian Defence Force will serve not only their own country but their own community in times of need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the unique nature of military service and thank the men and women of the Australian Defence Force for their dedication to duty to our country and, of course, protecting our way of life on operations abroad. Townsville was hit with a one-in-500-years flood. The Australian Defence Force were out every night and every day helping our community. I'd like to thank them and pay tribute to them in the House today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  The people who serve our nation in the Australian Defence Force make an invaluable contribution to the safety and the prosperity of our nation. They put their lives on the line to protect and serve. I am so grateful to have the opportunity to recognise them and thank them for their service today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to extend my thanks to the member for Fisher for raising this important topic. He and I, as members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, had the opportunity to travel to the Avalon airshow and look at some of the incredible skills that the members of the Australian Defence Force acquire. We witnessed air-to-air refuelling and many other really specific and specialised skills that those people need to take on in order to provide the service to us that they do. Those people are absolutely vital to RAAF Base Williamtown, which is located almost exactly in the centre of my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I was elected in 2016, I've been fortunate enough to have had firsthand experience looking at the lives and service of service men and women who serve at RAAF Base Williamtown—both the sacrifices they make and the contribution they make to our community. Thousands of people call RAAF Base Williamtown home, and work. It's not unique to see a person in uniform picking up the kids from school, buying a coffee at the local coffee shop or dropping things off, as the day progresses, to family and friends throughout our community. It's not uncommon to hear the sound of world-class jets flying overhead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is an incredibly special thing to see them up close. Events such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day are made especially significant by the incredible number of people who come together to remember, recognise and thank our past and present ADF members. Our celebrations in Port Stephens are particularly poignant, when you see serving defence members en masse, there to recognise the importance of such days to all of us in our community. But it really does bring it home when you see a large group of people in uniform on Anzac Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The families of our Defence Force, as the member for Lingiari noted just a moment ago, are the buttresses, though. They are the people they return home to, whom they are able to confide in and download some of those pressures of the work of the Australian Defence Force—mothers, fathers and siblings, who support their kids as they travel across Australia and the world, eagerly awaiting a phone call or a return home visit. Husbands, wives and children who move from base to base, from town to town, are forced to pack up the house, unpack the house, make new friends at school and find new doctors and dentists. These are things that many of us just take for granted, but it's not until you've lived that lifestyle that you realise just how difficult it can be for family members to make those sacrifices and really turn their world upside down so that our world can be just that bit safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some fantastic community programs in Williamtown for those families who are being relocated to our area. We have a great community in Port Stephens that really understands the pressures of defence families and welcomes them in. We're used to welcoming people in, and I'm so proud that our local community does that, with such eagerness and tenderness. Tomaree Education Centre has a great program for children of defence personnel to help them make that transition. If you've ever been somewhere and realised how difficult it is to make friends—well, this program makes it easier for people to do so. So, I wanted to especially mention them and say thankyou for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to quickly give a special mention to Senior Australian Defence Force Officer Group Captain Peter Cluff—Cluffy, you do an amazing job—and to Air Commodore Barbara Courtney, who recently took over the Surveillance and Response Group from Air Commodore Craig Heap. Welcome, Barbara; thank you, Heapy, for what you've done for our base—and thank you to everyone who serves in the Australian Defence Force.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  Tasmania has a long and proud history of serving in the Australian Defence Force. In my electorate of Bass the Paterson Barracks—which is in the process of being moved to a new location, partly funded by the coalition government—is the home of the 16th Field Battery, which is the oldest artillery unit in Australia. From as far back as the Boer War, where over 800 Tasmanians served, through to our most recent involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq and the many peacekeeping and humanitarian operations across the world, thousands of men and women have made an outstanding contribution as part of our defence forces. We are fortunate to have heard from them firsthand in this place about their service and sacrifice and about the ongoing challenges faced by those who have served our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would especially like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and pay tribute to the support provided by the families and friends of our serving Defence Force, particularly the partners and children of serving members who are overseas. It is not an easy life to be part of a defence family, and the sacrifices made by the families of defence personnel ought to be recognised. They are often separated from loved ones and support them through those often lifelong physical and mental consequences of their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost a decade prior to being elected as the member for Bass, I was an elected member of the George Town Council. Like many regional towns in northern Tasmania, George Town has a proud history of Defence service. On occasions such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day the community come together in great numbers to reflect and commemorate. It is on these occasions that we see the community support that exists for our Defence personnel, past and present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time at the council I was fortunate to develop a close relationship with the local RSL sub-branch. For various reasons, the club had encountered some difficulties that led to the closure of their building. But with the assistance of the council and the dedication of the volunteer membership of the sub-branch, they were able to re-establish themselves in a disused room in the town's memorial hall. A few years later, with the support of the state Liberal government, they moved into a new main street location. This has allowed them the opportunity to connect with the community, to host important commemorative occasions, such as Anzac Day, and to house an extensive memorabilia display as well as provide space for welfare and advocacy. The journey of the RSL sub-branch from decline to renewal highlighted to me the positive social impact the defence community have on the wider community. Membership has increased and the main street is reinvigorated by their presence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is also home to a growing defence industry, providing niche capabilities for the ADF and exporting world-class technology around the globe. I am especially proud of the government's $30 million phase 1 investment in the Tasmanian defence innovation and design precinct at the University of Tasmania's Australian Maritime College. This will help drive defence related research and development projects, creating more jobs in Launceston and a world-class research precinct. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By supporting phase 1 of the research and design precinct, the Morrison government is supporting the high value testing and evaluation needs of the Royal Australian Navy, increasing opportunities for greater collaboration between defence, academia and industry to deliver cutting-edge defence capability and to build the AMC's capability to support the national shipbuilding college as it builds the workforce of the future, to deliver on the national naval shipbuilding plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We estimate an additional 150 jobs in the region will be created each year, which is a significant boost for the economy of Bass. Additionally, we expect up to 58 jobs will be created during the construction program. I have already met with Minister Reynolds to discuss the rollout of this project and look forward to working with the minister as this substantial project gets underway. This is another example of the way in which the defence forces in Australia are connecting the community and the economy. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  As a member for parliament I've had the opportunity to do and experience things I would never have previously dreamed of. In 2017 I participated in a visit to Australian defence personnel in the Middle East and Afghanistan, where we lived and trained alongside personnel for 10 days. That opportunity gave me a valuable insight into the lives of the men and women in our defence forces. We had the opportunity to learn of their experiences on the ground and to ask what we as their elected representatives can do to further support them in their roles, both here in Canberra and across the country. Our Navy, Army and Air Force do an incredibly challenging job in often very difficult circumstances and it is important that we always support them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Western Australian MP and a dad, I'm very conscious of the toll taken on any families by a FIFO lifestyle. When I went to the Middle East, I remember standing at Darwin airport watching a Defence Force mum saying goodbye to her young family before flying out on her deployment with us. While over there, I spoke to countless troops—sailors, airmen and airwomen—about their families, who go up to six months or more without being reunited. That really brought home the personal sacrifice of each and every individual on the frontline and behind the scenes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week this was reinforced. I had the opportunity to take part in Exercise Talisman Sabre in Queensland, the principal biennial Australian and US military training exercise that combines our naval, army and air forces in high-end war fighting. I want to thank all of the ADF personnel that enabled my visit. I have nothing but respect and admiration for our ADF members. We have an obligation to ensure that all of our personnel are kept safe, here and abroad, both mentally and physically. The same goes for when they come home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a person enlists in the Australian Defence Force, they undertake a commitment to our country and, necessarily, maybe placing their health and wellbeing on the line in service to our nation. In return, we are compelled to look after them and their families, both during and after their time in the Defence Force. This commitment is more than just about their physical health. It is about taking a holistic view of the member and their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a duty to care for those who service has had a greater impact on, and their families, now and into the future. When an individual serves in the ADF, their family serves with them. Military families make so many sacrifices. As I said before, we're well aware that many service men and women are deployed for months at a time. This separation would no doubt cause emotional stress for them, their partners and their children. When personnel are not on deployment, they are on regular repostings to different bases around the country, meaning that they have to choose between uprooting their whole family and living apart for periods of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The various defence establishments around the country are not all bad, though. They also go a long way towards stimulating local economies, particularly in regional centres like Townsville, which thrive from the economic contributions of personnel and their families being based there. The Department of Defence estimates that defence activity in the region contributes approximately 20 per cent of the gross regional product. The presence of defence facilities in regional areas not only increases spending in local communities; it results in increased social and environmental support and investment, community involvement, educational and training opportunities and health access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, a significant number of veterans make great contributions to the defence industry long after they've hung up their boots, making an ongoing contribution to our nation. For example, more than 20 per cent of Boeing's defence subsidiaries—Boeing Defence Australia and Insitu Pacific—are veterans, and many are in management positions. Last year, Boeing Defence Australia was recognised for its support and recruitment of veterans and received the inaugural Prime Minister's veterans' employment award, Veterans' Employer of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Defence Force personnel put their lives on hold in the service of our country. They take risks and make sacrifices, sometimes committing their lives and wellbeing for the good of the country. In return we must do everything in our power to support them. As I've heard at meetings of local RSLs and from family and friends, and as I've discussed with many constituents in my electorate, these risks and sacrifices, mental and physical, are very real. They are hard to manage. They take a huge toll on individuals and on families. Veterans and their families need our full political and community support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I take this opportunity to thank all of our soldiers, sailors and aviators, deployed across the globe and based all around Australia, for everything that they do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Life's most persistent and urgent question is: what are we doing for others? That was the question posed by Martin Luther King, which succinctly puts into perspective the very reason why so many dedicated people around the world are working on humanitarian causes. I move this motion in commemoration of World Humanitarian Day, the day that the international community unites to recognise the significant work of various organisations and their people in providing humanitarian relief around the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we often reflect on the efforts of our service personnel in peacekeeping roles abroad, it is very important that we also recognise the selfless contribution of civilians on the front line in various parts of the world. For the millions of people caught up in crises and natural disasters, the families who are forced to flee their homes for uncertain futures, the vulnerable groups which are systematically targeted and, importantly, the children whose future has been placed on hold, on this day and on their behalf we pay tribute to the many aid workers who risk their lives in serving people in need. We also honour the lives of those aid workers who have been killed while bringing relief and care to those in desperate need. In particular on World Humanitarian Day, we honour the significant role that women play in the crises across the world. They are the unsung heroes who have long been working on the front lines to save others in some of the most high-risk environments. As parliamentarians we must work to ensure that they and all humanitarian workers are afforded the protections that they are so entitled to under international law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's commemoration marks 16 years since the attack on the United Nations office in Baghdad, in which the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 other fellow humanitarian workers lost their lives in the service of peace, development and human rights. Since that tragedy, which led to the designation of World Humanitarian Day on 19 August, the United Nations estimates that over 4,000 aid workers have been killed, injured, detained or kidnapped. That's an average of 300 humanitarian aid workers killed, detained or injured every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the world, in conflict zones in countries including Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen, we're seeing people being forced in record numbers from their homes, with more than 65 million people now displaced, according to recent statistics by the United Nations. These statistics put in perspective the pressing need for action in regard to Australia's role in provision of international aid. The government's $11.3 billion cuts to the Australian aid budget have delivered the weakest level of Australian development assistance in history. Our common humanity demands bipartisan commitment to this matter. We should be working towards increasing our contributions to at least 0.5 per cent of our gross national income to keep pace with other developed nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On World Humanitarian Day, we pay tribute to all those aid workers who have lost their lives in the service of peace, we honour their sacrifice, we mourn with their families and we carry forward their memory as we strive to resolve and prevent armed conflict and work towards a prosperous and peaceful world for all. I take this opportunity to thank all those aid organisations working across the globe in some of the most difficult conditions and environments. In particular, I acknowledge the great work of Save the Children, Oxfam, UNICEF, APHEDA, World Vision, Caritas and many, many others and the immense amount of work they do to bring relief and aid to those in need in various vastly challenged areas of our globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude with the words of the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, which resonate strongly amidst today's climate of uncertainty and turmoil:</span>
              </p>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I second the motion. I want to use my contribution to this debate to talk about some of the people and organisations in my own community who engage in humanitarian aid. These are often people who come and see us to lobby members of parliament about increases to the aid budget but they are very often also people who put themselves in harm's way, who raise money for aid projects around the world and who are there to benefit mankind. Many of the organisations that come and see me are Christian organisations whose basis for working in the aid sector comes from the Gospel of Matthew, that they should love their neighbour, that they are called to love and serve the least of their brothers and that loving our neighbour extends to our neighbours all around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I've been a member of parliament, I've been regularly visited by representatives of the Thornleigh Community Baptist Church on issues of foreign aid, whether that's been about the quantum or where that aid is being directed. That church has shown a particularly strong interest in all aspects of aid policy from raising funds to engaging in active volunteering projects. They've spoken to me and other MPs and participated in the Voices for Justice conference hosted by Micah Australia in Canberra each year, where hundreds of Christians come to advocate on behalf of the global poor for increases in aid. This year, the Thornleigh Community Baptist Church also raised over $40,000 for its Christmas appeal. Last year, the funds went to the food crisis in Yemen and East Africa, drought relief in rural New South Wales and the establishment of a free community legal clinic. Every May, the Thornleigh Community Baptist Church raises over $40,000 for mission work around the world, including audiology clinics in the Pacific Islands, vocational training centres in Indonesia and leadership development training in the Middle East. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The TCBC are very proud of their education project in the Solomon Islands. For the past four years, their young adults aged 18 to 30 have partnered with a village in East Honiara in the Solomons to establish an early education centre. They've focused on empowering and financially supporting gifted local female teachers to make their vision of education for all in their community a reality. The centre has 70 students, aged three to seven, who mostly come from poor families with illiterate parents. Usually they'd miss out on the most basic education as children, and struggle to keep up at primary school, with many dropping out before the age of 12. This school is greatly improving the educational prospects of poor children in the Solomons and helping them break the cycle of poverty. Every year, TCBC's youth pastor, Todd Darvas, who is one of the most impressive leaders I've met in our community, leads a team of young adults in their first year out of high school to visit the school. These teams have raised over $20,000 in four years to support the school, which is about to build three new classrooms and grow their impact in the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to pay tribute to the work of Rotary in East Timor, led by the chair of the Rotary education training group, Theo Glockemann OAM, who is a member of the Rotary Club of Pennant Hills. Rotary operates two residential leadership programs for young people, and they're well known to members: Rotary Youth Leadership Award for adults under 26, and Rotary Youth Program of Enrichment for school leavers facing unemployment and challenging futures. Shortly after Timor gained independence in 2002, Theo brought together selected Timorese students to Sydney for our district RYLA program. After a core of Timorese delegates had a RYLA experience, Theo and his team decided to export RYLA to Timor, as leadership is absolutely critical to that country's future. They raised funds from within Rotary in 2010 and 2011; however, it became apparent that, without a sponsor, the work would not be sustainable. In 2012, Theo Glockemann secured the sponsorship of Woodside Energy and its joint venture partners Shell, ConocoPhillips and Osaka Gas, and they've sponsored the program ever since. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program has equipped many young East Timorese with the knowledge and skills to step into leadership roles in industry and civil society. Since 2010, there have been 1,000 RYLA alumni, over 300 of whom continue to study at university; over 160 have full-time jobs, many in leadership positions. Timor RYLA is now 95 per cent managed by its own trained facilitator team and receives over 800 applications every year. RYPEN has seen similar growth since it started in 2013, and is running in multiple districts in Timor. These successful programs represent an immense opportunity for young people in Timor to make a future for themselves. I want to acknowledge Angelo Raveane, David Boyce, Eddie Pinto and other members, 14 Rotary clubs strong, whom Theo has led to Timor every year since 2008, along with an army of East Timorese volunteers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great opportunity today, presented by the member for Fowler, to draw attention to two of the community organisations in our electorate that are making a real difference to the world through their participation in aid programs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  We live in a period of unprecedented turmoil. Every day, in dozens of countries, humanitarian crises are unfolding, with millions of people being impacted. Across the globe, 65 million people are displaced from their homes as a result of conflict. According to last year's <span style="font-style:italic;">Global Humanitarian Overview</span>, 134 million people needed humanitarian assistance and protection. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the United Nations has designated 19 August as World Humanitarian Day, a day to remember the devastating human cost of conflict and disaster across the planet and the critical role that humanitarian action plays. It's also a day to pay tribute to humanitarian workers for their incredible contributions. They place themselves in the path of danger, often at great personal risk, in order to help others in need. This year, World Humanitarian Day is particularly focused on celebrating women humanitarian workers. A large number of global humanitarian workers are women. They are amongst the first to respond to and the last to leave a crisis. I am very glad that, this year, they're being recognised for their contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was privileged enough to see the positive impacts of aid work firsthand when I visited Bangladesh back in November 2017 at the invitation of humanitarian organisations CARE Australia and Oxfam. At that stage, more than 700,000 Rohingya people, mostly women and children, were fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, and walking en masse across the border into Bangladesh in order to seek protection. This mass exodus from Myanmar, over a very short period of time, saw the rise of some massively overcrowded refugee camps throughout Cox's Bazar. There were thousands of traumatised people living in cramped, makeshift camps stretching out for kilometres—as far as the eye can see—and this was one of the most confronting sights I've ever encountered. The concentration of refugees in Cox's Bazar is amongst the densest in the world. There are more Rohingya people living in Bangladesh than their homeland of Myanmar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cox's Bazar also gave me some really unique insights into the work of humanitarian aid workers, which surely must be the most noble of all professions. The women I saw undertaking the work at the women's-only clinics were a really important part of the work being done in Cox's Bazar, ensuring the health and wellbeing of mothers and children. As I said, more than half of the refugee population of Cox's Bazar were, indeed, children. The women aid workers played a role in that really critical time when there was a need for great protection of women and children, who had already been subject to some of the most gross forms of violence that you could imagine. The women were an essential part of ensuring that those services were properly targeted. At that time, when so many people were arriving, the trust of having those women there was absolutely essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But none of those efforts could have happened without funding. Last year the United Nations estimated that we needed more than $25 billion across the globe to help more than 100 million people who were in need. The actual amount that was spent was just $15 billion, a shortfall of almost half of what was needed. That means not enough is actually being done. Regretfully, Australia is one of the worst offenders here. In 2008, in his very first speech in this House, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, praised the government for increasing foreign aid, adding that Australia, 'still must go further'. He went on to condemn the fact that the global aid budget was only a third of what was needed saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This leaves a sizeable gap. The need is not diminishing, nor can our support. It is the Australian thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to imagine, but this man who spoke with such passion and strength about the importance of aid is the same man who supported more than $11 billion of cuts into Australia's aid budget since the Liberals came to power. Indeed, many of those cuts were at his own hand when he was the Treasurer. And as Prime Minister he oversaw a further $115 million cuts in the last April budget. It is time that those opposite stood up and started acting like a responsible government by reversing some of the damage that they have done by cutting our overseas aid budget.</span>

                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I thank the member for Fowler for moving this motion and bringing this debate to parliament. World Humanitarian Day, 19 August, is one of many United Nations days which are there to encourage the global community to celebrate certain achievements and to educate people, but also, importantly, to mobilise political will and resources to address common global problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is two purposes for this day and I'll touch on each. The first purpose is to pay tribute to aid workers across the world who risk their lives in humanitarian service. We heard the shocking statistic that every year at least 300 aid workers are killed, detained or injured just for going about their jobs. They're unsung heroes and often women. Societies across the world always laud military service and that's appropriate. We had a debate earlier today in this chamber about those who serve—the sacrifice and the ideals that that represents—putting their lives at risk, and that is appropriate. It's visible and it's understood. Of course, there is a darker side of nationalism if that's overdone in some societies, but I think we get the balance right in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must take care not to forget other forms of service where people's lives are also at risk. The situation globally is the gravest since World War II. We have more than $65 million people displaced in the world due to conflict, who are unable to live in their homes. Millions are caught in conflict zones, living in conflict zones, in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, just to name a few. They struggle to access food, water, safe shelter or medical assistance. Providing aid and help to people in these areas is, of course, dangerous work. Shockingly, aid workers are directly targeted by combatants, treated as threats by many to their political objectives and harassed or prevented from going about their life saving work. I think it's fair to say we can all agree on that part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second purpose of World Humanitarian Day is to rally support for people affected by crises globally. It is not just war or violent conflict or humanitarian disasters but it's all of the other things we see across the Asia-Pacific—330 million people are living in extreme poverty and 1.5 billion people are still unable to access safe sanitation or water and are malnourished. In a civilised world, in a decent world and in a safe world I think we would face up to this reality and not accept global poverty at this level. People are starving. They have no prospects of fulfilling their human potential. This requires more than words. It requires nations, those in a position to do so, to be generous and play their part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, I rise to condemn this Liberal government's $11.3 billion cuts to the Australia's International Development Assistance Program. It says everything you need to know that despite the member for Newcastle, quoting the Prime Minister in his first speech to parliament, applauding a rise in the aid budget, this government, under this Prime Minister, has cut $11.3 billion. They can't even fill the speakers list for this debate. They've got three speaking slots on this motion and yet they had one bloke turn up and talk about stuff that's done in his electorate. I noticed—listening to the member for Berowra, who made a lovely speech there—he talked about people who come to his office and talk about the quantum of the aid budget. What he meant by that is cuts. It's the Christian church organisations like Micah—that fantastic organisation that pushes these values—that are in their offices calling them out for record cuts that they've made to the aid budget. Australians and the government should be ashamed that our level of investment in the region and, more importantly, globally, is at the lowest level on record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You talk to people in the community and they say, 'Charity begins at home,' but that is said with an impression that we're somehow handing out most of our national wealth and giving it away in cheques. The fact is we now give around 20c in every hundred dollars. We're one of the wealthiest nations in the world and around 20c in every hundred dollars is all this government can find to deal with the people in the world living in the most extreme poverty. The government should be ashamed. I believe we can do better than 20c in every hundred dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'll summarise the reasons I think this is important. Firstly, this is who we are as a people. We have a proud history in Australia of doing our bit in the region and of not forgetting our debts from World War II to East Timor and Papua New Guinea and our neighbours. Secondly, it's good international citizenship and—this may resonate more with the people over there—it's in our national interest. It is one of the four key pillars of our foreign engagement, alongside defence, foreign policy and trade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  When I was last speaking on this matter, I was talking about the very poor rollout of the government's NDIS and the way it had been impacting on constituents in my electorate and, no doubt, on constituents of most of the electorates represented by members here. Unfortunately, the issue that we get to deal with in my office on a very, very regular basis is several complaints from various frustrated constituents with regard to the inefficient coordination between planners, local area coordinators and the staff of the NDIA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent discussion paper published by Autism Advisory &amp; Support Service they argue that much of the miscommunication has resulted from the participants being forced to justify their need in order to have the funds and support of services restored to them. Bear in mind, the NDIS is a system where we're bringing together a number of existing state systems that look after people in need—people with disabilities. This is having all sorts of consequences, particularly for those coming from migrant backgrounds. In many cases, insufficient funding for support services and the wait times for reviews have seen participants incur significant out-of-pocket costs. With the unexpected surge in applications for a review of plans, waiting times for a review of plans for people with disabilities can be anything up to six months. The consequence of that is that it simply can't be afforded by people with disabilities or families looking after children with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With my community, another aspect of it is that Western Sydney has received one-fifth of Australia's recent refugee intake. Local service providers, particularly in Fairfield and Liverpool, have been put under considerable strain and pressure as they try to assist families to settle and integrate into our local community. The lack of funding to support these services has meant that there has been a reduction in the level of critical settlement service activity in my electorate. As members of parliament, I believe we have an obligation to show leadership and influence better outcomes for people. We must effectively invest in the settlement of refugees. We must ensure that they are given the same opportunities to contribute to our society, rather than allowing them to fall through the cracks and revert to some form of unsafe methods or systems of support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect which takes some prominence in my community is the issue of human rights. The issue of human rights is one that my community is very passionate about, given the make up of my community. Many people in my community come from war-torn countries—particularly from Cambodia, Vietnam and other areas—and have taken refuge in this country. As a parliament, our position on human rights should be firm. It should be unwavering. This is especially the case given our membership to the United Nations Human Rights Council. There are far too many situations of human rights abuses within our region for us to turn a blind eye regardless of issues around trade relationships. Whether it be the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, the arbitrary detention of the Uyghurs in China, the treatment of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, the crackdown on the freedom of expression and threat to democratic processes in Cambodia or even the oppression of basic rights and freedoms in Vietnam, we must call out bad behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent statement issued by the director of Human Rights Watch Australia, Elaine Pearson, she says that this government has always preferred an approach of 'quiet diplomacy' when addressing human rights violation within our region. Simply put, we have a moral and legal obligation to ensure that, where we seek to maintain and benefit from trade relations with our neighbours, we must also be committed to ensuring that human rights abuses, wherever they occur, are promptly addressed. On that matter, I commend the government and the minister, in particular, for supporting the UNHRC's resolution for the investigation into the human rights situation in the Philippines. Australia should continue to use our voice as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council to demand justice for victims and to ensure that human rights violators are held accountable for their crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again take the opportunity to thank my constituents for entrusting me with the honour of representing them in our federal parliament. It is an honour that I never take for granted. I hope I can live up to their expectations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  It is an honour to rise in this House again, as the re-elected member for Forde, for my fourth term. The electorate of Forde sits in the heart of South-East Queensland, a region abundant in natural beauty and rich in cultural heritage and history. My electorate spans from the city of Logan in the north to the emerging northern Gold Coast in the south. It is an electorate that represents all that is great about Australia. I am proud to have grown up in the area and raised my two sons there with my beautiful wife, Judi.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Forde is a place that many Australians call home. Importantly, these people who call Forde home represent generations of Australians—those who have come here more recently as well as those who have been here for millennia. It also is a place that those who have travelled from far and wide choose to call home. These are the people the Prime Minister referred to as the 'quiet Australians'. It is because of these quiet Australians that I am humbled to continue my responsibility to represent the people of Forde in this great hall and these chambers of the House—the centre of our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I begin a new term, it's worthwhile to review what has been achieved in Forde over the past three terms that I have represented the electorate, with a coalition government that is working for families, for retirees and for small business owners across my electorate. We've worked in previous parliaments to ensure that we've had a solid foundation to enable the hardworking residents of the electorate to be rewarded for their hard work, for their enterprise and for their innovation. We do this knowing that the people who earn the money are the ones who are best positioned to determine where and how that money is spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of our hard work over the past six years as part of the Morrison government that we are delivering our first budget surplus in over 12 years. Our strong fiscal policy and economic management means that Australia's economy remains strong and will continue to benefit the residents of my electorate and of Australia. Residents in my community are benefiting from 28 years of uninterrupted economic growth, and over 73,000 taxpayers in Forde alone will now have started to reap the rewards of this government's tax cuts to lower- and middle-income earners. I remain focused on reducing the cost-of-living pressures for households across Logan and the northern Gold Coast, but it was always a challenge, considering the position of those opposite. Our tax plan will give the hardworking people of Forde the best opportunity and platform in life to reach their goals and aspirations—not hold them back, as those opposite seek to do. I will fiercely continue to defend the government's position of lower taxes against what those opposite proposed in the recent election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of my electorate are also benefiting from our plans for small business. Small business is the bread and butter of my community. There are over 15,000 small businesses in the electorate of Forde that will benefit from the tax relief plan for small business. These are small and family businesses like CG's Coffee &amp; Grub at Bethania and G1 Asset Management at Yatala. They are benefiting from the fast-tracked business tax cuts. I want to see business grow in my electorate, and it is our plan that small business will see the incentive to grow and prosper and employ more Australians. This is why, through the increase in the instant asset write-off, small business will be able to write off those assets that they purchase to operate their business. This instant asset write-off will increase from $25,000 to $30,000 and can be used every time an asset under that amount is purchased. This will stimulate the economy and enable a cafe to get a new fridge or grill, a plumber to buy new tools or a courier to buy a new van.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud to be part of a government that has increased funding for public hospital services in Queensland by 78 per cent since we came into office, despite the constant mistruths perpetuated by the opposition candidate during the election campaign. I'm glad to see that the residents of Forde saw through their smear tactics and realised that funding to Logan Hospital has increased by some 65 per cent and has doubled at the Griffith University hospital since Labor was last in government. I look forward to working with the state government on delivering the $33.4 million in funding towards the urgent and specialist care centre for Logan Hospital, and I hope we will see an end to Labor's health lies in the years to come. This government will also invest some $31 billion to public hospitals over the next five years and $310 billion towards public education in the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing in all of this and the difference between this government and those opposite is that we deliver on our promises and they don't. Under this government, Medicare spending is guaranteed and is increasing every year, from $24 billion in 2017-18 to $28.8 billion in 2021-22, to ensure every Australian has access to our world-class healthcare system. It is this coalition government's strong economic management that is delivering continued record investment in our vital health system, ensuring its long-term sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Forde last year, over 1.2 million GP visits were bulk-billed—over 300,000 more than when Labor was last in government, in 2012-13. The bulk-billing rate in my electorate is now at 95.8 per cent—more than it ever was under Labor. I am proud that we are delivering better health services, facilities and technologies and, importantly, improved outcomes for the constituents of my electorate, including through funding to upgrade the Logan Hospital children's ward; more real support for Beenleigh rehabilitation services' drug and alcohol treatment program and for Logan's Street Doctor, which provides health services for the homeless and disadvantaged; a new headspace centre for the northern Gold Coast; and grants for Brook RED and Meadowbrook headspace for ongoing specialist mental health services for children and teenagers, as well as their families and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is an important issue in Forde, which is why I invited the Prime Minister to Meadowbrook to learn about the valuable services that Canefields Clubhouse provides to people living with mental illness. It was a rewarding and humbling experience to join the Prime Minister and members of Canefields in the simple act of cake decorating, which is one of the many ways Canefields Clubhouse supports their members in developing their trust and socialisation abilities, to say nothing of the fantastic artwork that many of the members of Canefields also do. Equally, on that day I was pleased to announce with the Prime Minister $1.6 million in funding to Canefields Clubhouse, which will assist them on their path to becoming fully self-sufficient so they can continue to provide valuable mental health services for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I were to single out one health achievement just delivered in Forde it would be the granting of a new fully Medicare funded MRI licence to Qscan Radiology for their new clinic in Upper Coomera. Upper Coomera is one of the fastest growing regions in my electorate and across Australia. As a burgeoning community, it's critical that this area has local access to MRI services for lifesaving scans for cancer, stroke, heart and other medical conditions. This MRI licence means that locals will be able to access a Medicare rebate for an estimated 5,900 services a year, saving lives and reducing the costs for patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not alone in understanding and appreciating the importance of these facilities for families facing travel and the stress of dealing with serious medical conditions. There could be no stronger statement of support made than by appointing a Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I am grateful that the Prime Minister feels so committed to supporting Australians with a disability that he decided to bring the NDIS directly into cabinet. The NDIS represents a significant shift in the delivery of services for people with a disability, and our National Disability Strategy will transform the lives of young people with permanent and significant disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to acknowledge the thousands of people not just in my electorate but across South East Queensland, from learner drivers just starting their journey to families, business owners, commuters and those working in the transport industry, such as couriers and truck drivers, who keep the Australian economy moving. I'd like to thank all of the Queenslanders who got behind my Fix the M1 campaign. I'd like to thank the member for Bonner, here in the chamber, for being part of that as well. I'm proud to say that your support for my campaign is beginning to deliver a safer and quicker drive, with upgrades already underway and funds already budgeted. Too much precious time is taken away from home and loved ones with residents of Forde travelling on the M1, which often feels more like a car park than a freeway. With the Prime Minister I was proud to have committed over $1 billion in congesting-busting funding to the M1. I'm focused on getting residents of Forde home sooner and safer. This includes $347.5 million for the Eight Mile Plains to Daisy Hill stretch and another $500 million towards the Daisy Hill to Logan Motorway upgrade. This will ensure the M1 is eight lanes from Nerang to the Gateway—the way it should have been built in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also committed to ensuring our local roads are safe. I look forward to seeing my election commitments come to fruition, particularly in the City of Logan, where the federal government has committed $2.5 million to the upgrade of High Road and Easterly Street in Waterford, $11.5 million for the Chambers Flat Road upgrade between Park Ridge Road and Derby Road, and in Beenleigh to upgrade the current mismatch of road surfaces and lane widths on Beaudesert-Beenleigh Road between Milne Street and Tallagandra Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look forward to delivering our new commuter car parks at Loganlea, Beenleigh and Coomera train stations, which will provide the residents of Forde with more and safer car parking spaces. This valuable investment in our public transport network will incentivise commuters across Logan and the Gold Coast to use public transport to get home sooner and safer. I'm proud to be a member of a government that invests in our road and transport infrastructure, because it is good for not only commuters but our economy and Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also no secret that I'm a big fan of sport, which is why I take this opportunity to recognise the outstanding achievements of many up-and-coming sporting champions across the electorate of Forde. In fact, the homegrown talent in my electorate that has gone on to achieve international success includes the very recognisable names of Corey Parker and Cameron Smith for rugby league, Jodie Henry for swimming, sprinter Trae Williams, and Alex Leapai for boxing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow's sporting superstars are being nurtured on our school ovals and in gymnasiums across sporting clubs in my electorate of Forde. Sport brings together people from all different backgrounds and it is the foundation of the strong community spirit that we enjoy. This is why I've committed valuable federal government funding towards upgrading the oval at Marsden State High School and building new changing rooms at Logan Lightning Football Club in Beenleigh. This investment in our local sporting hubs will allow local schools and sporting groups to train and foster emerging sports men and women into the future. The people of Forde are proud of our sporting heritage and we look forward to watching the champions of the future sign their names in the national and international halls of fame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look forward to seeing students and families of all abilities enjoying the new facilities on the oval at the Kimberley Park State School, thanks to our commitment to building disability access to the oval and terracing. Eagleby and Norfolk Village state schools will also benefit from federal government funding towards the establishment of children's health and wellbeing hubs, greatly improving the services that the wonderful staff at both Eagleby and Norfolk Village already provide to our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every child deserves an education, no matter their ability. Being part of a school community is so much more than just learning how to read and write. I take this opportunity to recognise the students, teachers and families of Beenleigh Special School. When I visit I'm always inspired by the time, effort and care that is taken by the teachers, carers and helpers to help those students, many with severe disabilities, be the best that they can be. Importantly, this is supported by significant funding increases by this government across our public schools, our Catholic schools and our independent schools. It is this government that is investing in Australian children's education to ensure that our kids can be the best that they can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'd like to reflect and thank a number of people. As we stand in this place it is always worthwhile to reflect on how we got here and the collective effort of the many people that allow us the honour and privilege of representing our communities in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to recognise and acknowledge the efforts of those who helped ensure my re-election in Forde and, most importantly, the re-election of the coalition government. Firstly, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of the government's leadership team and thank Prime Minister Scott Morrison and ministers for visiting my electorate to provide us with the valuable support needed during the campaign. I'd also like to recognise the efforts of the amazing Senator Amanda Stoker, my patron senator. Your presence during my campaign was very much appreciated not just by me but by my staff and the wonderful volunteers, who were invigorated and inspired by your presence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to thank my FDC campaign team—Roger Emmerson, Joel Hall, Joel Prokic, Andrew Caswell, Pat Reynolds and Byron Sellan—for their support during the campaign. For many of you, this would be your second or third time supporting my re-election, and I thank you for your continued support. I also wish to thank my awesome staff—Byron, Vanessa, Jordan, Siobhan, Katie and Alannah. I would not have achieved the wonderful result we had without your tireless efforts not only during my election campaign but also in the weeks and months leading up to 18 May. Your dedication and performance were above expectations. For many of my staff, this was their first campaign, and can I say it was an outstanding effort for a terrific bunch of first timers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the generous contribution and support of the fabulous volunteers who helped me during the campaign. I had volunteers of all age groups and backgrounds helping me, and their involvement in my campaign was invaluable. I'd also like to especially acknowledge the support of the members of the young LNP. It was refreshing to see so many young and new faces being involved in politics. I also wish to acknowledge the many volunteers who belong to local sporting community groups, who supported me because of the relationships I've had the privilege of building over the last three terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank my beautiful family, who have always been by my side on my parliamentary journey. One of the only constant sources of encouragement to us in this House is the love and support of our families, which we could not go without. I'd like to acknowledge the tireless efforts and contribution of my beautiful wife, Judi, and our two sons, Zac and Josh. My wife, Judi, is the rock of my life, and I wish to thank her for all of the love, support and wise counsel she has given me—albeit I don't listen to it all the time! Your guidance and assistance to my campaign is invaluable. And to my sons, who have grown into two fine young men: you'll always find a way to step up. I'm a thankful and proud dad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I wish to extend my thanks and gratitude to the people of Forde, who've put their trust in me for another three years.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MCINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Mr Speaker, colleagues, family and friends that are here today, Lindsay is in so many ways a microcosm of the Australian community. It's got families, it's got retired people, it's got lots and lots of small businesses and it's got a very strong community spirit. These are the words of former Prime Minister Howard OM AC on his visit to Lindsay during the campaign—and, as always, former Prime Minister Howard is right—'From Menzies' forgotten people to Howard's battlers to Morrison's quiet Australians, Lindsay has been and will remain a microcosm of Australia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister Menzies called the forgotten people the backbone of our nation. In the 1950s, nowhere was this represented more than in outer Western Sydney. Penrith was a nucleus for the transformation of market farming into suburbia, where the aspirational working class were moving out of the city to secure their slice of the Australian dream and a better life for their families. Back then, most people travelled by train into the city only a couple of times a year. Today, hundreds of thousands of people commute out of Western Sydney daily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 1996 and the election of Jackie Kelly to Lindsay, Western Sydney had changed significantly. The outstanding win in Lindsay was so significant that we became the epicentre for the Howard battlers. This is because Prime Minister Howard was able to do what Menzies did before him: reach into people's hearts and light their aspiration. I had the privilege to work for Jackie Kelly and Prime Minister Howard. What I learnt most from both of them was the importance of spending time listening to and connecting with people and to have conviction. Today, Lindsay is very much the heartland of Morrison's quiet Australians. But as Menzies's forgotten people become our older Australians we must not forget them again, and as Howard's batters wind up their careers as hardworking Australians we must not forget them, just as Morrison's quiet Australians have not been forgotten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From working for Prime Minister Howard to working with Prime Minister Morrison, it is now my responsibility to ensure the aspirational people of Lindsay, working hard to get ahead for their families, continue to be listened to and fought for. It is with an enormous amount of gratitude to this microcosm of Australia, our community of Lindsay, that I humbly stand before you today to make my inaugural speech to parliament. Thank you for placing your trust in me to represent you and to deliver my plan for Lindsay, and, as Prime Minister Howard also said in Penrith that day, I promise to work for you very, very hard. I will fight for the people who are working hard for their families and commuting out of the area every day for a good job. They have said they don't want to be doing that long commute. They want jobs close to home. Today, only five per cent of people in Western Sydney live within 30 minutes of their work. As someone who commuted for over 10 years, there is nothing I want more for our community than good local jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will fight for our families who want a healthy community, better recreational and sporting facilities and a beautiful Nepean River. This is why I announced funding during the election to keep our river healthy and to upgrade Chapman Gardens in Kingswood and Penrith Valley Regional Sports Centre in Cambridge Park for all our families to enjoy. For the mums and dads who drive their kids to school, I'll fight—and for our tradies who use our roads for work. They've said they want less congestion and to get to where they're going, and home again, safer and quicker. There is nothing more on my mind than our community's safety and ensuring that people's loved ones get home, because I know the feeling when they don't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My husband, Stuart, would often cycle from home, in Emu Plains, to the Penrith Whitewater Stadium to train when he was an Olympic athlete. Cycling was just part of his training regime. One evening Stuart didn't come home. I called everyone we knew. I put the kids in the car and drove the route, back and forth, between our house and the stadium. Instinct told me where he was. I rang Nepean Hospital, and this is where I found him. Stuart had been hit by a car, on Castlereagh Road, and had flown off his bike onto his head. In that instant, the injuries he sustained ended his sporting career. Safer, less congested roads are very much part of my plan for Lindsay. I was so pleased that, thanks to the community's support for my petition, Prime Minister Morrison announced $63½ million for the upgrade to Dunheved Road, and I am very committed to its delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will fight for small businesses, like Emu Plains Automotive Repairs, Bubbles Florist, Kingswood Florist and the well-known cafes in Penrith—The Natural Choice, Thor's Cafe, Bethany's, and Ratha's Place in St Marys to name a few—people who are having a go. They have said they want to have a strong local economy and fewer taxes on their businesses so they can focus on what they do best for their customers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll fight for retired people, like 92-year-old Glad. She's in North St Marys, and I met her at her home. She lived alone and still tried to stay active in her garden. As our community ages I will ensure they are not forgotten. How fortunate are we when we have people in our corner, always, especially when we get older. When I meet people in our community who don't have this, it breaks my heart—women who, after years of contributing to our society, find themselves in older age experiencing homelessness and older people in their homes experiencing loneliness. This concerns me greatly and I've seen both while working in a social housing and homelessness organisation and doorknocking over months throughout our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important as people get older that they have a support network, whether family, friends or in the community. I know this firsthand. Just over two years ago my parents lost our family home of 40 years to fire, and every single material belonging they owned. I will never forget the feeling of not being able to get to them quickly enough, pulling my car over at the top of the street and running as fast as I could down its length, past fire trucks, police cars and people, with that terrible smell of fire getting stronger, and to turn the corner to see flames and the last remnants of the house burning. But we didn't lose my parents, and it is our families and friends, and their love for each other, plus my parents' inbuilt drive, that got them through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I worry for people who, in older age, don't have that, especially when they need it most. And I will fight to maintain our very strong community spirit. This is a foundation of a great community. In Lindsay, community spirit is not just in our foundation; we are full to the brim and overflowing with it. I'll never forget the day that a local man who I know doesn't have much for himself brought me a cup of tea and a slice of cake at prepoll. It was the community spirit that kept me going throughout the campaign, and I would like to thank everyone who was kind to me during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to be here for the opening of the 46th Parliament, where we honoured our country's First People. I would particularly like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land of Lindsay. There are over 6,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Lindsay, and there are many local organisations supporting our Indigenous community, like Nepean Community &amp; Neighbourhood Services in Cranebrook, whose breakfast club ensures that kids have something good to eat before they go to school. I was very pleased that I was able to secure funding for a new bus so that kids could be picked up from home to go to breakfast and then be dropped at school. Cheese-toastie Wednesdays are the best! I would like to give my happiest wishes to all the kids and families who visit the breakfast club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people I would like to thank who have played a special part in my journey to this place. I can't name you all, but there are a few I do want to mention—firstly, our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison: thank you for your time, support and advice. I am very grateful that your first stop during the election was in Lindsay, to visit our river, where you used to row as a kid, and you've been back a lot of times since. You are always very welcome. People in our community know that you are committed to us—except when our beloved Panthers play at Shark Park!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I want to mention my first, second and third political bosses—the former member for Lindsay, the Hon. Jackie Kelly, who gave me my first job out at Western Sydney University; Prime Minister Howard, who I had the privilege to work for here in Canberra at the age of 22; and the Hon. Alex Hawke, who I have long called friend and can now call colleague. I have served in the offices of each of you and have been the beneficiary of your political guidance, and it means a lot that you believed in me and are proud to see me in this place. Alex, thank you also for your support in my campaign for Lindsay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another powerhouse in our great Liberal Party who has been a mentor and friend is Senator the Hon. Marise Payne. My thanks to you—and the Hon. Stuart Ayres. I am fortunate to be able to work alongside you both now for the people of Penrith, Lindsay and Western Sydney, and with my state colleague from Mulgoa, the Hon. Tanya Davies; Penrith mayor Councillor Ross Fowler OAM and our Penrith Liberal councillors. I want to mention the Hon. Robert Hill AC, our former defence minister, who served as a senator for 25 years. Thank you for being here today. Robert, along with another great friend and mentor, who is also here—Kevin McCann AC—helped guide my way back to politics when we were together at the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney and, along with Craig Purcell, supported me to start my own think tank program at the centre; W21, the 21st century global women's initiative, allowed me to explore important issues around women and work, and to work with the world's best academics in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To former president of the New South Wales Liberal Party and good friend Nick Campbell and federal president Nick Greiner: you have both given me so much of your time and guidance and have helped support the political pathway of many women in our great Liberal Party. To New South Wales state director Chris Stone, deputy campaign director Luke Nayna and campaign officer Bonnie Marshall—always in my corner. Locally, there is my campaign team and the Lindsay conference, led by president Glenn Gardiner—and my special thanks to Moe Rumman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention our extended Liberal Party family, Alex Hawke's Mitchell conference, and the Hume and Bradfield conferences and their MPs, the Hon. Angus Taylor and the Hon. Paul Fletcher. I thank all of those whose support enabled us to run such a fantastic campaign and the volunteers who walked and stood with me over those many weeks of campaigning, some of whom are here today. I would like to acknowledge Fiona Scott, the former member for Lindsay; former New South Wales women's council president Chantelle Fornari-Orsmond; Scott; Maureen; and Deni Hastings. I thank the people for whom it didn't matter if it was a freezing cold morning at a train station or an all-day campaign; they were there. It was not only members of our Liberal Party but hardworking locals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all of my coalition colleagues who have supported me on the campaign and since entering the 46th Parliament. It is our Morrison government policies that are going to make hardworking people's lives better. It was very special for me to join you to pass the income tax cuts that mean that around 77,000 Lindsay residents, who are working hard and aspirational, will be keeping more of their own money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal level, I am a proud Liberal who is grateful for good Liberal Party policy. It was Menzies' 1950s policy that I can thank for being here today. In the late 1950s, a very important invitation from the Prime Minister travelled the seas to a little town in Austria called Graz. My dad had been through war and lost his whole family; he lost his mum, his dad and his sister. He was raised by his grandmother. When she died, there wasn't much to keep him there. He worked hard and saved. When he was 23 and the invitation came from Menzies to create a new home in Australia, dad was aboard that ship. He came with only a few material possessions, but one of the most important things he came with was his drive to have a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum had an equally modest upbringing. My grandmother was one of 12 children and life wasn't always easy. Just like with my dad, mum changed her life by working hard. When times were a bit tricky, she dug in and worked harder. Just to show how working hard has its benefits, it was through both of my parents working in the same manufacturing company, at a time when manufacturing was booming in Western Sydney, that they met and fell in love. Mum and Dad worked hard for what they built, and hopefully I received 100 per cent of the gene pool for hard work and aspiration. Growing up, I was enthusiastically encouraged to pursue my dreams. Taking responsibility, working hard for your success and love of family are attributes I am very grateful have been given to me by my parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does take a village to raise a family. It is a very noisy village, filled with all of our beautiful kids, that drives me most: my sister, Karen, and her family; my brother Craig, his wife, Belinda, and their kids; and my brother Conrad, who helped his little sister on the campaign, his wife, Debbie, and their children too. There are over 20 of us. Many are here today. I would like to acknowledge Shereen and Gavin from Queensland. My greatest thanks are to Rhonda and Edmund, the best mum and dad in the world. Thanks, Mum. Thanks, Dad. I thank my husband, Stuart, and our most beautiful, smart and caring children, who are everything to me. There is Byron, our 16-year-old: I am so proud of what he is achieving in year 11 as he gets ready for the next phase of learning. Coby, our 11-year-old, has such a wondrous interest in wireless connections and landline internet connections—anything that powers <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortnite</span>! There is Summer, who is so fast at running that it is now her mum saying, 'Wait for me.' Your encouragement and belief in me has allowed me to follow this political path. Thank you. I love you all greatly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My political journey isn't as straightforward as some who come into this place. How does one go from training all of their young life as a dancer to being a parliamentarian? They have Conrad and Penelope Helfrich, two of our country's legends in the performing arts industry, instil at a young age the lifelong practice of professionalism, grace and always being on time. I shan't ever be late to question time thanks to these two people, who are here today from Melbourne. Dancing was everything to me when I was young. One of my first memories of Penrith was performing in a talent quest on stage in the old Penrith High Street mall. It was to 'Eye of the Tiger', so it was definitely the eighties. You can imagine my delight when I walked into Friendship Day celebrations last week, which connects people with disabilities in our community, and heard that very song playing and saw the dance floor in full swing. How could I do anything but join in? Congratulations to NADO for such a beautiful day that brought everyone, including me, so much joy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My political career started with great enthusiasm when I was 21, fresh out of Western Sydney University. I am so proud to be an alumni of this world-class university and look forward to ensuring that it goes from strength to strength over the coming years as our children are educated in Lindsay's jobs of the future. The education I received here was the springboard for so many opportunities throughout my career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 23, I entered the corporate world. Like many young people—like many young women—I was rushing to get ahead and achieve it all before kids. I was also the girl from Penrith wanting to be the best and to take all the opportunities. People from Western Sydney are really committed; if you have to commute three hours a day or more for your job, you have to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then an experience changed things. I was given a wonderful opportunity to travel to New York for work. A couple of days out from my departure, the trip was cancelled. I was disappointed. I was going to be staying at the famous Twin Towers. I would have been in one of those towers on September 11. I will never forget that day, sitting in an almost empty office in Sydney, about 20 storeys up, overlooking Hyde Park, wondering what would have happened if I had made it to New York. Rushing for a career wasn't so important after that, so I put it on hold and I went travelling the world with Stuart and his sporting career. I also became a mum, and we visited over 20 countries with our first child, Byron, before he was one. He says he doesn't remember it. Travelling with a baby was an amazing and, at times, wonderful experience—overwhelming!—but it was one that made me value even more our beautiful country, which truly is the best in the world. When we returned home, my career changed paths again, including a time when I thought it would be a great idea to have my own small business and a travelling with kids website with my good friend Rebecca Collins, who is here today. Rebecca journeyed with me to create business ideas and inventions that would solve all the parental troubles of the world. How good are mum start-ups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All three of my children were born in Nepean Hospital like me, and I have always worked. I think the balancing act as a working mum is something that takes a lifetime of practice. Sometimes this has been very hard. I remember dragging myself onto the train at 7 am each morning for the long commute into the city for my job, very pregnant and very tired. Sometimes people didn't offer you their seat. Sometimes I would have been anywhere else but on that train. My story isn't very unique, particularly in Lindsay. It's about family, hard work, opportunities and aspiration. I think this has always been the Lindsay way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very fortunate to introduce the Premier of New South Wales at a Menzies Research Centre event, and I would like to acknowledge the Hon. Gladys Berejiklian for her support of my campaign. It was at this event that my friend and Menzies centre director, Nick Cater, declared me to one of the best thing to happen to Penrith since the first train in 1863. This is a wonderful compliment, as the introduction of the railway transformed Penrith which, right up until the First World War, served as a major railway town. Just as rail transformed Penrith in the 1800s, rail will again play a major role in its transformation in the future, with a north-south rail link from St Marys to Badgerys Creek opening in 2026 in time for the airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But rail won't be the biggest thing to happen to Penrith or, indeed, the whole community of Lindsay. This time, it will be air travel. With it, people in Lindsay finally will have the full potential to realise the aspirations they have always had. Western Sydney International Nancy-Bird Walton Airport has the potential to be transformational not only for Western Sydney but for our whole country. The blueprint that has been decades in the making is now being brought to life and the result will be thousands of jobs, expanded export opportunities and new industries that we haven't yet thought of. Every dollar invested by the government in the airport will generate $1.80 in return to our economy. By 2063, the airport will contribute over $5.8 billion per annum to our national economy, while business profits are forecast to increase by $2 billion a year. The key to unlocking all this is the aerotropolis and local jobs—in agriculture with local produce exported to Asia and the world, in tourism and advanced manufacturing, and even in world-class space manufacturing capability that could boost and transform our national space industry. But we aren't there yet. Building the puzzle and bringing it all together is going to be a huge task in persistence and determination, and it is what I'm committed to doing.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is: we have the smarts and the drive in Western Sydney, and it's time we stopped exporting them. No longer do people in Lindsay have to go somewhere else for their aspiration. People want to live, work and stay in our community, and, as parents, we want our kids to stay too. How do we move the dial so that more people can work where they live? The answer is in Lindsay. We ensure that Lindsay's world-class education institutions, which are going to be taking full advantage of Western Sydney's supercharged infrastructure development, are training our local kids in the jobs of the future. This starts in school and connects all the way through to post school education and workforce training. We also activate our full workforce potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, when I was at the US Studies Centre, I created and led the International Dialogue on Women in Leadership, a G20 event, in partnership with my friend Russell Trood at Griffith University. Sadly, Russell is no longer with us, and I would like to acknowledge his service as a senator. I hope, Russell, you would be proud that I am here. The international dialogue examined how we would reach the G20's target of reducing the gender gap in workforce participation by 25 per cent by 2025. Why are we doing this? For sustainable economic growth. In Australia, an increase in women's participation could add $25 billion to our country's economy. If we can do it as a nation we can do it in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Encouraging female workforce participation and providing opportunities in the industries that will feature with the development of the airport, manufacturing, agriculture, science and technology are going to be key to ensuring we are reaching our full workforce potential. I've seen it on a national and international level and I know it will work on a local level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I created a program for a community housing provider and consulted, again, with world-leading academics to transition women in social housing to economic and housing independence, it was their ability to find and sustain work that would ultimately transform their lives. Women who had experienced intergenerational welfare, women who were escaping domestic violence and women who had the aspiration just need the opportunities, and that's our Liberal way. There are many pieces to the puzzle. Educating our local Lindsay kids in the jobs of the future and activating our full workforce potential are just two that we can begin now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Prime Minister Morrison says, 'It's what we do now in policy making that will have a lasting outcome for the next 10 years and more.' It is so important we get it right. Not forgetting or leaving behind Howard's battlers and Menzies' forgotten people, it is now time for Morrison's quiet Australians of Lindsay to fulfil the aspirations we all share. There is never going to be a better opportunity for us to be front and centre driving our own economic future. A job within 30 minutes of home is just the start, not the end, of what we can achieve together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude with a quote that means something to me personally from the former US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You will make a difference in the world, but not immediately. Your first obligation is to find something you like doing, because if you like doing it, you'll do it well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love representing our community, working hard to fulfil their aspirations and delivering my plan for Lindsay and, with God's blessing, I hope I will do it well. That is why I could confidently say on election night, 'I will promise I won't let you down.'</span>

                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I offer my congratulations to the member for Lindsay. I wish her a long and fruitful career and great representation on behalf of her people, and I congratulate her on her maiden speech. On 27 April, on a rainy morning in Mackay, about 700 people gathered on the lawns of the Mackay Regional Council precinct to take a stand against the green lunatic fringe. They did what most of them had never done before—they protested. They were amazed that they had to do this, but they were fed up with the thousands of green lefties and commentators from thousands of kilometres away telling them what jobs they could have, what companies they could do business with and what future they could expect for their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Central and North Queenslanders could generally ignore the rants and rubbish flowing from the south; they just got on with their lives. But, when the announcement was made that a former Greens leader and ageing hippie from Tasmania was heading north with a convoy to save us from ourselves, that was the last straw. After disbelief—that people from as far away as Tasmania should be telling North Queenslanders what to do and think—came resolve, and then followed action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strangely enough, Bob Brown uttered some resounding words of wisdom, which are written on his website, and they explain exactly what happened when his convoy came to Central Queensland and North Queensland. Bob Brown said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When people stand up for what they believe in they have unbeatable power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Mr Brown was very much right on that point. The people of Central and North Queensland, and indeed across the rest of the state of Queensland, stood up for what they believed in and demonstrated that unbeatable power when they rejected Labor's weasel words on mining and the leanings of the green Left and handed the member for Maribynong a loss in what was being styled as the 'unlosable election' for the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to the economic development group which actually drove that protest to Mackay and to the other leaders in the community who supported its stance. The Resource Industry Network is a not-for-profit industry group which represents the small and medium sized businesses which benefit directly from the resources sector and associated industries. The Resource Industry Network swung into action to stick up for the region, creating a website, www.forthefutureofourregion.org.au. They produced 'Go Galilee' signs, T-shirts and even earrings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the words that were shared by our community leaders, as people gathered in the park, in the rain, on the first of two protest days. Resource Industry Network director Mick Crowe said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're here for our future. This isn't about whether a coalmine gets built or not. This is a protest about whether our industry has a future or not. We want to be heard. We'll be respectful. It's not about politics—it's about our town and our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mayor of Mackay, Councillor Greg Williamson, said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We support democracy. We support everybody who wants to have a voice. But don't come into our patch and say, 'You can't do what supports 60 per cent of your regional economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was joined by the Mackay Region Chamber of Commerce treasurer, Simon Vigliante, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's one degree of separation between coal and our livelihoods.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another Mackay Regional Councillor, former Rugby League great and now Green Shirts leader Marty Bella, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Mick Crowe, the director of the Resource Industry Network, summed it up when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to show Australia we're here, we matter and we need a future. We need to show all the people of Australia and the politicians of Australia that if you won't back our futures we can back you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said to the community, 'Help us get a voice.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking after the second rally, Mick Crow went on to say, 'We're the people who are going to live with the legacy of whether mining gets supported in this state. Are we in great shape as a region because of coal? Absolutely. Will we stay that way? Not if we don't build new mines. The Galilee is the platform that gives us 30 or 40 years. If we don't make that investment, if that doesn't happen, how do we explain the next 30 to 40 years apart from shrinking? It is logical. The world needs it. We're good at it. How do we make it happen?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The collective voice from this rally, and a second rally held about two weeks later, was: 'Galilee, Galilee, a future for our families.' At about the same time as the green activists were heading north to tell us what to do, a revelation came forth from the Australian Labor Party National Conference about their policies on mining jobs. Labor's plan was a just transition away from mining. Though Labor tried to paint this as some sort of scare campaign, the truth was there in black and white in Labor's policy documents. Labor promised to create a just transition authority, which would, according to their documents, have the power to implement pooled redundancy and redeployment schemes for workers in coal power stations and associated mines. This was referred to in a fact sheet in a media release from the then opposition leader in Labor's National Platform as Labor's uncosted economy-wide climate policy. Labor was making its intention to kill off coal jobs crystal clear. The document specifically listed the Bowen Basin as one of the target areas for their unbelievable hit on the coal sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In their climate policy Labor said they would spend $8½ million to establish pooled redundancy schemes for coal miners. How did we get to the point where the Labor Party, the so-called workers' party, wanted taxpayers' money to put people out of a job? We saw one Labor MP after another, including the then deputy leader and the then shadow environment minister use the Adani Carmichael coal project as their whipping boy, which was essentially smashing the coal sector. The member for Port Adelaide said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I do not support opening new mines in the Galilee Basin, whether it's by Adani, Clive Palmer or anyone else for that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Griffith has been openly against the mine and has been on the record as opposing the Adani Carmichael coal mine for over two years. In 2018, during the abatement by-election, in reference to the Adani project the member for Maribyrnong said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't support it because it doesn't add up commercially and environmentally…</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Sydney said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Oh, well it, it, it, it just, what it means is that the, the, the economic case for opening up the Galilee Basin isn't now what it was a decade ago.</span>

It means: $1.1 billion in wages; 17,974 full time jobs; $3.4 billion spent locally; 1,810 local businesses paid; and 261 community groups helped, and yet Labor just don't get it. Despite once claiming to be the proud party of the worker, Labor politician after Labor politician bagged the industry, bagged Adani, bagged the Galilee Basin and bagged thermal and metallurgical coalmines. They offered weasel words rather than reassurance to workers in our mining and construction industries, because they had to do deals in innercity seats to save their politicians.</span>

He even jumped in a photo for Facebook for me. Another union member turned up with his lifetime union membership card—CFMEU again. He also showed me an old wallet he was carrying. It had his mother and father's lifetime Labor Party membership in it. He said, 'Because of all this, for the first time in my life, probably in generations in my family, I will not be voting for the Labor Party; I'll be voting for you.'

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other issues that kept people in my electorate awake at night when they contemplated the prospect of a Shorten Labor government: the retiree tax, the housing tax, the electricity tax in the form of a new carbon emissions policy, weak borders, siding with the state Labor government in their attack on farmers through the tree-clearing legislation that was going to be taken federally, and the state Labor government's new so-called sustainability regulations on commercial fishermen. These are really the most unsustainable laws you could ever see. They reduce some commercial fishermen's catch by 80 per cent. That's not sustainability; that's a shutdown of an industry. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt that we've ever seen such an amazing array of bad laws, and Labor wanted to introduce more at the same time. It galvanised people into action. I had big attendances at a range of meetings that I held with groups that were very worried about their future, a future potentially under a Shorten Labor government. Truckies once again turned up in numbers concerned about the return of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Property developers and real estate agents gathered in my office and elsewhere. They were worried about the prospect of Labor's negative gearing policy. They saw it as a tax on the housing sector. Canefarmers, cattlemen and fishermen all gathered, battling the state Labor government, as I said, on the so-called sustainability reef laws and vegetation management laws—laws that Labor was talking about amplifying in the federal sphere. One businesswoman in Mackay, a financial planner who is about to retire, walked into my office one day and asked what she could do to help. She couldn't stand the thought of a Shorten Labor government. Many others of all ages and all walks of life stepped up to help in all sorts of ways, some putting in long hours. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look to the future, one thing that I am very much focused on is securing a regional deal for the Mackay Isaac Whitsunday region. This was my commitment to the people of Dawson ahead of the election, and I have been working with the region's mayors—Greg Williamson, Andrew Wilcox and Anne Baker—to put together the details of an agreed plan of transformational projects for our region. They are projects that will futureproof our region, projects that will actually ensure a continuation of profitability and sustainability in existing industries in our region. As we perhaps move towards more automation in mining, we want to see work on that done in our region, not in a capital city and certainly not in another country; we want to see it in our region. We have opportunities to diversify in our agricultural sector, to provide more profitability to farmers. We also see the ability to transform our region altogether into a new tourist sector, whether it be more land based tourism opportunities in the Whitsundays or making Mackay a destination in its own right rather than a gateway to the Whitsundays and the islands. These are things that I'm going to be pursuing in my real action as the member for Dawson.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Science and Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  It's a great privilege to rise in this chamber as a cabinet minister in the new Morrison government. Our focus was made clear at the first meeting of the ministry last year when the Prime Minister presented each of us with an Australian flag pin—a symbolic and significant reminder for us from day one that we were there to serve the Australian people. It's a focus that never wavered. That was clear during the campaign, and it's even clearer to us all today. We know that our role is to back the aspiration of Australians. That's our job. It's not our job to tell them what they should be doing, how they should be thinking, what car they should be driving or what cause they should support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom is what underpins individual aspiration, and economic prosperity is what underpins both freedom and aspiration. That's why a strong economy is central to our vision and our agenda. It's not something we take for granted; it's something we work towards every day not because of ideology but because we know that a strong economy delivers a better way of life, more opportunity and a chance to get ahead for the quiet, hardworking Australians who make this country great. That's why the economy matters. It's about people, not numbers or figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud to hold a broad and crucial economic portfolio: industry, science and technology. As an engineer by profession and having served as Assistant Minister for Science and Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, I came to this role with grounding in the essentials: science and practical skills. I'm also one of the many people on the side of the House who have run their own small business. Since I was elected in 2010, I've worked hard and diligently for my electorate of MacPherson on the southern Gold Coast and for the Australian people. I'm not a factional player. I don't seek the limelight. I believe good government is about results and working hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest. Over the past decade, there has been a culture of musical-chairs leadership and political games on both sides of politics. I love <span style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span> as much as the next person, but the instability and drama we've seen over the past decade are not what Australians want from their governments. It dismayed me as much as it dismayed everyone else. I'm pleased that those days are behind us. The Australian people voted in May this year for a new way of government under the leadership of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. They voted for stability, humility and sensible government that puts the Australian people first rather than those who walk the corridors of power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud to be an example of what can be achieved through quiet hard work and without self-promotion or quotas. It was recently pointed out to me that I'm the first woman ever from Queensland to sit at the federal cabinet table from either side of politics. Since Dame Annabelle Rankin became a minister 53 years ago in 1966, Queensland women have made a remarkable contribution to the parliament, but none have ever held a cabinet position. I'm proud to be the first of what I hope will be many more to come. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the confidence the Prime Minister has placed in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as our government works every day to repay the faith the Australian people put in us, I work every day to honour the responsibility I have as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. The first minister for industry was named in 1928. I'm also very proud to be the first female industry minister in the federal government. I come to the position not because of or in spite of my gender but as someone who has the skills, passion and experience to do the job. The portfolio I'm honoured to hold is central to Australia's economy. The course of our economy in the future is being imagined, chartered and forged through science and technology, and industry is the vehicle that will power along that course, utilising and maximising the paths that science and technology create.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are international forces challenging our domestic setting in new ways for government, businesses and workers in industries undergoing rapid change. Our government plans to drive all industries forward by getting the economic fundamentals right and by supporting businesses so they can be successful and globally competitive. Traditional sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, mining and aquaculture continue to support millions of Australian jobs, with so many in outer suburban and regional Australia. At the same time, there are incredible opportunities opening up in the fields of automation, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The influence of AI is growing and its potential cannot be overstated. Earlier this year, I released a discussion paper on the ethics of AI, as part of a consultative process. Our government recognises that, in order to realise the full potential of AI, it's important that Australians have trust in how it is being designed, developed and used by business and government. In my department we're making a concerted effort to link activity across government to meet industry needs and develop credible pathways to get people into jobs and to boost business. Last year alone, more than 425,000 businesses and organisations received advice and assistance through AusIndustry, and there were more than six million users of business.gov.au, our government's excellent online one-stop shop.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't take up time today listing all of the positive programs we're delivering, from accelerating commercialisation grants to the Entrepreneurs' Program and major projects funding, that deliver significant industry-building projects. They're all practical; they're all co-funding arrangements—no handouts. They're about making the process of growing businesses easier and more successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to mention the industry growth centres which our government introduced in 2015 for a four-year period. Last year we extended them for a further two years. Growth centres have been established in six industry sectors of competitive strength and strategic priority: advanced manufacturing; cybersecurity; food and agribusiness; medical technologies and pharmaceuticals; mining equipment, technology and services; and oil, gas and energy resources. Growth centres are not-for-profit organisations, each led by a strategic board of industry experts who oversee the operation. So far, they have kicked plenty of goals. Since they began, they've engaged with over 26,000 firms, research organisations and industry associations. They have delivered over 150 collaborative projects addressing sector-wide opportunities, with $57.9 million committed by the growth centres and $77.7 million leveraged from industry partners. They have conducted more than 450 skills workshops with over 10,000 participants and assisted in establishing 16 cooperative research centres to help businesses get an edge. They have coordinated a 'team Australia' presence that has supported over 900 Australian organisations at 40 international trade shows and outbound trade missions. This has resulted in at least 150 firms either securing their first export or expanding their sales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all ministers, my first order of business is delivering the election commitments we made. These include establishing a $50 million manufacturing modernisation fund, which will provide grants to small and medium sized manufacturing businesses to modernise, grow and employ more Australians, particularly helping those in regional and outer-suburban Australia. We will also reinvigorate the Australian Made campaign with up to $5 million to promote the logo in Australia's key export markets, to maximise the value of Australian goods. We will be expanding the incubator Support Initiative with an additional $5.2 million, specifically to assist migrants establish a start-up business, because we know it's the Australian way that if you have a go, you get a go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great personal joys for me in this portfolio is having oversight for the science agencies, including CSIRO, ANSTO, IP Australia, the National Measurement Institute and Questacon, all of which are active internationally. In the international science community Australia has always punched well above its weight. To support that, we're constantly working to better align these agencies with our strategic approach to international science engagement. Our government knows and recognises that science should not be shackled or clouded by ideology. It must be free of ideological pressures. Scientific inquiry must be rigorous, thorough and always open to new research and ideas. The very best science is solutions focused and designed to address challenges rather than just assess and present them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the government's exciting new agencies is the Australian Space Agency. I must confess that I am very fond of the title often bestowed on me by some in the media: the 'Minister for Space'. Of course, that is a very large and expansive portfolio. It is truly exciting to be spearheading our government's plan for Australia's space economy to triple the size of the space sector to $12 billion and create up to 20,000 new jobs by 2030. Our priorities for the space economy are set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advancing Space: Australian Civil Space Strategy 2019-28</span>, published earlier this year. In the April budget, we announced a new $19.5 million space infrastructure fund to be delivered over four years. Yesterday we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, and I was delighted to join with Australians from across the nation who came to Parkes for the official commemoration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly hope that the activities and media interest in space over the last month help inspire young people to study STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—which is also a focus of my work. Technology is undoubtedly the key to the productivity and competitiveness of Australian industry, and a skilled workforce is absolutely crucial. We know that the jobs of the future will be in STEM, so shaping a pro-technology agenda will be front and centre of our work over the coming term. Supporting the start-up sector, which is so often tech focused, is also part of our plan to make sure all business owners realise their aspirations. This leads me neatly back to our objective of backing the aspirations of the quiet Australians, as the Prime Minister articulated at that very first meeting and did so repeatedly during the election campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to take a moment to reflect on the election and, primarily, to thank the people of McPherson who placed their trust in me for a fourth time. I've always believed that my primary duty is to the people of the southern Gold Coast. That was my view when I was first elected in 2010 and it's still very much my approach today. I've spoken extensively in this place about our community, our business leaders, our outstanding education and health service providers, the volunteers who are the backbone of our sporting clubs, charities, veterans and community groups. I love the community that I've been part of for more than 20 years, where my husband, Chris, and I have raised our three daughters. There's no better place than the southern Gold Coast to raise your family, start a business, follow your aspiration or visit for a holiday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few minutes that I have left, it's fitting that I thank the many local residents who have come onboard to help me over the past nine years, particularly during the last election campaign—old friends and new, my LNP branch members. There are far too many of them to name them all, but I do thank them all—those people who were out there in the lead-up to the election on prepoll, who were booth captains, who were booth workers, who helped wherever they could, as often as they could and for as long as they could. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to mention my local LNP chairman, Ben Naday, who I have known for a very long time through the party. He has always been a tremendous supporter and has always had the southern Gold Coast and the LNP as the focus of his endeavours when making sure that we're fighting for a good deal on the Gold Coast. I'd also like to thank my treasurer, Boyd Hain, who I've also known and worked with for a very long period of time. He certainly keeps a tight rein and makes sure that we are maximising our opportunities on the southern Gold Coast. I'd also like to take a moment to thank the LNP team at our Queensland party headquarters, led by Lincoln Folo and Michael O'Dwyer. The result in Queensland speaks for itself—not only holding all our marginal seats but also winning the extra ones that got us across the line. To quote the Prime Minister, 'How good is Queensland?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the long hours and sacrifice put in by everyone at LNP headquarters, and I thank them. I know the same is true of those at our federal headquarters, which was based in Brisbane and led by Andrew Hirst and his team. I genuinely thank them all for the work they did, particularly over the campaign period. I'd also like to thank my staff, both in my electorate office and in my ministerial office, for the extra time and effort they put into the campaign, as well as their ongoing support and energy as we worked together to deliver the government's positive plan for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to my family. We are a small but very close and tightly knit family: my mum, Moya Weir; my sister, Ann; my husband, Chris; and our three daughters, Emma, Jane and Kate. Throughout my life I've had tremendous support from my parents. Sadly, my father passed away before I was elected to parliament, but I know how much he would have wanted to have remained part of the work I'm doing here in parliament and how supportive he and Mum have always been to my sister and to me. Mum and my sister, Ann, once again rolled up their sleeves, chipped in and did everything they could to support me during the election campaign. For me, that's just the icing on the cake, because I know how much they do for me on a daily basis. To my husband, Chris—and I recall that shortly after I was elected he was described by some of my branch members as my 'long-suffering husband'. Well, I disputed that at the time, but now, nine years into my time in parliament, I must confess that Chris is my long-suffering husband, because he has gone above and beyond in all of that time to support me very personally and to make sure that our children, Emma, Jane and Kate, were looked after in the time that I was not physically present on the Gold Coast and at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to Chris I say thank you very much. To my three daughters, Emma, Jane and Kate: all I can say is that life is not always easy for political children. My daughters had the luxury, I would call it—they would call it something else—of being driven to school in a car that had their mother's name and face on the outside of it. I didn't really understand what the impact of that was until at one stage we took the signage off the outside of the car and one of my daughters said, 'It's so good that now when we pull up at the traffic lights people aren't staring at us.' I thought, that is just so true, because when you're in a vehicle you forget what's on the outside of the car. To my daughters, who were driven to school in a car with their mother's face on the outside: I'm sorry, but thank you for all of that. Once again, they too rolled up their sleeves, and they were on pre-poll, they were out there on election day—they've campaigned for me from day one. They have been tremendous. They have understood the times that I have been unable to be there, and they've never ever thought I wasn't a good mother. So, thank you, girls; I really do appreciate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This 46th Parliament and the Morrison government represent a new chapter in Australian political history. It's a time to rebuild trust, deliver real outcomes and create an economy where all Australians can get ahead. I look forward to the challenges and to making my earnest contribution to this parliament and to the Morrison government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  I am deeply humbled to stand before you in this great place where I now commit again to be the servant and representative of the people of La Trobe, in the 46th Parliament, having been re-elected. This is actually my fifth term. The first time I was elected was back in 2004, when we had John Howard as Prime Minister, so I feel very honoured, being in a marginal seat, to again have the people of La Trobe supporting me. This time was interesting, because there had been the redistribution, and I thank very much those up in the Dandenong Ranges who have supported me in the past. Under the redistribution they're now in the Speaker's federal seat of Casey. The electorate of La Trobe now goes right to Pakenham and Nar Nar Goon. We've also lost Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully in those areas too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having lived in the south-east and grown up in Ferny Creek and Belgrave and up through the Dandenong Ranges, I very much feel a strong connection to the south-east of Melbourne. It's a great place to bring up a family. Sometimes we as members of parliament don't—or we forget to—acknowledge the contribution made by our family members. I thank my parents, Bob and Jan, for everything they've done for me. It was always hard for them. The first time, when I told my father, I said, 'The Liberal Party's asked me to be a candidate in Holt.' He looked me in the eye and he said he'd never been more disappointed in his entire life. He was a pretty hard-core Labor man! As we all know, sometimes your own political views are not necessarily those of your family. Having said that, my father and my mother have been great supporters, and at times they have had to carry the burden of the policies of the government of the day, the Liberal Party and also my own views. So I thank them very much. They both have been unwell, and my thoughts are always with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife, Judy, was born in Hong Kong, and we have a fantastic, beautiful daughter, Jasmine, now five years old. I thank my wife, Judy, for again being there every time I've asked her to come to a function, when she has her own business. As she points out to me sometimes, she's working two jobs! I've always called Jasmine my secret weapon. I don't know how many functions Jasmine has gone to in the last couple of years, but every time she goes to a function she brings joy and hope to the place. Sometimes she lets Daddy know it's a pretty boring function and it's time to go home! That's what I love about kids: they're brutally honest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my campaign team, who worked tirelessly for me as volunteers, ably led by Andrew McNabb, the FEC chair; and the branches and all the supporters I have. It is really touching, and I know this is for all members of parliament, when you have this incredible volunteer base out there supporting you day in, day out—not getting paid. They go out on weekends. They go to train stations and shopping centres all believing the cause. I have so many volunteers and I thank them very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a huge difference in this campaign in La Trobe. Again, it was one of those seats where the media, I say wrongly, said that we'd would lose La Trobe in the election. I know things were tougher down in Victoria compared to other states. My best wishes are always with Chris Crewther, the former member for Dunkley and Sarah Henderson, the former member for Corangamite, for giving it all and, sadly, losing their seats. I acknowledge the other members from all parties who are not here. The public wouldn't realise that when you lose your seat your staff lose their jobs and it's actually very tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big groups which really came on board supporting me in the recent federal election was the multicultural communities in La Trobe. It's something that we've seen in probably the last six or seven years. We've had so many migrant families move into the La Trobe area, especially from the Indian and Sri Lankan communities. I thank the Sri Lankan and Indian communities—and within the Indian the Sikh, the Gujarati, the Punjabi, the Bengali, the South Indian, the Tamil, the Telugu and the Malayali. The list goes on and I apologise for all the other community groups I haven't mentioned. The one thing I found with the Indian communities, and I suppose when it comes to Sri Lanka too, is that when it comes to cricket there's that mutual understanding and respect straightaway. I very much thank the Indian groups who play cricket with me on a Sunday morning. As I was going to field the ball they would always tell me what the government should be doing. I thank my friends in the Afghani community too, especially Ishaq for everything he has done for me. I thank the Pakistani community—and this is a growing community in La Trobe. I thank the guys who helped us out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An interesting one, and this caught the media a bit by surprise, was the strong support I had from the Sudanese and African communities. I put my hand up when we had issues with the African gangs. I was the one who said, 'There's an issue and we need to deal with that.' I very much thank Andrew Nyar, who is the South Sudanese leader in Pakenham, who I've worked very closely with and who has supported me in my campaign. What I'm trying to do locally once we've called out the issues is to do something about them. There's no future for any young person who's committing crimes, home invasions or carjackings. It's going to end up in tears every time for the victims but also for the young person. When they commit such a serious crime they will end up in jail for 10 years or get deported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the programs we introduced locally were through the Les Twentyman Foundation. Les is a great person from the western suburbs. Les appeared before our inquiry 'no-one taught me how to be an Australian'. I will say that that was a joint term agreed with the deputy, Maria Vamvakinou, to acknowledge the struggle within the South Sudanese community particularly—and that was by a gentleman by the name of Gum who was a youth worker with the Les Twentyman Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Les made the very strong point to me that if you want to make a difference in the communities who are doing it tough early intervention is the key. You have to get to the kids in schools with social workers, especially when someone has been in a country where they have seen the most horrific and horrendous crimes. It's like someone was telling me, in Sudan these young people have seen people butchered to death so they need much stronger support. Locally, through the Les Twentyman Foundation, we have seven highly skilled and trained youth workers in a number of schools, including in my local area of Pakenham and Berwick. I was with the vice-principal from Pakenham the other day, who in my office with the Les Twentyman Foundation. Manny, as they call him at the secondary college, was just saying how fantastic this has actually been at the Les Twentyman Foundation. That is something I'm very excited about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will talk about the Hope Australia Soccer Academy. I had Larry Sebastian approach me. I had a committee formed where, again, they were bringing in—they called it Hope Australia—Brazilian soccer players, who had come over and wanted to help those in the greatest of need. They were very keen to help the Sudanese. In particular, when I say 'soccer players', I don't mean people who have kicked a soccer ball in Brazil. Some of the players who I met were actually in the World Cup winning Brazilian soccer team. It was a two-week period of coming out to Australia and then going around the world. Larry said to me, 'Why don't we see if we can make this long term?' I really want to thank the Minister Paul Fletcher, because we ended up securing $1 million to make sure that happens. We have two FIFA-trained soccer coaches in Australia. Their key role, locally in the south-east, is to work with children in harm. One of the key groups is the Sudanese group. I was told just recently by one of the Sudanese elders that, if you go to the youth detention centres, nearly half the kids who are in there in Victoria are actually African.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say thank you again to the Muslim community. They have been very supportive. We work very closely together on various issues. We always do, and will continue to do so into the future. I am working with a Pakistani group locally who are just absolutely fantastic. I acknowledge the Indian Sikh community, the Gurdwara Siri Guru Nanak Darbar Officer and the Gurudwara Baba Budha Ji Pakenham. I acknowledge Harpreet and his team in Officer. When it comes to Pakenham, I very much want to thank Monty, his father, Suri<span style="font-weight:bold;">,</span> Jag, the president, the uncle and all of the guys down there. They were just incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the state election, a lot of these community groups made it very clear that they voted Labor. During the federal election, they decided to back me. It was more because they thought we were trying to do the best that we could for the local community. To me, it is something very special when people say, 'We're going to support you. We may have some concerns with policies, but we believe you're the person who can work with the local community.' That's something I'm very proud to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Indian Association Cardinia Casey. I thank the Cardinia Gujarati Association, and I'm going to mention Brijal there. I thank the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Melbourne, the Celebrate India organisation and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community group. As I mentioned before, Tariq and his great community are down there. I thank the Bangla Art Society of Victoria, the Cultural Society of Victoria, the Kerala community and Malayalees of Melbourne. I will say that the function was so moving at Bunjil Place after the flooding. What they're doing for their own community back home is something special. I thank the Sakyamuni Sambuddha Vihara Sri Lanka in Victoria, otherwise known as the Berwick Buddhist temple. I again thank all of the people down in that community there and especially those who introduced me to Ranj Perera, who is now actually on my staff and working with me as an advisor. I thank Sam from the community there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something really special happened during the campaign. The event was actually a planned event. It was straight after the awful attacks in Sri Lanka on the Easter weekend. We had the Prime Minister visiting on the Monday. I thank Dusha for all of her preparations and for having the beautiful Sri Lankan girls practising dance. The conversation was about whether we cancel the dancing and make it a more sombre event, but I had the very strong view that we never allow terrorists to win. Those beautiful little girls had been practising and singing, and it was great to have them perform in front of the Prime Minister and Mrs Morrison. I know that was one of the highlights of the Morrison family's visit to the amazing community after such a horrendous attack. There was the Afghan Australian Association of Victoria, the Coptic Christian Egyptians in Pakenham and, as I mentioned before, the Hope Australia Soccer Academy and the Buddhist Council of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a very vibrant and multicultural community. We are home to the world's oldest continuous culture as well as Australians who identify with more than 270 ancestries. Since 1945, almost seven million people migrated to Australia. One of the things I found in the migrant community when I first dealt with the Buddhist Vihara in Berrick is how important their native language is. I find there's nothing worse when you meet parents who were born overseas and, when you say, 'Can your children speak the language from back home?' they say, 'No. At home we always make sure we speak English.' They kind of regret it. My little Jasmine at home speaks Cantonese and Mandarin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Prime Minister Scott Morrison for making $780,000 available to support a meditation and education facility at the Buddhist temple for children to learn. The same occurred in the Gurudwara in Pakenham and Officer. Money was made available, again so they would have the funds to ensure their children would be able to learn Punjabi. This is the sort of project, in my role as assistant minister, that I think is so vital and needs to be rolled out further across the country. We supported the Sikh Games with $120,000. Next year, in WA there will be another Sikh Games, with $300,000. Coming up on the AFL grand final weekend, they have games in Pakenham. As I just said to the guys, in some ways I hope Richmond doesn't make the grand final, because it will put a lot of pressure on to turn up for that event! Also, locally we have Bunjil Place, a $110 million facility. If anyone listening gets the opportunity, go down to Fountain Gate to see Bunjil Place. It won international arts awards last year. The work they have done is absolutely incredible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A future multicultural project I'm working on is a multicultural hub design in Pakenham, with $350,000. It is to speak to migrant people and find out what is important to them and what is missing. One thing I definitely heard in my electorate, and I've realised this from the multicultural communities in particular, is that they may have 500, 600 or 700 people at a family and community function. The wider community is family. It is also about dealing with the issues of trying to find jobs and having sporting facilities in place for the seniors and the juniors, but not necessarily the traditional cricket, football and netball. There are the sports they have mentioned to me, like badminton, table tennis and other activities. This is something I want to work on with the local community to make sure we actually deliver, and I'm very excited about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, the Living and Learning centre in Pakenham was funded $180,000. The aim of the project is to address the challenges and break down some of the barriers facing the South Sudanese community in Cardinia, to foster better general relationships with authorities and youth focus groups, and to have a Sudanese warden program and legal aid sessions. There is also $322,000 for the Women's Association South East Melbourne Australia. This grant will be used to establish new Women's Friendship Circles. The WFC project has been developed to meet the needs of the rapidly changing neighbourhoods of the south-east community. Another a project I'm very excited about is in Cardinia Shire. I was able to secure $105,000 for them to employ a full-time Sudanese youth liaison officer. I thank the Bangladesh community for the Dream Harmony project—$65,000—which will bring music into the area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise to inform the House of the death of Ron Monaghan, better known to Queenslanders as Mono, who died on Sunday, 30 June 2019. Mono was the much loved former branch secretary of the Queensland branch of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, or 'the Missos', as we always called them, now known as United Voice. He was also the former Queensland Council of Unions general secretary and former president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mono fought for decent wages and better conditions for more than 2.2 million Queensland workers. He started in the union movement in New South Wales in 1979, before he saw the light and moved to Queensland 10 years later. Queensland has rarely seen such a passionate and effective warrior for working people as Ron Monaghan. Ron was a man who loved his family, and he treated the Queensland Labor movement as part of that family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ron fought his last battle courageously and is survived by his wife, Vicki, their eight children and four grandchildren. When I visited Mono in hospital shortly before he passed away, he was so proud to show me his big family photo and talk to me about all of the things that were happening with his grandkids and kids. He'll always be remembered for his generosity of spirit, his tenacity in pursuing what was right and the leaps and bounds he made for working people. These leaps and bounds were not only in their standards of living but in the respect that he knew they deserved—in our hearts and minds and at the forefront of everything we do in this great movement.</span>

I obtained a grant of nearly $750,000 to upgrade this facility. Far North Coast Hockey, the Lismore council and private donors made up the balance of this $1.6 million project. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment is already now bringing much more into our community. In the last 12 months alone there have been six major events at the facility, including the Men's Masters Australian Hockey Championships. These tournaments have brought approximately 1,800 players and supporters to the Northern Rivers in the last 12 months, bringing literally millions of dollars. It's a fantastic outcome for all the motels and other businesses in our region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were several players from the recent under-21 tournament that I would like to acknowledge. Tom Brown and Reece Gaddes played in the New South Wales team that was ranked first, winning the gold medal. Cooper Stahl played and captained the New South Wales Blues team. Grace Young played in the women's team. Taquira McGrath and Erin Lidbetter competed in the women's New South Wales Blues team, and Luca Brown and Tyler Arundell both competed for the Queensland state team. I congratulate Paul Leadbeatter, who was the chairman of the organising committee, and his team of Christine Goderall, Jenny Pearson, Jan Hutton, Wendy Trudgeon and Clint Mallett. I'd also like to acknowledge the Lismore Workers Club, who sponsored the entire New South Wales hockey squad for the event.</span>

It's a great privilege to serve our community in this place. It's something I will never take for granted. I've spent the last three years working for the people of Wills, listening to people, talking to people across the community and helping people. My constituents care. They care about a society having the chance to succeed and thrive. They care about quality schools, quality health care, good jobs and fair wages. They care about the importance of Australia taking real action on climate change and being part of the international solution to that crisis. They want everyone in our community, no matter a person's gender, religion, culture or ethnicity, being welcomed as equals. It's about embracing our differences and diversity as a strength of who we are and not allowing fear to divide us. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  What I'd like to talk about today is that we need regional representation in the Senate. It is beyond a joke now that we have 11 out of 12 senators in Western Australia coming from the city of Perth, 11 out of 12 from South Australia coming from Adelaide, 11 out of 12 in Victoria coming from Melbourne, 11 out of 12 in New South Wales coming from Sydney and Wollongong, and nine out of 12 in Queensland coming from Brisbane. There is now an even greater proportion of representation of major capitals by senators than by members of the House of Representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that is a segue into this debate, of course, is the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the proposed voice to parliament. I'm going to make sure I continue my discussions with senior Indigenous leaders so that not only do we have a voice to parliament but we have a voice in parliament, and senators can do precisely that. If we have six regions per state with two senators per region, with one half of the regions going up at one election and the other half going up at the next election, you can bet your life that from the Kimberley will come Indigenous senators, from the cape will come Indigenous senators and from western districts in New South Wales and Queensland will come Indigenous senators, and not only Indigenous senators but people whose political existence relies on them being able to understand Indigenous issues. I believe this is one of the pressing issues before our nation at the current time.</span>

But what do we have? Do we have that? Do we have policies? No. Are we dealing this week with the legislation to act on the banking royal commission's recommendations? No. Are we dealing with the payday lenders legislation? No. Are we dealing with action to increase wages? No. Are we dealing with ways to address homelessness in our suburbs? No. Are we dealing with underemployment and casualisation? No. All we've got from this government is slogans. 'The best form of welfare is a job,' they say. 'If you have a go, you get a go,' they say. Well, from this side of the House to that side of the House: get up and have a go yourselves before you tell the rest of Australia what to do. In Victoria, the state government is driving infrastructure funding and big building is driving jobs growth, not this federal government. In six years, they have left all of the heavy lifting to a state Labor government. What we're getting from this government is cliche after cliche. When those opposite have a go at being a responsible government, those on this side will give them a go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Australia's tourism sector provides an invaluable element of strength to our nation, and we here all have an obligation to protect it and to promote it. Therefore, we should all call out the recent misleading statement made by David Attenborough when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will never forget diving on the [Great Barrier] reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms of life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it seems David Attenborough has forgotten that four years he actually filmed a documentary which was promoted with a description of the reef as 'the perfect coral reef'. He filmed the Great Barrier Reef in all of its magnificent glory. Promoting this documentary in 2015, he described the reef as 'fantastic. He said it was 'breathtaking, a dream'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These misleading statements made by Attenborough not only harm the reef; they harm Australian tourism. Already Cathay Pacific have announced they are pulling out of Cairns citing lack of demand. No-one denies that parts of the reef are damaged from time to time by cyclones and bleaching. The science tells us this has been happening for hundreds of years. Today the reef is in good shape and a great place to visit, and we should all proudly say so. It's time that men like Attenborough apologise for their misleading statements that harm Australian jobs.</span>

The shed received funding from multiple partnerships. I want to thank the Hume City Council. I also want to thank Josh Bull, the state member for Sunbury, with assistance from the Victorian Labor government and, of course, the federal government, for making this long-sought upgrade possible. The Tullamarine Men's Shed is a hub for local men to share ideas and skills with each other to build and contribute to community related projects. The men's shed is also vital for bringing together men who may have experienced difficult circumstances to allow them to engage socially in a safe space.</span>

It's a fantastic facility and a benchmark for building stronger community cohesion in the years to come. I want to thank Cheryl Hildebrandt, the manager of the Tullamarine Community House and Tullamarine Men's Shed; Robert Stephenson, the president of the men's shed advisory group; and their team for their hard work in ensuring that the Tullamarine Men's Shed received these essential upgrades. I congratulate them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise to support 400-metre swimmer Mack Horton, who declined the Guangzhou podium yesterday in a landmark gesture of defiance and a call for clean, fair sport. This has nothing to do with nationalism. This is related to the facts on the table. While it is technically before the courts due to FINA's long delays in resolving it, the reality is clear: one swimmer, already banned and serving a three-month secret suspension, on 4 September last year refused to submit to a test and, in the presence of his mother, a doctor and a guard, smashed his blood vials with a hammer when he was advised not to by the Swedish tribunal members by phone. This is all before the courts, but what has been denied is a great athlete's chance to stand on the podium in his career because someone has refused to submit a blood sample and has tampered with a blood sample. These details are irrevocable. My message to Mack Horton is: you are our world champion in waiting. Justice delayed is justice denied. You have support from every corner of the world in your stand, and, however it is resolved, like the many Australians before you denied their greatest moment by those who haven't played by the rules, our thoughts are with you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Back in March, the Greens called on governments to step in and organise the urgent removal of flammable cladding from all high-risk buildings, to ban its importation and to implement a levy on developments to recoup the costs in solving this crisis. This call followed disastrous fires in Melbourne at the Lacrosse and Neo 200 buildings and conversations with affected residents in my electorate. The Greens have been working closely with the community to push for change, refusing to accept that the government has no responsibility to help people who are living in unsafe apartments. Last week, we welcomed the Victorian government's decision to adopt Greens policy to fund the rectification of buildings with flammable cladding—the first step in dealing with this colossal failure of privatisation and poor regulation. This result is a testament to the hard work of the local community, but this rectification work needs to begin immediately in Victoria and across the country as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxpayers shouldn't be the only ones funding this. Once this cladding is removed, the government should pursue those companies who were responsible in court and implement a levy, if need be. While I am pleased that Premier Daniel Andrews has not ruled out investing more than $600 million, I am appalled that the federal government has refused to contribute just weeks after passing $158 billion in tax cuts. You have responsibility, Prime Minister, because the federal government let this flammable cladding into the country. This is a national issue and requires a national response. I know there'll be relief for many Victorians, but there's still plenty of work to do until everyone in Australia is safe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I rise to congratulate Emanuel Cohavi for representing Australia in the 56th International Bible Quiz in Israel. I've known Emmanuel for about five years. He's a student at Kesser Torah College. He often leads services at the Parramatta synagogue, where his father is the rabbi. The International Bible Quiz is an event that brings students together from across the world to compete on their knowledge of the Hebrew Bible. The quiz is part of the International Bible Camp, which takes participants around Israel to make the Bible come alive. They learn about Israel's history, enjoy Israel's beautiful landscape and meet intellectuals and officials from all around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian contestants are selected from the national Bible quiz run by the Zionist Federation of Australia. Students study for months before attending the International Bible Camp where they continue to study and prepare in the days leading up to the quiz held on Israel's Independence Day. There's a final test prior to the quiz in which the top representatives from each participating country compete against their fellow countrymen and women to narrow down participants to 16 finalists. Just four representatives from Israel and 12 from around the world compete in the final Bible quiz. Emanuel finished ninth in the world competition where he faced competitors from Canada, South Africa, Mexico, the US and Argentina.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quiz was started over 15 years ago as a highlight of Yom Ha'atzmaut, Israel's Independence Day. The quiz is televised live, and winners attract scholarships to the top universities in Israel. Kol Hakavod, Emanuel, on all your achievements in representing Australia in the International Bible Quiz.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  The Reserve Bank of Australia recently met in Darwin for the first time in 51 years and they had a clear message for those opposite, for the coalition federal government, and that is that in order to create jobs and keep growing the economy they must invest in key infrastructure. Well, when it comes to key infrastructure, you can't get any more key than the strategic ship lift asset for Australia's northern port that is Darwin Harbour. Darwin's location is of strategic importance. We're at the doorstep of the world's busiest shipping corridors, and we have the only functional deepwater port in northern Australia. This is why we need the federal government to come to the table and invest in a ship lift for Darwin, as the Northern Territory government has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it needed? Some of Darwin's current ship lift infrastructure is not big enough for the new naval Offshore Patrol Vessels, so obviously it's not going to be able to do the job. We've got another ship lift that also doesn't satisfy Defence's needs, so we need this facility in Darwin. I've spoken with the Treasurer and had constructive conversations with him about it. But I say to the House that Darwin's strategic importance means that a ship lift for Darwin is not only in the Northern Territory's interest or Darwin's interest; it is absolutely one hundred per cent in the national interest.</span>

As the tide starts to go out on the Australian economy, it's not a pretty look for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. At the heart of the problems with the Australian economy is lacklustre wage growth, which is running now at half the level it was before the global financial crisis. Productivity in Australia has been, according to the Productivity Commission, 'mediocre'. That's because the government is failing to put in place essential investments in education and in infrastructure. We're also seeing a falling back in demand which means that our employment rate is a full percentage point higher than Britain, New Zealand, the United States or Germany. The government needs to bring forward infrastructure projects to ensure that we support demand right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the ACT, they could give the ACT our fair share of infrastructure funding by supporting stage 2 of light rail. Across the country, they need to stop funding projects out into the never-never, in the mid-2020s, and start ensuring that infrastructure spending flows now—to give the economy the support it needs, to ensure that we get a lower unemployment rate and to ensure that workers start to get a pay rise. We've got wage theft going on, from celebrity chefs to 7-Eleven, but we also have outright wage theft going on from a government that has only slogans and no plan to support the Australian economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  A bunch of serial offenders, the extreme green protesters who call themselves the Extinction Rebellion, are going the right way about causing their own extinction with their continual disruption of people in the Brisbane CBD. They were at it again this morning under a different name, blocking the entrance to a concrete business which is trying to get some urgent work to a nursing home. And I understand we've got some other protestors, including foreigners—yes, foreign interference in Australian politics—up at Abbott Point, near Bowen, who have been arrested for obstructing access to the coal terminal. These green grandstanders have a range of silly and dangerous tricks to cause disruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than telling the people of Brisbane to leave their cars at home so these fruitcakes can waste everyone's time, the Queensland Labor government needs to enable its law enforcement officers and the courts to take stronger action to stop the rot. Regardless of what names they want to call themselves, these groups are filled with the same sense of misguided moral superiority. When Bob Brown and his crew decided to come and tell the people of Central and North Queensland what jobs we can have, what industries we can work in and what companies we can support, people sent their own message right back at them. But the green extremists still don't get it. I call on the Queensland Labor government to take tougher action to aid the re-education of all of these ecoterrorists that are filling our streets, blocking the access of law-abiding citizens to businesses and to their work, holding up work in Central Queensland and North Queensland—it's an absolute disgrace that it's allowed to go on without immediate police action.</span>

They've gone through all of the memorials in my area and a bit of Ryan as well—the Keating Park Memorial, the Graceville War Memorial, Bannerman Park in Oxley and other memorials and churches and the like that have honour boards. I want to acknowledge the great work of Jim Gibson, Ian Lang, David Dalziel, John Pearn, Peter Crossman and Ron Ausman; all of the mentoring teachers in the participating schools—I won't have time to mention them all; the student researchers, who did the hard work; Marian Mackenzie from the Oxley-Chelmer History Group; Brian Wade; and so many other people that have brought this story to light so that everyone can access this great resource.</span>

One of those times is near, as South East Queensland seeks to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Now this should be right in our sweet spot, because as a country we are highly internationalised. We are welcoming. We are multicultural. We are a safe and secure country, and we have a demonstrable track record when it comes to running major events. What's more, when you're talking about the Gold Coast and Brisbane, though to the Sunny Coast, we are a mecca for tourism. We have the opportunity right now to take first-mover advantage to host the 2032 Olympic Games. The federal government is on board. The South East Queensland Council of Mayors is on board. The Australian Olympic Committee is on board. That just leaves one outstanding to date, and that is the Queensland state government. We need them on board. We need them to get together with the locals, with the feds and with the AOC, because only with a united effort can we win the chance to host the 2032 Olympic Games.</span>

His Eminence is now the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia, and it was a joyous occasion, although it follows the sad passing of Archbishop Stylianos earlier in the year.</span>

His Eminence spoke of his main wish: to break down barriers between faiths, to spread love without discriminating and to mentor young Australians. He was clear also about the importance of young people and their relationship with the church.</span>

I am proud to represent an electorate that has a very vibrant Greek Orthodox community. Kingsford Smith is home to the St Spyridon and St Katherine parishes, which do a great job educating young Australians.</span>

It is managed by the Gladstone Ports Corporation, formerly the Gladstone Port Authority, a statutory corporate body of the Queensland government. Major exports include coal and gas, aluminium and cement products. GPC had its biggest year ever in exports in 2018-19, with a record 124.8 million tonnes of trade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes on the back of revelations that the Crime and Corruption Commission in the Queensland government is assessing allegations of corrupt conduct in the GPC. Chairman Leo Zussino was stood down. In May, the GPC board sacked CEO Peter O'Sullivan following an investigation into the handling of a staff disciplinary matter. He was on full pay of $533,000 a year while he was under suspension. Port handling fees are the dearest in Queensland. As exports continue to grow, it is vital that the state government start operating the port with full transparency.</span>

Minister after minister, the Prime Minister's office and ministers' offices have kicked the ball around for far too long. A few weeks ago I was dumbfounded to learn that blood testing for those impacted by PFAS has ended. If you don't know what it is, google it. Do yourselves a favour and learn more about this contaminant. It's not going away. It is right across Australia. We need a policy for it, and you have done absolutely nothing. You've taken away blood tests from my community.</span>

The government have taken away blood tests. Did they let people know even by a letter or an email? No, a benign ad in a local paper was the only way that my community found out about this. They failed to take any sort of policy to the last election. In fact, their candidate didn't even show up to the community forum for all of us who were asking to represent our community. I don't blame that candidate, because they were just told to roll up in a ball by the powers up the chain. They can't come up with a policy. They can't come up with anything decent. It's been kicked from Defence to Health and Environment, and it's not good enough. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Locally, in forest regions like that of my home town in the Green Triangle, there's an innate sense of how important the forest industry is, which is why I was thrilled to hear that Timberlink is investing in the region again. The company is investing $90 million over the next three years in upgrading its mill at Tarpeena and will increase both the volume of the renewable plantation pine logs process and the yield per log. This is fantastic news for the region in the long term, helping to ensure the mill remains internationally competitive. Currently, the mill supports over 680 jobs directly and many more indirectly and contributes over $180 million to the local economy. This investment will help create and secure an addition 210 permanent full-time positions.</span>

Today I rise to recognise the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's historic trip to the moon and to honour all who made it possible, including the many Australians who were part of that amazing achievement. Fifty years ago it was said that the heavens became part of man's world, and for one priceless moment all the people of this world were truly one. The achievement of that day lives through the ages. We should never cease to marvel at that achievement nor take it for granted, nor the nation that enabled us to achieve it. The Apollo missions were missions of unparalleled risk and opportunity. As President Kennedy said at Rice University in 1962—and we could almost all say it together—'We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard. That goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills.' And that's indeed what it did, inspiring generations to follow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to send a person to the moon ultimately involved the efforts and toil of 400,000 men and women for almost a decade. I'm sure many members and many outside of this place have taken the opportunity to watch many of the documentaries that have been airing and to marvel again at the tremendous stories. I took that opportunity with my kids over the weekend. These 400,000 men and women included 700 Australians. Every part of their effort was vital. Every challenge was interconnected with every other part of their mission. Nothing could be left undone, because the consequences of failure were too great. All who worked on the Apollo program carried the burden of Apollo 1, when astronauts Virgil Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee were incinerated in the command module. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's involvement in the Apollo missions was through our tracking facilities. NASA located these stations around the world at equidistant points in California, Spain and Australia. Communications to the Apollo missions depended on these tracking stations. As <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> wrote of the stations at Honeysuckle and Tidbinbilla, 'the road to the moon leads through Tharwa', and it did. The tracking stations formed part of the electromagnetic umbilical cord through which information travelled 186,000 miles per second. In the words of historian and author Andrew Tink, who I understand is in the building today, 'Without the tracking stations, mission control would have been deaf, dumb and blind to astronauts on the moon, and vice versa.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the leadership of Tom Reid, who as many Canberrans would know is the late husband of former senator Margaret Reid, Honeysuckle, Tidbinbilla and Parkes all played their part in a remarkable moment for humanity. It is a remarkable thing that we rarely say that Americans went to the moon, though that is a statement of obvious fact. Rather, to us it wasn't just Americans who went to the moon; it was humankind that went to the moon. That's because the United States, through its actions, embodied the best of us and all of us. Buzz Aldrin said, 'The Apollo missions stand as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown.' They remind us that through united, concerted and unrelenting effort we can meet the challenges of our age: cancer, disease, water, climate, race—all things that challenge us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifty years ago our Prime Minister, along with others, was asked to write a message which was inscribed on a disc that was left on the moon's surface. John Gorton wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a dramatic fulfilment of man's urge to go 'always a little further'. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">May the high courage and the technical genius which made this achievement possible be so used in the future that mankind will live in a universe in which peace, self-expression and the chance of dangerous adventure are available to all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  I join with the Prime Minister in commemorating the 50th anniversary of this quite remarkable event. The voyage to the moon, and that one small step, began with a visionary president dedicating himself and his nation to doing the hard things. John F. Kennedy of course didn't live to see this dream made real, but, knowing the United States as he did, he would have had every confidence that the hard things would indeed be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins did anything but choose the easy path. They let themselves be strapped into a tiny capsule on top of what, if all went according to plan, amounted to a prolonged explosion that would hurl them free of our planet's atmosphere and then its gravity. To say that this required courage is quite an understatement. The technology had advanced in the seven years since John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, went to the launch pad with this thought:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I felt about as good as anybody would, sitting in a capsule on top of a rocket that were both built by the lowest bidder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the risks were indeed huge. Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins knew them all, but off they went. They were proud Americans, carrying the stars and stripes to another world, but they went for all of humanity. They were the human race reaching out, the human race following our endless hunger to explore, to discover, to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems somehow fitting that Armstrong and Aldrin landed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Eagle</span> with only 30 seconds of fuel to spare. To think how disconcerting it feels when the fuel warning light comes on in your car when you're still on the highway might give you some perspective on that! Eventually, Armstrong's words came back across the void:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words and that footage first touched down in Australia, landing on a dish at Honeysuckle Creek, just up the road from here. Tidbinbilla and Parkes played crucial roles as well. Here on the opposite side of the world to Houston, Australia was perfectly placed to be the eyes and ears for America and ultimately the world. Australia certainly played our part, and we are proud of it—and rightly so. I note that the Deputy Prime Minister is particularly proud of the role his electorate played, as he should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right across Australia that day 50 years ago, people crowded around black-and-white televisions in living rooms, schools and shops. I remember—it's probably my first memory of watching anything on TV—being with the nuns at St Joseph's, Camperdown. Obviously we didn't have a TV in the school. We were in the nunnery, next to the school, watching it play out live. As a nation, we held our breath—first as they landed and then as we wondered whether they'd successfully take off and get home. As Armstrong uttered one of the most famous sentences in history, one person who did not hear it was Collins. While planet earth heard about that giant leap, Collins was alone in the orbiter, passing through the shadow on the far side of the moon, cut off from all communications, drinking coffee, in the most perfect peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Collins self-caffeinated among the stars and Armstrong and Aldrin lay their boots on untrodden dust, they knew they'd been put there by the work of 400,000 people: engineers, scientists, mathematicians, doctors, cooks, cleaners, builders—you name it—brought together by a government of courage and vision and a nation united in the fulfilment of a vision, the realisation of a dream they'd all come to share. Up there, surrounded by what Aldrin later described as 'magnificent desolation', they all lifted their gaze above the eerily small lunar horizon and looked back at what mattered most—planet earth, a blaze of colour in the black sky, beautiful, fragile and the heart of all we are. Fifty years ago, three of America's finest made that planet feel bigger for all of us. It was a time of wonder and excitement. What had once seemed impossible had been achieved. The last word should go to the first man. Many years later, Neil Armstrong reviewed the moon as a destination and he said this: 'It's an interesting place to be. I recommend it.'</span>

The joint standing committee on these matters does important work in this parliament, and, when members come to that committee, they bring forward the positions of their various parties to address the national security issues the country faces. What I have noted in my time in this place is that it has always been those who sit on this side of the House who have brought the stronger position. It is always those who sit on this side of the House with the measures that we've brought before that committee. The matters have been sought to be watered down. Therefore it is always going to be the action of my government to ensure that, where those matters are watered down, we will always seek to remedy it—</span>

They opposed it in the last parliament. We put it in the budget. We took it to the Australian people. The Australian people returned the government to government to ensure that we could get on with the job of supporting our farmers through one of the toughest droughts that this country has ever seen. This government has delivered some $7 billion worth of support to our farmers and our rural communities all around the country. Most recently that has included more than $110 million—</span>

                  </a>  The point I'm making is that the government has been acting each and every day on the issue of supporting rural communities in relation to the drought, whether it's been the immediate assistance that has been required to support communities, through the million dollar payments to each of the shires and councils around the country, or whether it has been to invest in the water infrastructure projects which build resilience. We are investing in those projects right now, and the Future Drought Fund will enable us to continue to invest in those drought resilience projects into the future. We are funding those drought resilience projects right now out of the budget, and from 1 July next year we will be drawing down $100 million out of a fund that will increase in value to $5 billion and provide permanent funding support for drought resilience projects in this country. So I have a simple question to put to those opposite: why won't you support farmers going through the drought? How on earth can the Leader of the Opposition—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:16</span>):  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and I commend her on her maiden speech to the parliament today and to all her family and other supporters who are joining us in the parliament. The government is getting on with the job, as we were elected to do, to secure Australia's future, to keep our economy strong, to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, to keep Australians safe and to continue to bring Australians together to face the challenges that are ahead of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were last here, we passed into law—with no great assistance from those opposite—tax relief for millions of Australians, including 77,000 Australians living in the electorate of Lindsay who now have access to that legislated tax relief which the opposition leader was seeking to oppose right to the last moment, with 3.5 million Australians benefitting from that tax relief straightaway. On top of that, some 14,383 small businesses and family businesses in the electorate of Lindsay are also benefitting from the tax relief we are providing to those businesses. These policies, which enable people to keep more of what they own—something that is opposed by the Leader of the Opposition—are contributing to some of the strongest employment growth figures we have seen, at 2.6 per cent. There are 296,000 jobs that have been created in the last 12 months. Eighty per cent of those are full-time. That is the strongest full-time jobs growth we have seen in 12 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $100 billion being spent on infrastructure into the future, and I note that it's $25 billion more on infrastructure than was announced prior to last year's budget, when we first announced the Future Drought Fund. So there is $25 billion more going into infrastructure—which is more than six times the amount that Labor is trying to prevent us from putting into future drought resilience projects—that we are already spending on infrastructure. The congestion-busting components of that are going to relieve the congestion in our major metropolitan areas, particularly in the electorate of Lindsay, with $63 million for the Dunheved Road project, which is all about ensuring that Australians can get home sooner, they can get to work safer, and they can spend more time with their families as a result of those infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're building our relationships with the region, with our closest neighbours—and we welcome the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea here today, Prime Minister Marape. But it's not only here directly in our region; our work through the G20 and more broadly through the Indo-Pacific is setting up trading, economic and security opportunities all around the world. And we're keeping Australians safe. The temporary exclusion orders for those returning foreign fighters coming to Australia are needed to ensure that we can keep a close eye on those. That legislation should pass this parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One small step for man! Yesterday, it was one giant leap forward for Parkes, which is going to play such a an integral part in the inland rail—a $9.3 billion investment by this government because we get on and we do things. The fact is the inland rail was first suggested in 1890. The first plans were drawn up in the early 1900s, and the Liberals and Nationals are actually building it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But more to the point of the shadow minister's question, 19 out of 21 projects on the Infrastructure Priority List are funded by the Australian government. Nineteen out of 21—that's not a bad result. This government has significantly transformed the way we invest in infrastructure. We have a $100 billion commitment, a $100 billion investment, in infrastructure right across the country—better roads, better rail, better airports, better seaports. We are getting on with the job of building the infrastructure to, as the Prime Minister said, get Australians home sooner and safer.</span>

I think they thought they were going to be on this side of the House, but this side of the House is actually getting on with the job in our third term, just like we did in our second term and just like we did in our first term of building our future. Building our future—that's what we are doing. The increase in investment has been driven through annual appropriations. We are getting on with the job. You heard the Prime Minister in an earlier answer today talk about the additional $25 billion in our last budget, and this is what you can do—and this is what we will continue to do—when you've got a budget going into surplus. We see the New South Wales coalition government—the Liberals and Nationals in that state—getting on with a $94 billion rollout of infrastructure across four years. That's what you can do when you're in surplus.</span>

We are getting on with the job of putting our economic management into surplus, putting our budget into surplus. It's something they could only have a pipedream about. And when we talk of pipedreams and pipelines, we have a pipeline of investment—$100 billion over the next 10 years—and we're getting on with the job. It's creating jobs. What side do those on that side sit on? Do they agree with us? Do they want to get on with getting their people—their constituents—home sooner and safer or do they want to continually object and oppose everything?</span>

And in the electorate of Robertson over 16,000 small businesses will be able to access the instant asset write-off, which has been extended to $30,000 and to companies with a turnover of up to $50 million. So those constituents in Robertson, from Gosford and Terrigal to Woy Woy, will all benefit as a result of the tax package passed in this parliament. And I can also inform the House that, as of this morning, 2.9 million Australian taxpayers have put in a tax return for the 2018-19 year. That's more than 460,000 more than at the same time last year. And the Australian tax office has seen refunds already delivered to Australians of more than $3 billion. This is money finding its way into the economy to be spent at a cafe, on a plumber or an electrician, in retail or in other areas, as Australians see fit. It's part of the tax package that we passed through this parliament, which will ensure that 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers pay a marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know that those opposite have taken every position under the sun when it comes to tax cuts in this place. First, they were against them. Then they wanted to amend them. Then the Leader of the Opposition wanted to amend the title of the legislation—the great mover, the Leader of the Opposition. Then we had Senator Gallagher say, 'We can't have a position on it until we know what the crossbenchers think.' Then the Labor Party said they supported the tax cuts. And then, when the dust had settled, the best position was that the Labor Party blamed us for stopping our own tax cuts. They had every position under the sun.

Finally, we've seen the member for Hunter crawl out from under that rock that he's been hiding under for six years. He wasn't game enough to ask me a question—not one question did I get—in the last parliament about the drought or anything else. We've made a commitment to those who have been impacted by drought. To politicise the misery of Australian farmers is nothing short of the lowest political act that I saw in the last parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We put in place a systematic way to address it, to listen to communities at the grassroots, not only with the drought envoy but with Major General Day, who finished up on 30 June. We sat around kitchen tables and we sat in sheds listening to farmers and to communities, because it's not just farmers who hurt; it's also the communities that support them. That's why we're putting in place $1.9 billion of support in the here and now for a future fund—a future fund that those opposite voted against before the last election to politicise the misery of Australian farmers by trying to score a cheap political point.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in this country want leadership. They don't want politics. You are playing with the lives of Australian farming families. This is above politics. This is something that we can do better as a parliament. Get behind this today and support us to have a strategic policy backed by a centrepiece $5 billion future fund, which goes on to support Australian farming families, not just in the here and now that can be taken away at the whim of a Treasurer but legislated and protected, to make sure we make that commitment for longevity to ensure that those regional communities are supported. It's as simple as that. The question now comes to those opposite: who do you support?</span>

Now it's time to get on with the job, and that's why the Prime Minister appointed me and elevated drought to cabinet for the first time in our nation's history. We had a Prime Minister who in the first couple of days of his prime ministership came to a drought-affected community. He has elevated drought to the highest table of this office. That's leadership; that's not politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Health. Minister, I discussed with you recently the finding by respected health analyst Martyn Goddard that, since 2014, the Tasmanian government has failed to spend on health some $1.6 billion of GST funding earmarked for health. This is obviously no small matter in light of the systemic public health crisis being experienced in Tasmania, nor is it disputed, as a recent AAP FactCheck confirmed that the Tasmanian government has indeed misspent $1.6 billion of federal health funding. Minister, will you hold the Tasmanian government to account for this deadly dereliction of its core responsibility to provide effective health services, and what safeguards will you put in place to prevent this misconduct in the future?</span>

We did meet in the last sitting and we have looked very carefully at these matters. Whilst I respect the passion and the focus of the member for Clark, I respectfully disagree on the premise of his question. In fact, on investigation, what I have confirmed is that the Tasmanian government spend on health as a proportion of its budget has increased from 25 per cent to 32 per cent. This makes it one of the highest levels of health expenditure as a proportion of a state budget across the Commonwealth of Australia. But it comes as part of a broader partnership between the Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania, which the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and I have been able to develop. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania received health funding from the Commonwealth and worked with the Commonwealth in a number of ways. Obviously, there is the GST, which you referenced. Secondly, of course, there is the specific hospital reform agreement. What we're seeing is that Commonwealth funding is increasing from $294 million per annum under the previous government to $424 million this financial year to $524 million by the end of the next financial agreement. In addition to that, what we see is that there are specific partnerships.</span>

                  </a>  The answer to that question, respectfully, is that the overall Tasmanian funding, which is informed by this variety of sources which go into it, has increased quite dramatically from 25 to 32 per cent. That means that Tasmania's funding is not only up in actual dollars but up in proportionate dollars. It is one of the largest increases in the country and one of the largest proportions in the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the third area, and that is that there are specific partnerships: the $700-million-plus Mersey hospital agreement which has been injected into Tasmania's funding; the funding which the Prime Minister announced as part of the campaign with the now members for Bass and Braddon, who fought so strongly for $10 million for a mental health facility; the $10 million for an eating health facility; and, in particular, the $34.7 million for increases in emergency elective surgery funding and TAZ Outreach funding. There is $20 million towards elective surgery, as the member for Clark and I discussed recently, of which the first $5 million has already been paid as part of an agreement—something I've discussed with the Minister for Health in Tasmania, Sarah Courtney, as well as with you, Member for Clark. This is as well as the plan to make the University of Tasmania a medical research hub through the Menzies Institute for Medical Research in Tasmania and, from 1 January 2020, the new rural provider number. All of these things come together in what has been one of the most significant increases in actual dollars and proportionate dollars across the Commonwealth.</span>

Only last week I attended <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph's</span> Bush Summit in Dubbo in the member for Parkes' electorate with the Prime Minister. Farmers there made it very clear to us that they want dams. They want pipelines. They want water infrastructure. They want to heighten, lengthen and strengthen weirs. That's why we're getting on with doing just that. We put half a billion dollars into the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund last year. Those opposite are not interested in regional Australia. They're not interested in water infrastructure. It shows every day of the week.</span>

He's seen firsthand the impact that drought has had on his own electorate of Nicholls as it spreads right across this country. That's why this government has stood shoulder to shoulder with our farmers. To date, there has been nearly $1.9 billion put to supporting the here and now through programs such as increasing the amount of the farm household allowance to be able to keep bread and butter on the kitchen table of farmers and their families. It's about putting more rural financial counsellors out there to be able to sit around the kitchen tables and help our farmers fill out the paperwork but also get clarity on the decisions that they have to make. But it's also around the nearly $30 million we've put into mental health not just for farmers but also for their families, because it's children that often see the impact—the financial strain—of this drought. They see the bills on the fridge, and it's important that they're protected and understood and listened to during this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, proudly, today this government will introduce the Future Drought Fund Bill, a bill that will create a fund of $3.9 billion, escalating to $5 billion, giving a dividend of $100 million a year, in the good and the bad, that will go to build resilience in our rural communities and farming families. It'll help address climate risk. It'll help address extension, giving our farmers the tools to understand and take up the best practices they need. It'll be about leadership and building resilience in those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we've done is make sure that we've taken the politics out of it, and I've got to acknowledge the former member for Indi and the amendments that she made to bring integrity to it. We'll make sure that there's an independent committee that will consult with the community. Through a legislated consultation period of 42 days, we'll be able to go to the people whom we're there to serve. What a crazy idea it is that a government might go and ask them how this money should be spent so they can come back and give us the ideas and the concepts that need to be delivered! To add another integrity measure, we're making it a disallowable instrument so the Australian parliament will have oversight of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is above politics, and we are taking it above politics. We are taking this money from the Building Australia Fund, a fund that has not paid a dividend since 2015-16. Yet we have been able to deliver a $100 billion program of infrastructure spending, whether it be inland roads or rails right across this country. This is about making sure that we get the balance right. We are utilising a fund that has not done anything, and we are doing that in a fiscally responsible way. This is about responsibility and leadership, not politics. So the question comes to those opposite, who, in one of their lowest acts in this nation's parliament, politicised the misery of Australian farmers by voting against the Future Drought Fund Bill back in October: who do they support? Do they support Australian farming families, or do they support the continuation of cheap politics?</span>

But, on the topic of superannuation, given we're talking about the positions of parties on superannuation, does the Labor Party stand by its more than $30 billion in higher superannuation taxes? Are they going to walk away from that, or are they going to continue to see superannuation and superannuants as targets for their high-taxing policies? The Labor Party have learnt nothing since the last election. They opposed tax relief. The Leader of the Opposition opposed tax relief in this parliament, speaking against it inside and outside this chamber. They oppose our seeking to support the farmers, graziers and rural communities of this country by legislating the drought fund, yet we continue to invest in infrastructure at record levels. Investment is up $25 billion. In committed funding, we've spent more than six times the amount that the Building Australia Fund actually had in it. The Leader of the Opposition is opposition with a capital O.</span>

As she knows, last Friday the first sod of the Flinders Link rail project was turned. This is a fantastic congestion-busting project that will extend the Adelaide metropolitan rail network to Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders University and the Tonsley Innovation District. I note that the member for Boothby has been a very strong supporter of this $125 million project for a long time. What will it mean for residents in Adelaide, and in her electorate in particular?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, it's going to make it easier to access Adelaide's largest hospital and it's going to ease the parking pressures which presently exist. Of course it will also ease congestion in Adelaide as a whole by taking thousands of cars off the road. But perhaps the most important thing is that, by linking the campus to the rail network, it will make it more convenient for the 25,000 existing students and also make it more attractive to international students to go to Flinders University. And of course the university believes that this project itself will unlock $1.5 billion worth of their investments into the university, creating thousands of jobs in the process, because, as a result of this project, they will build new student accommodation, health accommodation, health research facilities and retail facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another great joint project by the Morrison and Marshall governments. Overall, we are investing $8.4 billion into South Australia for roads and rail transport there and helping Premier Marshall's drive to make it a turnaround state, in a similar way to the way in which Premier Hodgman is making Tasmania a turnaround state, because we know that, for too long in South Australia, they had a long reign of the former Labor governments, which led to low growth and a mass exodus of people from the country, and, of course, as the energy minister knows, the highest electricity prices in the world. We are changing this, and our infrastructure agenda is a very big part of supporting the regeneration of South Australia as a whole.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This incredible project which we have been discussing, the Flinders Link rail project, is just one of over 150 major projects that we have going on in this country right now—150. That's $9.8 billion being invested this financial year, which is more than double what it was when we first came to office. And of course we have another 150 major projects in the planning, as well as over 166 smaller-scale urban-congestion-busting projects— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

So I do thank him for his question and acknowledge the long relationship that Australia has had with the space sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the moon landing was such a significant moment, not just for Australia and the United States but around the world. It was responsible for inspiring so many people, and many of us have our own stories to tell. I too watched the moon landing. I sat there with my sister, and we both watched the first steps of Neil Armstrong on the moon. And can I say, as an engineer now, that not only did I want to be on that spaceship; I wanted to build it. So it inspired not only me but many other people to go on and study science, technology, engineering and maths, and we know how important that is for the jobs of the future.</span>

The coalition government is committed to growing the space industry in Australia to $12 billion and an additional 20,000 jobs by 2030.</span>

                  </a>  Importantly, space is not just about launch. Space impacts us all every single day. Australian farmers use space capability to monitor the health of their crops. Emergency workers track the progress of bushfires. Scientists study the impacts and the effects of drought. We all know how important it is for our farmers that we use every available resource to help them in this particularly difficult experience and time that they have. So we on this side of the House are committed to growing the space industry so that we are developing more jobs for scientists, for engineers, for technicians and for tradespeople. We want to make sure that our young people have opportunities that they never would have thought of 50 years ago for the jobs of the future. Let me say this: space has long been called the final frontier, but under the Morrison government space is the new jobs frontier.</span>

I have no reason whatsoever to doubt at all the competence of the secretary of the department in relation to these matters. My simple question is: why does the Labor Party seem to question the competency of the secretary? The transparency of the arrangements that he's entered into are there for them to see. All I can see is this is just another attempt by the Labor Party to get into what the former Manager of Government Business used to call the chum bucket. They're going back to the old chum bucket, as they always do. Labor never changes their business model of grubby politics in this place, and this seems to be going down the same track.</span>

During the course of the campaign, she and the Prime Minister met with 12-year-old Luke Emery in northern Tasmania, a young boy with cystic fibrosis who's a beneficiary of Orkambi. Orkambi is a medicine that we, along with the Prime Minister, were able to list last year. That medicine would otherwise cost approximately a quarter of a million dollars and be beyond the reach of virtually every patient. Luke has his future before him because of that medicine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the member for Bass, along with many others, has been an unstinting advocate for further and better action for cystic fibrosis and other issues. We know that it's very important that we can afford to do these things. Previously, in 2011, as was well discussed during the course of the last parliament, a previous government stopped listing new medicines, including for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, when at the time they said they had run out of funding, or 'due to fiscal circumstances' they were unable to list further medicines until such time as fiscal circumstances permitted. Fortunately, the fiscal circumstances are strong. I want to thank and acknowledge the work of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the finance minister and, above all else, the Australian people who have been able to do this to allow these medicines to be listed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, I am delighted that yesterday we were able to announce Kalydeco, which is a new medicine for cystic fibrosis for beautiful young children between 12 and 24 months of age. These beautiful children would otherwise not have had access to a medicine that would cost $300,000 per year. Because of the capacity to have the PBS on a strong, clear footing these medicines are now available. From 1 August Kalydeco will be available. Yesterday I met young children such as Anna and Scarlett. Scarlett is a five-year-old, as bright as a button, from Tasmania. With Scarlett what we saw is something very special. This young girl had been through the situation of early access to Kalydeco. Her health is better, her lungs are better and her life is before her, and that is what this government is about.</span>

I know he is a passionate advocate for regional and rural Australia. He stands with all of us on this side in our passion to ensure that regional and rural Australia get the services they need, including the educational services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year $17.7 billion will be provided by this government to the higher education sector for teaching and research. We want to ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, get the education that they deserve. That includes the 400,000 students living in regional and rural Australia. It is why last year we announced $135 million in a regional Australia higher education package. That included nearly 2,000 additional scholarships for regional and rural Australia. It also included $92.5 million for regional universities. I know the member for Herbert will like this, because $9.1 million went to James Cook University. It also included money for 16 regional study hubs. I visited one of those regional study hubs in Barker; there is one being provided in the Barossa. I know the member for Barker is a fierce advocate for regional study hubs. And not only that but this year we announced an additional $94 million for the Destination Australia program.</span>

                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  Thank you, very much, Mr Speaker. On the banks of the Brisbane River, in the heart of the Ryan electorate, stands Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, Australia's first and largest koala sanctuary. It's a place that is familiar to thousands of Brisbane families, and for tens of thousands of international tourists a year it's their introduction to Australia and our iconic marsupial. During the 2011 Brisbane flood, it was also a place where the local community rallied at a time of great devastation. Last Australia Day, though, surrounded by tables loaded with lamingtons, and with a local choir belting out <span style="font-style:italic;">I Still Call Australia Home</span>, it's the place where I had the privilege as a Brisbane City councillor to induct almost 50 new Australian citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that most of the members in this House will have participated in similar ceremonies at some time, so you will understand the excitement of the candidates and their unabashed love for their new homeland. During my nine years as a Brisbane City councillor I loved the deep connections I forged with my community, but no duty gave me more pleasure than those ceremonies. The candidates for citizenship had all come to Australia for different reasons—work; family; after great hardship—but all were expressive in their desire to give something back to a community that had embraced them and which had already given them so much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a fitting analogy for the excitement that I feel today. I am excited to be inducted into this place so that I can have the opportunity to give something back to the local community and the nation that I love, which has given my family so very much. It is a fitting display of the values that I am in this place to protect: a strong community made up of resilient families, whatever form those families take; a preparedness to roll up your sleeves, to support and serve your fellow residents; a willingness to work hard and make a positive impact for your community and your nation; and effective infrastructure, and that means both physical and social infrastructure that binds our communities together. If there is to be a single measure of the success of my time in this chamber, I intend it to be my contribution to ensuring that these values and institutions are strengthened. If I can help ensure that more Australians have the opportunity, as I have had, to be supported and fulfilled by a strong community, a secure family and a faith in their nation, then I will have made a worthwhile contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lived my whole life in the Ryan electorate. It's where I grew up, where I went to school and university, where I got my first job, where I work. It's where I met my wife, where my son was born and baptised, and where I am now raising my own young family. It has grounded me and has shaped me, as I hope now to have a role in shaping it. It is home to some remarkable institutions, seats of great learning and innovation like the University of Queensland at St Lucia, considered to be in the world's top 50; places of great service to our nation, including the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, home of the mighty 7th Brigade; training grounds for individual effort, like the John Carew Swim School at Chapel Hill, the nursery of some of our best Olympic swimmers; and places of extraordinary natural beauty, including Queensland's premier botanic gardens at Mount Coot-tha. And, of course, it's been home to the traditional custodians, the Jagera and Turrbal people, for millennia, and I pay my respects to their elders, past and present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any community Ryan has its challenges, and like most urban communities many of those challenges revolve around population growth and its associated social impacts. You don't grow from pineapple farms to housing estates in just a few decades without feeling those impacts. To have a connected and functional community you need infrastructure that can deliver families homes sooner and safer. You need roads that don't clog and reach capacity just because families are travelling to sport on a Saturday morning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a local councillor I helped ensure council delivered new infrastructure, including congestion-busting intersection upgrades, bikeway missing links, new buses and upgraded ferry terminals. As Brisbane's youngest-ever Treasurer I was able to balance record infrastructure expenditure while reducing Brisbane's debt by 47 per cent, in part by recycling capital out of large projects. The Brisbane City Council continues to do more than its fair share of investing in vital infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Queensland government's infrastructure funding over the forward estimates, as a share of total expenditure, sits at just 11.5 per cent, down on the decade average, and this means that motorists spend more time in traffic and less time with their families. As an example, Moggill Road, in the heart of the Ryan electorate, is No.1 in Queensland on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Infrastructure Audit</span> report for delay costs; $1.45 million is being lost due to time delays on every kilometre of that corridor every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted that the Morrison government committed a record $100 billion to ambitious infrastructure projects across Australia—in particular that the Treasurer quadrupled the funds to reduce urban road congestion from $1 billion to $4 billion. Projects that reduce urban congestion allow the taxpayer the most bang for their buck. Too often politicians are drawn to funding business case after business case in the hope of finding a big ticket, nation-defining silver bullet for infrastructure woes, yet tackling local projects with price tags of $10 million to $100 million in local communities would mean far more to the lives of Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that building a road is not an end in itself, but building a road builds a more connected community and it gets people home sooner to spend more time with their families. The SEQ city deal, which is currently being negotiated, is a unique opportunity to put this concept into practice. Particularly with such a large council as Brisbane, we can leverage federal funds and combine with local authorities to get much needed congestion-busting projects off the back burner and get them built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just the issues and places that make up a community but the people within. The beating heart of the Ryan electorate is its 39,162 families, including my own. I have been blessed to have grown up in a strong and close-knit family unit—a family where my grandmother, Gabrielle, had a formative impact on us seven young grandchildren. Growing up under the rationing of World War II, she is the reason, much to my wife's disgust, I can never bring myself to throw anything out! She taught me to have empathy for those who took positions that upset me. She taught me that, if something is worth doing, it's worth the hard work to do it well, and that everyone must roll up their sleeves and join in supporting their community. Lessons like these, so central to our nation's health and prosperity, can only be given by a family unit whose love is unconditional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When John Howard described the family as 'the stabilising and cohering unit of our society', he understood that, while it is a truism, it is certainly not a forgone conclusion. That's why he devoted so much of his government's time and energy to supporting Australian families to be resilient. Since then, families have come under a range of new and increased pressures. The proportion of family households is declining. In 1986, just after I was born, families made up 77 per cent of Australia's households, but by 2016 this was down to just over 70 per cent. Over this same period, the number of single-person households increased to 24 per cent, or essentially a quarter of the nation's households. That 'cohering unit of our society' is under siege from every direction. We live in a world so interconnected that it is almost impossible to turn off and just be present. Kids can be bullied online in their own room while parents are less than 10 feet away, and families are finding disagreement harder to manage in a world where social media trains us to be outraged at everything. So we need to step up our efforts to support family units, whatever their makeup. They play such a central role in shaping the health and wellbeing of all immediate family members. We cannot allow more and more people to be alone and disconnected in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be passionate and vocal in this place as we seek to tackle the many challenges that bedevil and chip away at families, including the cost-of-living pressures, domestic violence, bullying, isolation and relationship breakdowns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family is one of the lucky ones. My mum, Nanette, and Dad, Brett, who are in the gallery today, share a passion for their family and an ambition for their children. My success and that of my brother, Edward, and sister, Annabel, owes so much to their loving household and guiding hands. Like so many Australians, they used the well-worn but treacherous path of small business to ensure that their children were given every chance to succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But to run a small business is to make sacrifices. Early on, Dad worked extra jobs to keep money coming in, before the shop turned over enough that he could start drawing a wage. Many a childhood picture has me playing on the floor of the shop as customers dodged my toys to reach the counter. With so many people using small business as a way to give their families a leg up, we must be ruthless in our dedication to ensuring that their individual efforts, their sacrifice, are supported. Whether it's through tax cuts, IR reform or reducing power prices, I will be working to ensure that small business, and its inevitable connection with the family, remains at the heart of this government's efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to my wonderful wife, Madeline. She is the strongest person I know, fierce in protecting our family and my most trusted counsel. She is the reason I am in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the LNP values, which I hold so dear, we enshrined the principle that family is the indispensable forum where children are raised and nurtured, and the foundation of resilient communities and a cohesive society. But, for many, starting a family is not as straightforward as this would suggest. One in six couples struggle with infertility and miscarriage. Starting a family was a hell of a fight for Maddy and me, as it is for other families. It was an intensely private battle that spanned almost a decade—a battle that takes relationships right to the brink and back again. But to acknowledge it publicly is to discover suddenly that this is not a path you walk alone, that so many of your friends and contemporaries are also struggling with it. I look forward to using the opportunity this role affords me to support causes and initiatives that help couples through this heartbreaking battle, not just to improve the efficacy and availability of treatments related to IVF but also to support other ways families can come together, like foster care and adoption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite those trials, though, we have our beautiful boy, Theodore, who is just two years old. Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I thought I might speak directly to him for a moment. Theo, you won't remember being here today, but I'd like to think you'll read this speech in 10, 20 or even 50 years time to better understand your dad. The irony isn't lost on me that my speech is about communities, families and being better connected, because I know that by the time you read this it is certain that this job will have meant we missed out on a lot of time together—on a lot of special moments and even on a lot of ordinary moments as well. I want you to know that the choice of a career in public life was not one your mum and I took lightly. We understand that every moment I miss with you will be a small cut to our family, and we know that all those little cuts will leave scars on our hearts. But, rather than lament, I trust that you'll grasp the reason I went into politics in the first place, that I had to be in the fight to ensure that you grew up in a community and a nation that was the very best version of itself, and, given that our family—your family—was blessed with so very much, it was incumbent on us to roll up our sleeves and play our small part in helping facilitate similar opportunities for other families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to talk about the challenges of declining service in our community. The historical trends in volunteering are that more people are volunteering but for less time, and it's uneven. Volunteering in sport has grown, but community service has declined. As a local councillor, I saw the life-changing effects of the electorate of Ryan's service groups up close. I started groups myself, like the Indooroopilly Men's Shed. I saw firsthand how this group prevented individuals from slipping into loneliness and isolation that might otherwise have seen them lost from society. With so many traditional service organisations in our community, like Rotary and Lions, struggling with ageing and declining memberships, it is time for the federal government to look hard at how we can better support service in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for our local community organisations is a good start, but I believe we need to think about how we as a nation rebuild the ebbing belief that we have a broader duty to our communities and our fellow citizens, because it's not gone. You don't have to scratch the surface in the Ryan electorate very hard to find examples of good Samaritans, great neighbours who will go out of their way to help their fellow human beings. Brisbane's 'Mud Army' after the 2011 flood springs immediately to mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in this increasingly time-poor, disconnected world it's harder to find the everyday version of that story. I don't profess to have the answers. But, just as building a stronger and more resilient community has been the hallmark of my life as a councillor, so too will it be a priority for me in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, almost all of us come to this place because of our involvement in a community organisation—a political party. I joined the Liberal party, and now the LNP, in 2003, and I have never wavered. It has given me opportunities to serve my community, for which I am forever grateful, and has allowed me to live my values of individual responsibility for your own circumstance and for your own community. Robert Menzies observed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the greatest element in a strong people is a fierce independence of spirit. This is the only real freedom …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And with it, he said, comes 'a brave acceptance of unclouded individual responsibility'. Put more succinctly by another great leader of our party: 'If you have a go, you get a go.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always assume that people I meet are keen to get a go, that they are as ambitious for their family and their community as I am ambitious for mine. Ambition for our nation, our electorate and for ourselves to exert positive change is what ensures that this parliament does not stagnate or lack new perspectives. And I feel a genuine energy as a member of this fresh Morrison government. With the injection of so many new members, I see a generational shift that, with hard work, will allow us to deliver on the ambition that the quiet Australians have for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to record my deep appreciation for the many people who put their own lives on hold to help me. For all these people to whom untold appreciation is owed, words can never be enough. So it is through tireless effort every day that I vow to repay your faith in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my previous staff, who have assisted me in this journey, including Matt Adams, Kirsti Schwartz, Justine Froud, Sara Humphries, Caitlin Bales, Hannah Williams, Matt Tapsall, Chris Kelly, Lucy Smith, Gemma Long and Athena Brunt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the dedicated team at LNP HQ—especially president David Hutchinson and campaign director Lincoln Folo. These two contributed far more to the 2019 election result in Queensland than most will ever realise. But also the efforts of Alyson, Brodie, Leighton, Collier, Geordie, MOD, Sallyann, Bec, Angela and Janelle cannot go unremarked.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by going back to the very start of this speech, back to Lone Pine to that beautiful green sanctuary on the banks of the Brisbane River in the heart of Ryan, back to those unmistakable positive images of our nation that remain seared in my memory—koalas, lamingtons, 50 new citizens just bursting with pride in our nation, bursting with excitement at all the possibilities that flow simply from being an Australian. As long as I am in this place, I hope never to forget the sense of excitement that those people felt just to be Australians. And as long as I am in this place, I hope never to forget the sense of excitement that I feel today just to represent them and all the residents of Ryan. It is a truly great honour and I won't let them down. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I'm extremely grateful to be standing here in this place to represent the people of Macnamara. It is my privilege to stand here on the lands of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, the traditional owners of this place, and I pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Macnamara is set by the Port Phillip Bay in Melbourne on lands walked on for thousands of years by the Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation. Today I come with a message for our parliament from the Boonwurrung. With your indulgence, I'd like to share their words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We, the Boonwurrung, acknowledge that we as Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians share similar values and aspirations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are all unique with different stories, history and perspectives—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And that important fact should be recognised and understood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For thousands of years, our community has maintained our strong links to our own unique culture, language and stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But we, the Boonwurrung, believe that we should focus on what binds us together as a wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And what we can achieve together is more than what we can achieve as individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In our language, we value the concept of 'tjanabi', the coming together for a common purpose despite our differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is through tjanabi that we can unify by celebrating the things we have in common, while also valuing the knowledge of what our diverse cultures add to the Australian way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We can achieve a better tomorrow, a shared future that we can all be proud of.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Boonwurrung for allowing me to carry their generous and warm message in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a message that reaffirms my belief that we have something completely rare and unique about our country. We are home to 65,000 years of history and more than 65,000 years of wisdom, continuous culture and language. We are home to a people who have more than 65,000 years of deep connection to our land and to our water. It is up to each of us to look after our precious environment and to heed the lessons of sustainability from our planet's first conservationists: Australia's Indigenous people. I stand ready, like so many people here today, to take my place on the right side of history. I stand ready to help ensure that our First Nations people are duly recognised in Australia's Constitution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the wharfies who worked and built our beautiful Port Melbourne to the modern multiculturalism that is South Melbourne, to the beauty and evolution of Albert Park, to the coffee and culture of St Kilda, to the picture-perfect streets of Elwood, to the cool new addition of Windsor and to the place where I was born and raised in Caulfield, the electorate of Macnamara is as diverse as it is iconic. But for all our differences in background, birthplace and beliefs, there is something much greater that binds us. Having spoken with thousands of locals over the course of the campaign—on street corners, front verandas or the other end of the phone—it is clear that the people of Macnamara know that our local community, our little corner of world, is a truly special place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some, the change from our federation name of Melbourne Ports to Macnamara meant moving away from history; but I think that this change was an inspired choice and, from my family's own perspective, a fortuitous one too. Dame Annie Jean Macnamara, for whom my electorate was named, was a great Australian. She was one of the first pioneering female doctors at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. She specialised in treating polio, a crippling disease that was particularly devastating for young children. As if that were not enough, Dame Jean was also a leading scientist, devoting her days to ending Australia's early rabbit plagues and, with it, the disastrous impact upon our environment. She was also responsible for leading and shaping some of our nation's great medical minds. It is that point that proves that life is sometimes full of unexpected surprises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a campaign function just before the election, my grandfather found himself in conversation with Dame Jean's daughter, Merran Samuel. What we learnt that night was that, as a young medical student, my grandfather, Dr Hershal Cohen, was taught by the great Dame Jean Macnamara. My grandfather is watching from Melbourne right now. In preparing for today, I asked for his thoughts on his university teacher. He told me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">[Back then], not many women got into the position of medical leadership, very few. But she had a determination. And she valued the importance of looking after these people that had polio—and that was the driver. She was respected because she was the leader in her field and she was a leader in the treatment of those who were suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my grandfather's words illustrate, Dame Jean Macnamara was brilliant; but that's not what made her special. She made kids who were going through the most unimaginable pain feel just a little bit brighter. She gave families the precious knowledge that their loved ones were being looked after. When her young patients were facing that very terrifying diagnosis, she made sure that they had every care and comfort. Dame Jean had a mind to tackle the most difficult problems of her generation, but she had a heart for those who needed help the most. If that is not a good example for us in this place, I'm not sure what is. It is why it is truly my pleasure to acknowledge Dame Jean Macnamara's daughter, Merran Samuel; her granddaughter, Dr Josephine Samuel-King; and Jo's partner, Marcus Gwynne, who are all with us in the gallery today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take this opportunity to acknowledge Michael Danby, who served as the member for Melbourne Ports for 21 years. Michael Danby loved this place. He loved being here, and he loved talking about big ideas. Many didn't agree with Michael, which is probably a sign of his willingness to challenge the status quo. Michael's time in this place was full of courage. I would like to wish him and Amanda the very best for the next chapter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many others in this place, I am only able to stand here because of the sacrifices of those who came before me. My story starts with a young boy who grew up in the poorest suburbs of London. In order to help support his family, he left school at age 14 to take up an apprenticeship as a pastry chef, until the Second World War broke out. During that war, this boy witnessed one of the darkest episodes of human history and, with it, the attempted destruction of his people. Following the end of that bloody conflict, and after a brief period living and serving in the newly formed state of Israel, it was eventually Melbourne, Australia where he found the peace he was searching for with his wife and young children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Melbourne, as a pastry chef, he would wake up at 4 am to do a hard day's work, putting in backbreaking hours but never making that much money. Instead he relied on public schools for his kids and public health care for his family. And in his retirement he relied on a modest pension that somehow always had enough in it for gifts for his grandchildren. His entire life he worked hard and he told everyone that he was a rich man, but his fortune was not in wealth but in family. He was a humble giant of our nation, and he was my grandfather, Jerry Burns. On 7 September 2013, I too woke up at 4 am, just like my grandfather used to do. It was the day of the federal election and it was the culmination of months of hard work to get Michael Danby re-elected for the sixth time. It was also the day that my grandfather, Jerry Burns, passed away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather told me to do two things with my life. The first was to marry my wife, Zoe, and the second was to run as a Labor candidate. Thankfully, Zoe agreed to the first and we have been blessed with our beautiful daughter, Tia. Unfortunately my grandfather never got to meet Tia or see me run as a Labor candidate, but it is his example that has led me here today. My grandfather taught me to work hard and to look after hardworking people. He came to this country with very little, and it was this great nation that gifted him not only a good life but the possibility of building a better life for his children too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His wife, my amazing grandmother Dinah, was barely five feet tall, but she too, in almost every sense of the word, was a giant. She was born in Edinburgh, in Scotland, to a generation without security or opportunity for poor, working-class women. But Dinah overcame a world full of hurdles and hypocrisy to find safety and happiness with her beloved Jerry in Elwood, in the heart of my electorate, all the while instilling in us—her granddaughters and her grandsons—that our abilities and our ambitions were not bound by pink or blue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my mother's side, my grandmother, Gerda Cohen, was also forced to leave her homeland, considered a threat because of nothing more than her family's faith. Throughout my time at university, I had the privilege of working as a teacher's aid, assisting children at the start of their education, full of energy and innocence. And yet at the same age, just four years old, my grandmother was somehow deemed an enemy of the Third Reich. My grandmother was born to a world that deemed her unequal before she even learnt to read. Thankfully, she was able to escape with her parents to make that long journey across the world as an asylum seeker to Australia, but even in her home, in the decades that followed, Gerda would always remind us that she was one of the lucky ones. While she was able to escape and build a life here in Australia, much of my family did not escape and perished in the darkest hour of mankind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the lessons from each of my grandparents, Jerry, Dinah, Hershal and Gerda, that guide my policy ambitions in this place. Their stories today are as important as ever. My grandfather Jerry, who built a life for his family with nothing more than his two hands, reminds me that we must find new ways to help more Australians find financial security. The eight-hour day is disappearing. Australians are working longer hours than ever before, while at the same time the number of those who are able to afford their own home is plummeting. Thirty years ago, six out of 10 people my age owned their own home. Today that number is closer to four and rapidly diminishing. It's clear the old road to financial security is closed for too many Australians. People are working harder than ever, but they are finding it more and more difficult to find financial security. It's why we as a nation need to be willing to have an honest conversation about the way our economy is working and exactly who it is working for. Because, just as my grandfather and his generation understood, being Australian shouldn't mean you are granted a life of privilege; it should mean that you can work hard to achieve financial security for yourself and for your family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandmother Dinah's story reminds me that we must continue our work to ensure that women in Australia are getting the fair share that they deserve in their life choices, in their workplaces and in their fight for equal pay. We've taken some great strides but, in the decades on from my grandmother's experience, it's clear we have a long way to go. As a father, a friend, a husband but, fundamentally, as a human being, I acknowledge my responsibility in securing that better, fairer future for Australian women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather Hershal's life as a doctor instilled in me that having access to world-class health care is part of what it is to be Australian. It means access to health care regardless of your background or bank balance but it should also mean universal access to mental health care—something that we are still a long way from achieving. My family, like so many others, has been impacted by mental illness. As a society, on so many accounts, we are making good progress, but while people continue to slip through the cracks there is still so much more to do—just one example: the current arrangement of only being able to access 10 mental health sessions a year via Medicare should be increased. For anyone who has watched a loved one suffer, you know that on every measure 10 sessions is woefully inadequate. Simply put: we can, and we must, do better. As a nation and as a parliament we owe it to those Australians and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my grandmother Gerda's story—a story of persecution and prejudice—has etched in me a fierce opposition to bigotry in all its forms. I was born in Bob Hawke's Australia in an era when the Australian identity was perhaps at its proudest but never at the exclusion of others. In more recent times, we've seen the rise of something new—a sinister element that argues that this nation belongs only to a core few and that by virtue of nothing more than background, birthplace, race or religion, others must reside on the outer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only months before the election in the heart of my electorate, we saw that racist underbelly march on St Kilda Beach. Of course, it's not the only instance with a rise in bigotry seen the world over. The question for us here in this place is: how can we fight what feels like a rising tide? I believe, as is so often the case, the answer lies with Bob Hawke and his unique brand of patriotism: taking pride in our nation while continuing to be persistent in our defence against discrimination and ignorance. It is up to all of us in this place to ensure Australia is a country that celebrates our differences and our diversity. It is up to all of us in this place to say strongly and without fear that no matter your gender, sexuality, race or religion, here in Australia you are one of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before I finish, if you will indulge me briefly, I wish to acknowledge some of the other people who have helped me get here today. At the top of my list is my beautiful wife Zoe—thank you for your love and for doing more than you should to support me. I love coming home to you and sharing our lives, and I couldn't do this without you. To my beautiful daughter, Tia: being away from you is the hardest part of my day, and I hope you'll forgive me for my time in this place but know that I love you more than I thought I could love anyone. To my incredible parents, Leanne and Phil: you are both fierce campaigners and have helped me achieve far more than my high school teachers thought possible. You have both given me nothing but love and support, and I consider myself very lucky to be your son. To my humble and brilliant little sister Bec and my wise and gentle little brother David, I am truly blessed to be part of our trio. To my former boss Daniel Andrews, my former colleagues and in particular Jessie McCrone and Lissie Ratcliff, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for your friendship and help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Ari Suss and Mark Dreyfus for your guidance and advice; to Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek and the entire Labor team who helped us win in Macnamara; to the Labor true believers who are part of a hopeful and ambitious campaign; and to my entire campaign team who worked so hard, especially Dean, Millie, Micky, Simon, Dakota, Thomas, Adam, Sam, Julia, Ralph, Louise, you're all worthy of being etched into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> as outstanding political professionals and I couldn't be prouder to have campaigned alongside you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my friends and family who have made the journey up to Canberra today; to Anthony Albanese, my good friend Richard Marles and every member of the Labor caucus for their warm welcome; and, most importantly, to the people of Macnamara who put their trust in me: thank you all so much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Mr Speaker, I stand here with humility, ready to honour those who have come before me; I stand here with gratitude to a nation that has given my family safety and opportunity; I stand here proudly as a member of the mighty Australian Labor Party; and I stand here, in this place, as the first member for Macnamara, ready to work hard and ready to look after hardworking people. Thank you very much.</span>
              </p>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  As we stand on this ground and take our seats in this chamber, we must be forever mindful that we are being carried on the shoulders of 1,600 generations of Indigenous people. Scientists and artists and parents and children have been here for millennia. Our First Nations people are the world's oldest astronomers. Their connection between land and sky and people allowed them to navigate and predict the patterns of seasons, weather, flora and fauna. Both Indigenous knowledge and modern Western science strive to understand how our world works. Both our First Nations and our nation's scientists value collaboration in a shared pursuit of higher knowledge. So, then, do these Australians signpost our way forward as we take our seats in this new parliament, connecting land, sky and people with evidence and hope. I have high hopes. Our future needs hope. Australians need hope, and we who are standing in this parliament need to bring hope now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful to be here and for this opportunity. I want to thank the Lilley campaign team, particularly those who lived and died by the count in that warehouse in Zillmere. I want to thank my colleagues who have given me their time and their guidance: the members for Maribyrnong and Sydney, my good friend the member for Rankin, and the member for Grayndler—who, in his own words mused during the election campaign, 'If he'd spent any more time in Lilley, he would have had to enrol there.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the people of Lilley for the trust they have placed in me. I am here for you all, from the Greens voter in Stafford to the One Nation voter in Deagon and everyone else—however you cast your vote in May. I am grateful that you have given me three years to prove myself to you and to win over the 49.35 per cent two-party-preferred voters who didn't quite vote for me last time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here for the people of Lilley who grew up in St Vincent's orphanage in Nudgee, a significant number of whom are still dealing with the effects of the abuse they suffered there. I am here for Alexina, who lives there now, and for Denae, who works there, with the site now converted to Mercy Community aged care—part of a recent, nation-leading trial for geriatrician led services specialised for acutely unwell age-care residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here for the people in Lilley who have been in the electorate long enough to remember when the Shorncliffe Pier bathing sheds were used by the Sandgate Ladies Life Saving Club, the first women's lifesaving club in Queensland. And I am here for the people who arrived just in time to see Tidelands—the first all-Australian Netflix series filmed in Shorncliffe last year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what do I bring to this place? Yes, my CV includes a law degree and, yes, I have worked here before in the ministerial wing, and the election campaign made it very clear to me what a gift those things are to any opponent wanting to portray someone as the Labor candidate from central casting. But I am not here to be anyone's stereotype. I am here to be me. I was born while this building was being constructed. 2019 is the first year in which we have more Australians born after 1980 than before, and more millennials in the workforce than baby boomers and gen Xers combined, and yet we form only 10 per cent of this parliament. Millennials will be left dealing with the consequences of the choices this parliament makes. More millennials need a seat at the table. This table—or near this table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous generations have grown up with world wars, the Depression and the threat of nuclear war. Millennials have grown up with our own keen sense that the apocalypse is always possible. We are the generation of 9/11, of school shootings and of the global financial crisis. We are the generation that has not brought about, but that is witnessing, a growing extinction event as species after species disappear forever at a rate unprecedented in human history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, while we were gearing up to fight the election, Australia became the first country to lose a mammal to climate change. It has been lost and that loss has changed nothing. It was news until it stopped being news just hours later. In the near future, the North Pole will cease to be covered with ice in summer; it will be a dark ocean absorbing heat instead of a vast sea of white ice reflecting it. It will be time to colour in the top of the globe. Two things distinguish humans from other mammals. Our imagination and our capacity to render the planet unlivable. The first can either remedy the second or enable it—that's up to us. Let's choose to find the collective will to use our imaginations for the betterment of the place we live in, a place with ice at the poles and fish in the seas and rivers, a place where people wake up each day thinking that they are valued and that they have prospects, a place where people can wake up feeling safe and that they are likely to receive a reasonable return for any work that day might bring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our imaginations, if we let them, take us into the future and allow us to build it. Our imaginations, if we let them, take us into the lives and shoes and hearts of others and lead us to make decisions for their good and for the common good. Or, we can choose not to imagine. We can live in the moment, and in our own moment, and to our own short-term advantage. We can shut out the cries for help; we can shut out the evidence that calls for change. I am here because I want to live a better life than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many big debates aren't right versus left; they're short term versus long term. We cannot prioritise one at the expense of the other, even at a time when a new cycle—the electoral cycle—and the bills coming in all draw us to short-term-ism. It must never be beyond us to get the long term right, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here to be a good member of my community, to be a good parent and, as Jonas Salk said, to be a good ancestor. I am here because nothing has more power to make or dismantle this nation's future than this House. The work this House does shapes lives now and long into the future. This parliament has at times done great things. Our very first parliament in its second year passed the bill that made Australia the first independent country to give women a vote in national elections. The 26th Parliament brought about the referendum that righted the wrong of Indigenous noncitizenship. The Hawke and Keating years are well remembered for bringing us economic reforms that have increased long-term national prosperity and for bringing universal health care in the form of Medicare—an extraordinary achievement that has made our health system among the best in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently still, in the 42nd and 43rd parliaments my predecessor as the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, in his role as Treasurer, took Australia through the global financial crisis as the only developed nation not to experience a recession. While the rest of the developed world went under that juggernaut, policy decisions made in this place pulled Australia out of the way. Too little credit is given for that. You don't think twice about the train that doesn't run you over and simply passes by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is, of course, more work to do. In my time in the private sector as a workers comp lawyer I assisted and represented people who had been injured at work. This reinforced something that I already knew to be true: not everyone who has a go gets a go. Life is not that simple or that reliably benevolent. We are not as good as we should be at fighting disadvantage sensibly and collaboratively and with regard to the evidence of what works and what does not. We also are not great at making space for people who don't fit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was at school and my friends and I used to play handball by the tuckshop, there were four squares, and they were labelled Ace, King, Queen and Joker. But one of my friends didn't like any of those. She wanted to be in a square for Ninja Turtles. We wouldn't let her, and she wandered off. She didn't play; she opted out. We need to be a parliament and a community that does more for our Ninja Turtles, that values difference and includes it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be measured by how we treat those who don't fit the squares, those without advantage, those not enfranchised, those who don't understand the paperwork, those who are shut out by the system, those who cast their votes reluctantly or not at all. We need to be here at least as much for the people who have stopped believing in this parliament as we are for those who still do believe. We need to convince them that this place is relevant to them, has their interests at heart and will about accordingly. And we need to do that by actually being relevant to them, having their interests at heart and will act accordingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You all know that I had to wait a little longer to book my ticket here than most of you did. In the recent election I did not step into a safe seat and see it stay safe on my watch. In the days after the election, when the count was close and nothing was decided, many people reached out to me saying how tough that must be. But I had three little girls of Lilley giving me a sense of perspective. Skye gave me perspective. At four, Skye is trapped in her own body, born with a one-of-a-kind genetic condition that renders her mentally astute but unable to sit, stand, walk or crawl on her own. When Skye's family was told that she would need a walking frame, they were told to wait for the NDIS to source one. Eighteen months later, and in the last weeks of the campaign, Skye's mum, Vanessa, hit the final hurdles of that process. When the news reached me, it took one phone call to get Skye the approval for the walking frame she needed. I want to be part of a parliament that does better by Skye and that goes after the unknowns of pregnancy, stillbirth and child and maternal health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sasha gave me perspective. Six days after the election, as the count continued, I attended the Kalinga Park Sorry Day ceremony. I didn't meet Sasha but I met her parents. Somewhere, Sasha is 40 now but still a baby girl to them, as she was taken from them in infancy, and they have not found her since. Sasha is a member of the stolen generations, and I want to be part of a parliament that does better by Sasha and that continues the work of the Rudd government to own up to and address this wrong, that closes the gap and that enables an Indigenous voice to parliament on Indigenous terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Celeste gave me perspective. She's my daughter. Celeste was two when Australians voted and she did not care about the election, but I cared about the world that I want for her. In 2016, 20 weeks into my pregnancy with Celeste, I became ill. I was diagnosed with a serious autoimmune disease at 26 weeks and, with Celeste on board, all the good drugs weren't an option. Celeste was born three weeks early and underweight, and as I lay there with her in one arm and an IV in the other, finally giving me the treatment I needed, I saw coverage of the women's marches in America that had happened a few days before. For many of the marching women, those marches were their first political act. Until then, they had thought that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats and decency would prevail. In my hospital bed in Brisbane, I felt like one of them. Like them, to borrow from Martin Luther King, who borrowed from Theodore Parker, I had assumed that the arc of the moral universe would always continue to bend towards justice, and in that moment I worried that I was wrong. I resolved then not to take that arc for granted anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot leave the future to fend for itself. I want to be part of a parliament that prioritises the making of a better world for Celeste; for the young people in all of those lives; for their children who have not yet been born; for their grandchildren who have not yet been contemplated; and for their descendants who, in the centuries ahead, will live on this land and gather in this place and do their own work, making the future. I believe in them, just as I believe in us and all that we can yet achieve in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I realise that the future is not just a vision of something imprecisely better than the present. Like the present, it too will be made of an uncountable number of complex and interlocking details. Let's make our differences in detail a healthy contest of ideas, of reason and evidence designed to take us to robust solutions. To take the lead of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we can strive to disagree without being disagreeable. We should model the way for Australians to debate complex issues. We will not serve them well if we win the 6 pm skirmish but we fail to win the era.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all of us, I cannot be here without support, and I am so grateful for the chance to honour my wolf pack: Best Friends Club and the Northside Massive—many of whom are here today. To all the little wolf cubs, Harriet and Alby and Archie and Ivy and Charlie and Anna and Rafi and Sebby and Abigail and Gwenny and Margot and Macsen and Arianwen and our littlest cub Maxwell: just like Moana, one day you are going to look around and realise happiness is right where you are.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my husband, Finn, and my daughter, Celeste, for what they do for me every day. There's a Banjo Paterson poem that makes me think of them:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">May be reft of their golden hue;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But, my own sweetheart, I shall love you still,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just as long as your eyes are blue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Celeste, you are a reminder every day of how much the future matters and of how much love matters. Finn, you make sacrifices to allow me to be here, because you live your values. When I stand up for more women in leadership I know you stand beside me, even if you're standing at a change table in Chermside and I am standing in the parliament near this table. It is because we both know we will live in a better world when women are freer to lead, men are freer to embrace parenting and all are freer to take turns and share. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of us given the opportunity to parent, it is a chance to meet the future face to face. Turning our girls into strong women with the freedom to act and to choose and to be makes all of us better. Turning our boys into great men is a journey of a million steps too. Every person who reads a young boy a book with a female protagonist or makes a teenage boy do his own washing or teaches a young man that it is structurally harder for his female counterpart to progress is doing their part for our collective hope that together we can forge a fairer community of the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my parents, Deb and Kent, whose unending love and support rendered me to be the questioning, questing and determined person I am. I want to thank my blood brothers, Adam and Kym, and my brothers in arms, Mitchell and Jared. I hope everything I put you through feels worthwhile! I can never repay you all for what you've done for me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my most indefatigable local branch member, Wayne Swan; my most loyal local constituent, Anthony Chisholm; Julie-Ann Campbell; Mark Bellaver; Steve Baker; Chris Gazenbeek; Gary O'Halloran and polling booth 'hander-outer-er', Peter Biagini—all great enablers on my journey here, all of whom encouraged me to see myself as a fitting successor to Wayne's local legacy. For mum, dad and Wayne, all fans of 'the Boss', I will now invoke Bruce Springsteen, whose version of the song <span style="font-style:italic;">High Hopes</span> Finn and I played as the recessional at our wedding. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish today as we did then and as I mean to continue: with high hopes. There have been 1,600 generations that have come before us in this country, and it is up to us to prepare it for generations ahead. It is up to us to prepare it now, to take action now and to set the course now, because we can't leave this work undone for some unborn others to pick up and fix, and because now is the only moment we have. We don't have time to squander or to sacrifice to pettiness. I am determined to be a good ancestor, but I only have now to be one. We all only have now. But here in this place we have the privilege of shaping the now that will decide the long future. Now is the cornerstone the future is built on. Now is when we craft the world we want for our descendants. Let's do it with high hopes. I thank the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> today is really unusual. There are times when we rush legislation through. I remember John Howard coming in here and rushing legislation through on national security issues where an amendment had to be made so that arrests could take place later that week. It was urgent. We held emergency meetings, and it all went through straightaway and it was cooperative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the parliament last sat, the government had broken its promise to recall parliament before the end of the financial year and there was a priority to make sure that the stage 1 tax cuts were able to get into people's pockets. That week only had three days scheduled and one of them was to be dedicated to the memory of Bob Hawke. Therefore, the only way we could make sure that the bill could make it to the Senate was for there to be cooperation across the floor and to make sure that the debate could go through all stages on the first night. We did that for a very good reason. We had to get something through both houses that was to be backdated. There was a level of urgency and immediacy in the actions of the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we are about to have legislation before us which starts taking effect on 1 July 2020. Whether it goes through this House today or tomorrow—and it's going to make it through the House; no-one doubts that, and I suspect it will make it through the Senate as well—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  but there is a procedure here that the government—and I acknowledge the interjection from the minister because it actually says it all. He said, 'Why play the game?' I say to the House, this place is not meant to simply be a game. There is a process that happens with legislation that I have to say does matter. It does matter that members have the opportunity to read legislation which is being introduced in an amended form before they are asked to vote on it. Given that the vast majority of members of this House are members of political parties, it is reasonable that those party room meetings are allowed to take place not while the House is sitting but actually during the Tuesday morning period on the timetable of this House that is deliberately set aside so that the party room meetings can happen and we can then make collective decisions on legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is only one reason why the government have decided that they want this legislation to be rushed through tonight—it's because they have decided to play the game. There is no other reason. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  He's not the agriculture minister anymore; he's the minister for drought. He acknowledges that and says that there is a reason. Yes; the reason is politics. There's a giveaway. Every time the opening line of a government minister is, 'This will be a test for Labor,' and not, 'This will help farmers,' we know what you're on about. Every time the opening line from a minister of this government is, 'We're going to find out whose side Labor is on,' we know the objective has nothing to do with the people who are the subjects of the legislation. That of itself isn't necessarily an argument against the bill, but it is an argument against rushing the bill and it is an argument against demanding that members of this House vote on legislation without having had an opportunity to consider it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just had first speeches from members of parliament who are now in their second week of sittings. Saying that something was introduced in the last parliament doesn't give a whole lot of consolation to people who were not members of it—those on our side, on the crossbench and on the government benches as well. The public have a right to believe that members of parliament will at least have time to read what is in front of them. The public have a right to expect that the debate in this House will in some way be informed by the contents of the bill, not the report of the focus group. The public have a right to expect that the government will do more than, as the minister said, play the game—and that is what they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to remind every member of this House of the impact of this motion. People need to know that this is not a procedural motion in the sense of suspending the standing orders. Leave was given so the question is in fact in front of us. The motion I have moved does not suspend the standing orders. It is simply asking the government to adjourn the debate after the minister's speech and resume the debate tomorrow. There will be people who are concerned. Will this make a difference to the timing of any farmers receiving drought assistance? The answer is no. Will this make a difference to the timing of the Senate consideration of the bill? The answer is no. Will this make a difference to the proper order of the parliament and good process in this room? The answer is yes. The House would simply be resolving that that is what we are asking the government to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is in nothing in this motion condemning the government and there is nothing in this motion that is in any way critical of the legislation, but just wait for the speeches from the other side as to why they are opposed to this motion. There will be nothing about process in it. There will be nothing there about proper consideration. They'll pretend that this means that Labor is somehow opposed to farmers receiving assistance, and that will be because they're still wanting to play the game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a really simple principle at stake. Some people will say: 'Why don't you just roll over? Just put up with it and let the debate move on. Don't let the government attack you.' The reason is simple. We can't let the parliament degenerate to this, where pieces of legislation are brought in and immediately voted on even though there is no public policy reason for urgency beyond waiting till tomorrow. There is nothing in this motion that creates any difficulty for a single farmer. There is nothing in this motion that makes a tiny bit of difference to when the Senate will debate and consider this legislation. Certainly, they will say that it makes a difference as to whether the Senate will start on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. It certainly doesn't make any difference to when it will get to the Executive Council, which is the moment when it becomes law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only issue that is in front of us now is: are we going to allow the government to keep playing the game? Let's face it, this Prime Minister at the moment thinks that whenever he can put pressure on Labor, whenever he can play the game and whenever he can bash a political opponent about the head is a good day for him. I have to say that a day when you help farmers who are in trouble is a good day. A day when you deliver something to stop people having their wages stolen is a good day. A day when the parliament functions like an adult chamber is a good day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the government members to note that we haven't come in here condemning them for what they have put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. We are genuinely asking them to do on this legislation what we do on everything else. We are asking them to do this legislation in the way this parliament functioned last term, the term before that, the term before that and the term before that, all the way back to the time that it was recognised that most members of this House were members of parties. In that, I respect absolutely that there are different issues for Independents too in wanting to have time to consider the bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask members of the House, given that this motion will make no difference at all to the timing of drought assistance, to consider deeply whether or not we believe that it should become standard practice in this place for legislation to be rushed through without being read—because that's what's about to happen. We know that the bill that's going to be introduced is an amended bill. It is not the same bill that last went to the parliament. We know that it's amended. We also know that the last time they brought a bill in—the last time they did this—they never bothered to put it to the Senate for the vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that, when the parliament last sat, they introduced 26 bills to the chamber that week. There were 26 bills, and this government said to the members of the House, 'We want you to go away during the break, consider these bills and come up with a position on them'. The different shadow ministers have been working through the bills that were introduced and making sure that we have finalised our position on each and every bill. We have been getting briefings from the departments to work through, clause by clause, the contents of the bills. We are always grateful to the assistants and the ministers who make sure that those briefings are available. That doesn't happen when you introduce a bill in this form and deny even a party room meeting where backbench members can ask the shadow minister who has been briefed about issues of concern that they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the government, I say: think carefully about this one. From the government's perspective, they might think, 'Oh, wow. Here's a chance to put a bit of pressure on Labor and that will help us in a few newspapers tomorrow morning,' and they're probably right. But I remind the government: if the government decides that proper process in this House no longer matters, then don't come to the opposition asking us to assist with proper process. If it is the government's view that legislation that is not time sensitive between today and tomorrow afternoon is going to be rushed through, simply for the sport of preventing the Labor Party caucus from meeting and simply for the game of preventing members of this House from being properly informed, then don't think our response will only be with respect to one item of legislation and don't think our entire response is contained in the contents of the motion being moved right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I haven't made it simple enough and if I haven't been blunt enough to the government members, let me put it in these terms: what has been put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in the long term, in the medium term and in the short term is a really dumb idea. It is a tactic that I reckon will play well for the government in the media cycle for the next 24 hours on one particular issue. But government members should think of the number of times they come to the opposition seeking cooperation and the number of times leave is requested of the opposition for the proper workings of this parliament. They should bear in mind that the only thing that the opposition has requested in this resolution is that we continue the debate after the minister's second reading speech tomorrow. That's all we're asking for. Because it makes a fundamental difference to the processes of this House to the extent to which members of parliament are properly informed and the extent to which members of this House are responsibly voting. Because, first and foremost, beyond everything else, our constitutional responsibility in this place is as legislators. That's our job. We've got lots of other things we do as members of parliament, as advocates, as helping people with their problems but, constitutionally, first and foremost, our job is as legislators. And if this government wants to undermine that and thinks that there won't be a response, then government members are sorely mistaken.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I second the motion. If this motion moved by the member for Watson is not supported by the government then any doubt that people in this nation might've had about what the major driver of this government's third-term agenda is will ebb away entirely. And it's already ebbing away for farmers who are doing it tough in drought ravaged communities who saw the Prime Minister at the Bush Summit last week offer not one single new agenda item for them. For manufacturing businesses and workers, hundreds of thousands of workers, who are coming to grips with the most serious energy crisis to afflict this country since the mid-1970s, this is not an energy crisis caused by an internal shock as was the case in 1974; it is an energy policy caused by mismanagement of that policy area by this government. For households who are experiencing unprecedented wage stagnation, and plummeting consumer confidence and living standards, it is becoming increasingly clear what is driving this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is simply driven by the creation of conflict. It is simply driven by increasingly crude attempts to divide the nation, to divide this parliament, instead of helping us come together to deal with the very, very serious issues that are confronting Australia. All we have from this Prime Minister is a laser-like focus, to use the words of the last parliament, on partisan politics instead of the national interest. So it is with this latest crude, transparent attempt to ram this legislation through without any proper parliamentary process or the ability of the opposition in the longstanding customary way to hold a caucus meeting and consider the terms of the legislation. We're not asking for the usual convention, which is for a bill to be presented and then the subject of debate, perhaps, in the next week; we're simply asking for 24 hours so that the Labor Party caucus can come together tomorrow morning and consider this bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Watson made clear, this is not the same caucus that considered the bill earlier this year. This is a different caucus. The bill reflects the terms of amendments that were adopted by this House. It is not the same bill that was considered by a different Labor caucus earlier this year, and we are only asking for 24 hours. Now, just to give a sense of that being quite a significant concession by the opposition to the government, the former manager of parliamentary tactics for the coalition, the member for Sturt, said back in November 2012:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The convention has always been that a bill should be introduced and then debated the following sitting week, not the next day. Only in the rarest circumstances is the parliament required to have a bill introduced and then debated the next day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former member for Sturt saw a 24-hour period of consideration of a bill to be the rarest of circumstances. He didn't even acknowledge the possibility that a bill would be introduced and debated and dealt with by this chamber on the same day. This is just extraordinary. I challenge the minister in his response to this debate to point to another circumstance where a bill has been introduced, debated and dealt with on the same day without the ability of the opposition caucus, whether it's a coalition or Labor caucus, to consider the bill and come to a proper conclusion. As the member for Watson said: what is the rush? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that saw only one of these two bills pass the House and then just lie on the Senate table. They didn't even bring it on for a vote in the Senate, week after week, over the course of the earlier part of this year. And, as the member for Watson made clear, the bill itself—if passed, which presumably it will be—would see money able to be drawn down under its provisions on 1 July next year at the earliest, presumably funding projects that you wouldn't expect to see starting to feed into regional communities until calendar year 2021 at the earliest, you would have thought. That is the year after next. What on earth is the rush that would not allow this government to grant the opposition and crossbench members 24 hours to consider the terms of this bill?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we know what the reason for the rush is. It is this Prime Minister's obsession with creating conflict, his obsession with seeking to divide this nation and to divide the parliament, instead of bringing us together to deal with issues of national interest. And that's all in spite of Labor's very strong record over recent years of supporting all the government's significant measures designed to deal with this terrible drought that is afflicting Australia—changes to the farm household allowance, increases to the farm asset threshold, and many more measures that were proposed by the government, considered in good faith by the shadow minister, who's joined us in the chamber, and supported by the Labor caucus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we have a good record on this. And, as I said, in the ordinary course of events we'd have a shadow cabinet meeting tonight and a caucus meeting tomorrow morning and would be able to come into this chamber tomorrow and have a debate—24 hours notice between the introduction of the bill and debate. Even the former Manager of Government Business, the former member for Sturt, said it would be the rarest of circumstances to have only 24 hours. We are happy to have a proper debate about this bill. It is an important bill from the perspective of drought-ravaged communities and the perspective of Australia's infrastructure agenda. This is an important debate for this parliament to have, but it's proper that the debate happen after due consideration of the provisions of the bill by the opposition and frankly also by members of the caucus—consideration that would happen, as I calculate it, over the next 16 to 20 hours. What on earth is the rush?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is increasingly clear—and this is a very serious issue for this parliament and this nation—as this third-term government starts to frame its agenda for the next three years that this Prime Minister doesn't care about this parliament coming together to deal with the national interest. This Prime Minister cares only about fomenting division. He cares only about trying to create conflict and create some short-term political advantage for him and his political party as a result of that conflict. As the member for Watson said, even the minister—who I thought was better than this—has fallen into this trap that you're either with the government or against the government. Whatever the policy topic of the day is, clearly the talking points went out this morning from the Prime Minister's office and every minister—and I thought this minister was better than that—used the talking points. Whatever the issue is—insert issue—whose side are you on? Could you be any more juvenile than this? But that's what you get from a Prime Minister focused only on fomenting conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger issue here than just this bill—and this bill is a very important bill, for drought-affected communities and for Australia's infrastructure agenda—is that this is starting to frame every single approach by this government. As a result of simply trying to foment conflict, this government is able to distract from the really big issues facing this nation, and the complete lack of an agenda this government has particularly to deal with the deteriorating nature of our economy. As I said, in my portfolio area we have the most serious energy crisis afflicting this country since the mid-1970s. On my last count, the government is, since 2016, up to its 13th or 14th energy policy. And instead of trying to land something that will actually alleviate the position of households and businesses, all they can do is foment conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no agenda by this government to deal with the fact that GDP per person in Australia has gone backwards for three quarters in a row. That hasn't happened since the early 1980s. Productivity growth is falling off a cliff. Wages have been stagnating for years. There is no plan by this government to deal with any of those serious economic issues and, as a result of their complete lack of an agenda to deal with the serious issues facing this country, all this Prime Minister can do is foment division, foment conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to sit back and watch the longstanding processes and conventions of this parliament fall victim to a Prime Minister so focused on partisan politics—so focused on dividing this nation and dividing this parliament. We insist upon having 24 hours for our caucus to be able to consider this bill properly, come back to this parliament tomorrow and have a full debate about the implications of its provisions, to ensure that parliamentary process is followed with this bill and every other bill that this government seeks to introduce after it.</span>

This is about process. This is about process and—I acknowledge the member for Watson talking about us here being legislators—understanding the practical application of the legislation that we put in place. That's why it's time critical. The reality is we are putting in a process of integrity—and I have to acknowledge the former member for Indi for the amendments that she put forward in October that put greater integrity around what this Future Drought Fund Bill is about, to make sure that both Australians in the agriculture sector and Australian taxpayers have faith and confidence that the money, the $100 million a year that we'll be putting in place, has the integrity and structure around it in time to be delivered in July 2020. That's what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to create a consultative committee, an independent one, that will go out and consult the community for a legislated period of 42 days. What a crazy idea that a government might go out and tell the people who are impacted and going to continue to be impacted by the drought that they are being listened to, and ask them that they come back with concepts and ideas for how this $100 million can be spent in a responsible way! We also have to get the Regional Investment Corporation in a position to give us the advice to be able to implement that by 2020. That's why it's not coming in till 2020. But we've got measures in the interim—$1.9 billion here and now—to keep them going. This is about making sure that this is there is a long-term and sustainable approach to drought support in this country. This is about us making sure we get this right. But we have to get it done by July 2020. We are running out of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make this clear. While we in this place might pass this bill, we will then have to move it to the Senate, and we are unaware of how long it will take us to negotiate the passage of that bill through the Senate. Unfortunately, the track record of those opposite is not great, because in October last year they voted against this bill. They voted against it. So why would we not want to put this in train straightaway for me to be able to deliver it? Those opposite say, 'It's taking so long.' It's because of due process. It's about good governance. It is about good government. It's about consultation with those that we are going to impact. But let me say this: when those opposite talk about wanting to have a caucus meeting, I haven't been asked by the opposition—</span>

I have to acknowledge the former member for Indi for her leadership and maturity through this. She is truly a great Australian.

                  </a>  The member for Hunter has finally found the courage to come out from under the rock that he has been hiding under for the last two years. It's funny that a near-death experience finally brings him out. There was not one question to me while I was ag minister, even about the drought. And now you sit here not even asking me for a briefing. Let's be honest about this. This is about us delivering what we promised. This is about us making sure that we put in place a sustainable drought policy that will support Australian farming families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't about what those opposite said when we put this up. They said, 'Let's just appropriate the money'. Let me tell you what happens when you just appropriate the money. A couple of years down the track what happens is you will find a Treasurer who says, 'We're a bit short this year. Instead of $100 million we're only going to put in $25 million.' What we are doing is we are legislating the $100 million, protecting it for Australian farming families in climate risk management. In extension, to be able to give farmers the tools and understanding to be able to go out and use those, to be able to work through a change in climate as we have, to complement the $1.1 billion that farmers and the government are putting into research and development. Farmers are ahead of the game in terms of climate adaptation. We're proud of it. There is more to do. This underpins the agricultural sector but it also underpins regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you, it's not just farmers who hurt; it's also the small businesses in those communities who hurt. The bricks and mortar down the main street of Longreach or Colac are fighting to be able to keep their employees. This is about making sure that we have a sustainable approach and that we have a centrepiece for a drought policy. For the first time in our nation's history we're showing leadership. That's what this is about but it's time critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what's going to happen in the other place and it's important that every day counts. Unless we can get this through, I can't guarantee that I'll be able to deliver by June 2020. That's why it's important to me that we get this through, and that's why it's important to those regional communities out there, who we respect. It's important to Australian farming families that for once the drought policy in this country is supported by both sides.</span>

                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I was there in Dubbo last Thursday at the Bush Summit convened by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>. I was there talking with farmers, reaching across the aisle to try and get agreement for something that should be above politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen with this quite extraordinary reaction by the government is an attempt to play politics, not just on the policy outcomes but now on the procedures as well. I've been in this place for 23 years. I can't recall any time in which a government had a sitting week—just a couple of weeks ago—where they introduced some 26 bills into the House of Representatives and then a couple of weeks later they said, 'We need to introduce legislation on Monday and have a debate and conclusion of that on that very day.' The reason those processes exist is to get good governance, to get good outcomes and to enable appropriate processes, including caucus processes, to take place. It's about respect, it's about a bit of decency for those processes, and the government is trashing it. It's trashing it so that it can try and play a little wedge game about drought. That's why it's doing it. The minister knows it's wrong. This minister, the Leader of the House, might know it's wrong—I'm not sure—but the minister knows it's wrong. I'll tell you why it's wrong also on policy outcomes. When the legislation was debated in the House of Representatives, the truth is that it was improved by proper processes. There was greater accountability put around the scheme that was originally proposed—good governance. Amendments worked out by the cross-benchers with the opposition—eventually, reluctantly, agreed to by the government—led to a better outcome. That's a good thing. That's why we have proper processes: you get better outcomes. You would on this issue as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with measures like this is that what goes around comes around and bad behaviour creates other bad behaviour. We formerly had a member here who lost his seat to the member for Warringah at the last election, in part because of a perception amongst people in his own constituency about negative politics and just saying no to everything. Don't tell me, like the Prime Minister did today, about oppositional politics, because I went to that drought summit and I offered to support any level of funding under the system designed, now by this legislation, and put up by the government and to put it straight through the parliament, with proper processes. That was just last Thursday. The Prime Minister, before the Bush Summit, gave no notice that he was going to make that request of me. It was not one-on-one, when we were having a chat beforehand, but from the lectern. That is how that was done. That's okay. I'll cop that. It's the right of someone who's the Prime Minister of the country to occasionally play those cards. I responded. I didn't complain about that process; I responded. Then there was a briefing to <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> and others the next day that somehow we were opposed to drought funding. We had said precisely the opposite—that we not only supported it but would support it at any level the government wanted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the difference in terms of the impact on the budget of abolishing the Building Australia Fund in order to fund this drought fund? There is zero fiscal difference because the Building Australia Fund only has an impact on the budget bottom line when it's expended. At the moment, it's just there. There's no difference to the fiscal position of the government whatsoever, which is why this is so dishonest. Just like when the government put forward legislation seeking to abolish the Building Australia Fund in order to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, it's just a ruse to avoid having the Building Australia Fund, which is an essential component of Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia was microeconomic reform that made a difference. It was reform allegedly supported by both sides, after they opposed it when it was passed in 2008. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole model was that Infrastructure Australia would make assessments of projects, including water infrastructure projects, and prioritise them and then governments would fund them through the Building Australia Fund. That's the model, to increase transparency, to stop people just saying, 'Well, I want to fund this because it's in a marginal seat.' Because of that rigour, there were projects like the Pacific Highway, $1.3 billion under the Howard government, $7.6 billion—under half the time—under the Rudd and Gillard governments. You know what? The Pacific Highway didn't run through a single electorate or voter who had a Labor member of the House of Representatives. The Nats did nothing about it. They were in safe National Party seats so they didn't worry about it. They didn't worry about Cowper or Lyne. It took a Labor government to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hunter Expressway is funded in the member for Hunter's electorate. I'll tell you the difference it makes to people in the agricultural sector. If you're a banana grower in the mid-North Coast you need to get your products to market. Road projects that involve freight, whether in the Hunter Valley connecting up with the New England Highway or the Pacific Highway, stack up. What you're saying, in doing this, is, 'Because it was a Labor government initiative, we will just seek to get rid of it.' It's out of—I'm not quite sure what the motivation is. You may as well get rid of Infrastructure Australia. There's no point in having an independent advisory body to the government on which projects to fund, if you haven't got a funding mechanism for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this is bad policy. It's just like you tried to say, 'If you don't support abolishing the BAF you don't support people with disabilities.' Now you're saying, 'If you don't support abolishing the BAF you don't support people in need of drought funding.' Neither of them are true. We have supported people with disabilities and supported the NDIS, but this is just a farce. To go through this process of playing politics just shows that this is a government without an agenda. You don't have an agenda, so you seek to come in here and—your backgrounding to journalists is the giveaway— seek to wedge Labor: 'We're going to make it a test for Labor.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what, to those opposite: the test is on you. You just got elected for your third term in office. You'd better get an agenda that's a bit bigger than, 'We're going to sit down and work out ways to wedge Labor,' because it won't be good enough. They'll be onto you, because that is all you're on about at the moment. All of the legislation before the parliament this week is about trying to play political games. Here's an idea for you: why don't you just try and govern properly? There's an idea. Just govern. Do what the people want you to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now you say this is urgent. It doesn't begin funding—$100 million; forget $5 billion. That's the other trick, these ridiculous figures. It's $100 million next July and $100 million the year after. That is all that will happen this term: $200 million. We're prepared to back that but we think you should do more. Bring it forward. Have a proper debate. Get some outcomes instead of some arguments.</span>

All that this House is asking for is a chance to be able to read legislation before we vote on it. All that this House is asking for is the opportunity—and, look, he wanders off now; let's not forget this is the same Prime Minister who's done it before. He's got form on this. Those of you who've been here for a couple of terms remember this Prime Minister coming in here with Treasury bills when there weren't enough copies here, when nobody knew what they were voting on and it was all meant to go through that night. He'd struck a deal with the Senate and he cared about his negotiation in the Senate but treated every member of this House with absolute contempt, and that's what's happening right now. </span>

The minister did not read out the whole motion. I have a written copy of the motion from the clerks. We are deciding a question now that has not in any way been said out loud to the parliament. If I may, I've already put the objections to the whole process tonight about the fact that we still don't have a copy of the bill that we're about to vote on, but—</span>

                  </a>  I'm working on the basis that, first of all, when a motion has to be provided in writing, it has to be the same as what was said out loud. I'm also working on the basis that, right now, members of parliament are not allowed to move because the doors have locked. The minister did not tell anyone that he was moving that the whole debate would be limited to 25 minutes. He did not tell anyone that there would be shortened speaking times within those 25 minutes, and yet that is the question that is now before the House.</span>

That section that he's referring to is never read out. It's not. I'm going to solve this very quickly. I realise that there are lots of arguments—and I think there will be no shortage of arguments tonight—but I'm going to make a prediction. If the Manager of Opposition Business has such a problem with the fact that, as I understand it—and you correct me if I'm wrong—the minister read out the section 'I move' and read out all of (a) and all of (b) but he didn't read out the time limits, one, it was without notice. If your point is you're concerned members didn't know that and they're about to vote, all right, I'll ask the minister to read out those time limits and, if necessary, if members want to shift, they can say that to me now.</span>

There is nothing happening now that doesn't happen all the time, and I'm happy to take that up with the member for Indi afterwards. Just so there's no misunderstanding, we're referring to the motion. The question that members are voting on is that the question be put; that's what members are voting on. If that question is carried, the question will then be on the motion moved by the minister, not on the bill. And if that is carried the minister will be able to introduce the bill.</span>

The government intends to grow the fund until it reaches $5 billion, while at the same time drawing down $100 million per year from 1 July 2020 to build drought resilience across Australia. Once established, the Future Drought Fund will provide a new secure, predictable revenue stream to build drought resilience across Australia. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  The high farce we have just seen in this House of Representatives over the course of the last, I'm not sure, maybe two hours is exactly what you can expect when the government of the day shows no respect for the parliament and its processes or, indeed, its conventions. I do want to thank the House staff who have to play catch-up and cover for government ministers when governments decide to break all the rules of the conventions for their own political gain. Surely, this government will take a lesson from what took place here this evening. Surely, it's a government now embarrassed by what some people, at least, in their homes will see, if not tonight, in their newspapers tomorrow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just let me make clear, for some of the newer members, what took place this afternoon. By convention, a bill is introduced and then it is adjourned. It is adjourned for a very important reason. It's so that members of the opposition and crossbenches can have the opportunity to study the bill, to better and properly understand what is in the bill. But while there was a draft bill up on the internet and available to those who asked, I don't know what the minister has tabled tonight. I can't be absolutely sure that what the minister tabled tonight and introduced into this House of Representatives, the national parliament, is what's on the website. I can't be sure that they are a replica. I'm now being asked to respond, on behalf of Her Majesty's opposition, to a proposition I can't be sure is the proposition which has been put to us in draft form. The point is, there are reasons we have these rules and conventions. Tonight they have been torn up, and the parliament is the poorer for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say, very genuinely, I felt sorry for the minister for drought this evening. I don't think he believed in what he was doing. I suspect he's as outraged as I am. When you saw him get a bit emotional, and there was a bit of moisture on the top lip, he wasn't reflecting on what's happening to our farmers in this drought-stricken land. I think he was embarrassed to have to stand there and lead the charge in this farce. He was no doubt even more embarrassed when the procedural sloppiness came to the fore. It was not necessarily his fault. He's a relatively new member who should not have been expected to drive this thing through as has been done tonight. But he will wear the embarrassment, and I've no doubt that will stay with him for some time to come.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People watching the debate over the substantive matters in this bill will be awash with information—claim and counterclaim: claim from the government that this is the most important thing the parliament will do this three years; claims that the opposition is just playing politics or posing for opposition's sake. They'll never be sure which is true. I can assure them that the opposition, as always, is attempting to act most responsibly. But when they see a little bit of what took place here tonight, I think they will come to a conclusion: all the evidence in their mind will be that the government hasn't come in here tonight in an attempt to give additional assistance to our drought-affected farmers but rather it came in to play a political game. It came in here to use as a wedge on the opposition one of the most pressing issues facing this country and an issue impacting very dramatically and adversely on our people in the food and fibre sector. Members of the government—no, not all of them; I'll check myself there. Those who are responsible for this tactic—and I suspect very strongly it goes to the top, the Prime Minister—should hang their heads in shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason this bill couldn't have been voted upon tomorrow or dealt with tomorrow. That would have given non-government members an opportunity to check this bill and further study it. It would have given the opposition the usual opportunity to go through its party processes tomorrow—the shadow cabinet, the caucus committee, the caucus—as is the usual course of things. Why are we being denied that process? I fell for the minister when he was trying to argue that it would make some difference if this was dealt with tomorrow rather than tonight. He doesn't believe that, and I have no doubt that no-one listening to the debate tonight believes that. It is just farcical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a policy initiative—not a very good one—announced in October last year, when the Prime Minister, devoid of anything else to say, decided to have a drought summit. We all knew that that drought summit would be nothing but a talkfest. In the absence of anything else to say, the Prime Minister turned up on the morning of the summit and, before a word was spoken, announced this so-called $5 billion Drought Future Fund. So much for the drought summit! It seems the Prime Minister wasn't the least bit interested in what people were going to say at the summit. He'd already made up his mind. His little scheme was to steal $3.9 billion out of the Building Australia Fund, a fund so critical to rural and regional Australia. The Leader of the Opposition gave some very good examples tonight of the good work it has done, including happily in my electorate of Hunter. His plan is to raid that fund and put it into this new Drought Future Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why? No-one has been able to tell the opposition why. In Dubbo last week, the Leader of the Opposition effectively appealed to the Prime Minister to rethink his approach. He did something I've not seen an opposition leader do before. He said, 'We will back the expenditure, the appropriation, of any amount necessary to do what we need to do for our drought-affected farmers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a pretty generous offer. But was it embraced by the Prime Minister? No. And why not? Well, there are three reasons. One is that it would deny the Prime Minister the $5 billion headline, as farcical as that is. That works in the media, and he knows it. He's only spending $100 million a year—that's the truth of it—and not until 2020-21, but he wants them to see the $5 billion headline. The other reason is that this government doesn't like the guidance of Infrastructure Australia—the discipline that brings to government. It doesn't like the fact that under a Labor government we got rid of the pork-barrelling and said that in future these major projects would be funded out of the BAF, but only on the guidance of Infrastructure Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister doesn't like that discipline. He wants to make his own decisions about where money is spent, and we will see evidence of that in the coming three years—no doubt about that. The last reason, of course, is that it would have denied him the wedge that we've been dealing with here this evening. This is the centrepiece of this Prime Minister's week. He went to an election promising to do nothing, that nothing would change, and that looks like exactly what he's going to do. At least he's going to keep that promise. It's the true definition of conservatism—opposition to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in the absence of anything meaningful to say, he's going to just play the wedge and look for an opportunity every day to, I suppose, politically embarrass, pressure or challenge the opposition. The opposition leader made this point tonight. When those sitting opposite say, 'This bill will test the opposition', we know what that means. It means that this bill and this process is designed to wedge the opposition. There's not much thought about our farmers going on there. The Prime Minister's only thoughts are on those who sit on this side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said on Radio National this morning that this parliament is not divided into two groups—those who support doing everything we can for our drought-affected farmers and those who do not support doing everything we can for our drought-affected farmers. No, we are not divided on that front. I don't believe there is a member in this parliament, MP or senator, who doesn't support doing everything we possibly can for the producers of our food and flavour in these most difficult times. And I find it offensive, quite frankly, that this Prime Minister and those who sit with him attempt to suggest otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past six years I've been offering bipartisanship in the agriculture sector. It has not always been easy, I have to say, to keep your head down when a government is performing so hopelessly in the portfolio you speak for on the opposition benches. There was a two-year wait for an agriculture white paper that has completely ignored climate change and pretty much ignored drought. I do wonder whether those who are close to that process now are asking themselves whether they made a mistake in not making drought and a change in climate a centrepiece of that agriculture white paper, but they did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We weathered the decision to abolish the COAG committee charged with further progressing drought reform. Think about that; the government abolished the COAG committee—the ministerial meeting of the Commonwealth and state agriculture ministers—and they boasted about the saving they made at the time. We waited patiently for the review of the intergovernmental agreement on drought reform—and patient indeed we had to be. We suffered the folly of what is, in part, the centrepiece of the policy position tonight, the bill: the establishment of the Regional Investment Corporation—a boondoggle, a pork-barrelling exercise designed only to shore up votes in Orange, where the National Party lost a state seat for the first time in something like 69 years. The RIC is designed to do only two things: administer some concessional loans for farmers—something that was already being done by state rural adjustment authorities—and administer water infrastructure loans. If you check, it hasn't done too much of that. Now the government wants to us to believe that this bill has integrity because the minister can't do anything unless it's effectively ticked off by the Regional Investment Corporation. At least they've found them something to do, because we know that, on the basis of the loans they've lent, they're not doing much. They're not doing much at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is this really accountability? Think about it. Who appoints the chair and the members of the Regional Investment Corporation? The minister, of course, makes those appointments. So the minister wants us to believe that the way in which the $100 million a year will be spent will have integrity and accountability because it's run by the RIC, the very people the minister appoints. Of course it won't. It's a farce. We had the drought envoy, the drought coordinator, the drought taskforce and the Drought Summit. Now we have a joint select committee looking at drought. I thought we had a joint select committee last parliament on regional Australia which, given the state of the environment now, might have spent some time talking about drought. Does the Prime Minister really need a select committee to tell him, six years into office, what's happening out there and how the government might respond? It bodes the question: why are we doing the policy before the select committee does its work? It's an interesting question in itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more positive note, I welcomed the change in language from the minister for drought and occasionally from other senior ministers—even the Prime Minister. I stand corrected possibly, but I even thought I heard the Prime Minister, in Dubbo last week, talk about the additional moisture you can hold in soil as a result of an increase in the carbon content of that soil. Wow! If he said that, that is a development. That is something very, very new from this very conservative Prime Minister, who I suspect, in his quiet moments, doesn't really believe that there's any point in a government acting on climate change. Minister Littleproud has been quite expansive in his comments about resilience, adaption, soil health et cetera. Sometimes I listen to him and I think I'm listening to myself from the last parliament. It's not something I would have heard from any minister on that side even a year ago. That's a good development because we do want to work with the government, because our farmers will be best served if we are all working together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Language is easy; words are cheap. What really matters is action. The six years that have just passed give me no confidence whatsoever that those words will be turned into meaningful action. I have no confidence that they'll seriously start talking about carbon mitigation and I have no confidence they'll continue to talk seriously about climate adaption. I fear that, once this process is put in place, for the next three years they'll say, 'That job is done.' We should never say $100 million is not a lot of money. One hundred million dollars is a lot of money in anybody's language. However, given the scale of the challenge we face with the ongoing drought—the longest, hottest, driest drought we've had in many regions—it will take a lot more money than that. I say to Australians listening: 'Because the Prime Minister has created a fund which is going to give a magic amount of money to farmers—something sufficient to address this problem—don't believe it. It's not true.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been meaning to check the fact today, but I am very confident that if you go back to the 1992 Productivity Commission report you will find some numbers there that show we were spending more money on drought in 2007-08 than the government is spending now. Watch the clever accounting, because this is a government which loves counting the capital value of loans when it talks about what it's spending on drought. When the government borrows at the bond rate and lends money at something greater than the bond rate that is not spending money on drought; that is creating a headline, and that's what this government does consistently—headlines on concessional loans, headlines on the Future Drought Fund and headlines on the Water Infrastructure Development Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, these loans are designed to fail. This government doesn't want those loans taken up, but the headline figure looks really, really good. The minister boasted about the additional transparency and accountability measures that were put in place by the former member for Indi with the support of the opposition benches. What an extraordinary thing to boast about. It is an admission that the original bill was lacking in accountability and transparency, and the minister wants us to pat him on the back for being forced into putting in those additional integrity measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a long history here. I mentioned that in 2008 there was a historic Productivity Commission review into drought. Then something else more historic happened, all of the states in the Commonwealth, the National Farmer's Federation and the key leadership groups agreed that all the drought measures, which were in place at the time, needed to go. They were inefficient. It was a moral hazard. They were costing lots and lots of money with what it seemed was very little effect. That is a historic agreement. The job of government from that point was to progress and develop a new drought plan. The agreement established six objectives on which that plan should be developed. But, again, soon after their election in 2013, this government abolished the COAG process. It has been restored in a sense now but all those years have been lost. We have to remember that whatever the parliament does this week on this drought bill it is not going to make a jot of difference. Not one bit of help will go to a farmer, not next week, not next month and not even next year. The $100 million drawdown begins in the 2021 period. Goodness knows how long after that the money will be spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan the minister was talking about tonight should have commenced six years ago. That is a matter of great regret for all of us who sit on this side. And I have no doubt that it is a matter of regret for all who are working the land in this country, who are so adversely affected by the extreme and current drought, which, by the way, sadly, shows no sign of abatement. Sadly, I've not seen any report from any scientist, the BOM or anyone else, which suggests that that's going to change any time soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand ready to do all that we can to work with the government to catch up and catch up we must because six years is a long time to wait. I do think that we are finally starting to agree that income support for farmers—which has been a farce too under this government, that's incontestable—is important. The accelerated depreciation is important for water efficiency, fodder, storage et cetera—and I do note that the government has done some effective things there, and I welcome that. But the whole basis of our approach has to be on long-term productivity and sustainable profitability, and the basis of that is an acknowledgement that the climate is changing. And instead of wasting time on what is changing it, we've got to mitigate against it and we've got to help our farmers adapt to what is a changed climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a lot of work to do helping many farmers change their practices, improve the health of their soil and improve their water efficiency in terms of both soil moisture and storage on farm. We need to do more on research and development. The minister, I'm reliably advised, spent $2.3 million just prior to the election to tell us everything we know about what's wrong with our research, development and innovation system, but here we are, and I've not heard anyone from the government mention it this parliament. It was just $2.3 million to tell us what we already knew about what is wrong with the innovation system, but the silence from that side is deafening. There is a reference in the bill to innovation. Then again, words are cheap. We need action from this government. We've got, as I said, a lot of time to make up now. The action needs to start now. My final message tonight is a reminder that, sadly, there is nothing in this bill that's going to help farmers for the next 12 months and probably a period beyond that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  The amendment is seconded. In speaking on the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019 and in particular on the second reading amendment, I want to make clear what has happened in the parliament in the last half an hour or so. This debate that we are having today is about a bill to set up a fund that won't see a single dollar flow to farmers until the 2020-21 financial year. And it's not going to be an amount of $5 billion flowing to farmers. It's not even going to be the $3.9 billion flowing to farmers for drought. It's $100 million in the 2020-21 financial year and $100 million in the following financial year. It's $200 million. That is what this debate is about. This debate is about $200 million going to farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no doubt that the Australian Labor Party supports $200 million going to our drought-affected farmers. In fact, we have said that these farmers need help now. They need help today. They can't wait for another 12 months. In fact, they have already been waiting the six years during which this government has not taken action to actually try and provide relief and started to look at the infrastructure that is needed to ensure that these droughts are not continuing to affect so many of our communities into the future. That's what this bill, at the crux of it, is actually about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has, of course, decided to trash procedure in this place by introducing this bill and debating it immediately—having not introduced it in a previous sitting period of parliament where 26 or so bills were introduced in the Senate—but also by not according the opposition, members of their own backbench, our backbench and the crossbench the opportunity to actually look at this bill properly. From the outset, I want to say that Labor does support all and any actions being taken to support drought-affected farmers and, of course, the communities surrounding them. As a very proud regional Australian and as someone who travels extensively throughout rural communities across this country, I have seen the effects of this drought firsthand, and I have been devastated, frankly, by the lack of action that this government has taken over the past six years. There is absolutely no reason that the government cannot make an appropriation for drought funding now. We're talking about $200 million in the term of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason at all that the government couldn't make that appropriation now. In fact, doing so would have the same budgetary impact that drawing down on the Building Australia Fund would have. So there's no difference in terms of the impact on the budget. They could've done so anytime during the past six years. They did not. We stand ready to support them if they do, and not only $200 million—we've said, 'If you want more then we stand ready to support that.' That's pretty unprecedented in this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we think action does need to be taken now to alleviate the social and economic costs in drought-affected communities. A strategic plan should have been developed—not just in the next 12 months, which is partly what this bill says is going to happen; it should have been done over the past six years. It needs to be done transparently and on the basis of science and the best available advice to government as to what will work. And that is partly the problem with this bill. The government is not serious about tackling drought. It is seeking to politicise the plight of drought-affected communities to do what it has been trying to do since it got elected: get its hands on the Building Australia Fund, a fund that has a fair bit of rigour around what it can fund, including funding infrastructure projects in regional communities. What this government wants to do is basically open it up for ministerial discretion. That is what this bill is about. It's not about drought. This underhanded attempt by the government to play politics with drought as a means to get rid of the Building Australia Fund is dressing it up as trying to do something about drought in 2021. That's what those opposite are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the first time that the government has tried to dismantle the Building Australia Fund. Since being elected three terms ago, the government has tried on four separate occasions to dismantle it. The BAF was established in 2008 under the Nation-building Funds Act. The purpose of this fund is to finance capital investment in transport infrastructure—roads, rail, urban transport and ports; communications infrastructure, such as broadband; energy infrastructure, desperately needed; and, of course, water infrastructure. We established the fund to try and stop some of the political pork-barrelling, frankly, that had happened under previous governments, to try and take infrastructure funding out of the political cycle that we see, where some communities benefit and many communities do not. It was about taking the politics out of infrastructure funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Nation-building Funds Act, criteria were developed which must be applied by Infrastructure Australia before projects can be recommended for funding, and the criteria are set on four important principles. I think it is important to take some time to reflect on the extent of rigour that was built into the Building Australia Fund as a way to ensure that the funds were spent appropriately and that they delivered best value to the Australian public, free of political interference. This is particularly important at a time when the Reserve Bank is highlighting the need for infrastructure spending to support Australia's flagging economy. The opposition believes that the Building Australia Fund could be used in these current economic conditions to help stimulate and support the very communities that are affected by drought. Instead the government is seeking to take $3.9 billion—and frankly it does not make sense that they are not drawing down on the Building Australia Fund now for projects that have been recommended by Infrastructure Australia to get investment into the economy now in communities across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fund is based on four key principles. Principle 1 is that projects should address national infrastructure priorities. Under this principle, projects need to demonstrate a positive impact on national productivity and on economic growth. Principle 2 is that projects should demonstrate high benefits and effective use of resources. Under this principle, projects must stand up on their own merits and be justified on the basis of evidence and data. Principle 3 is that projects should effectively address infrastructure needs. This principle seeks to ensure that projects are delivered efficiently and that they are able to leverage co-investment where possible. Principle 4 is that projects should demonstrate that they achieve established standards in implementation and management, and the project goes to risk—in particular, this principle goes to risk—against ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent in an open, transparent and efficient way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These principles demonstrate why the Building Australia Fund was set up by the former Labor government and they demonstrate exactly why the government hate it. They want to get their hands on this money with ministerial discretion to do what they want in their communities without actually having any proper rigour in the process. What I note in particular, I know that the crossbench and the former member for Indi worked with us to try and put—where we thought we wouldn't obviously have the numbers to do what we wanted to do with this bill—some rigour into the process, and I acknowledge that the government has attempted to do that. But I've seen this playbook before. I've seen it with the Medical Research Future Fund, where medical researcher after medical researcher, including some who are on the government's own advisory panel, will come to me—and I'm sure they're now coming to the shadow minister for health, Chris Bowen—to tell us that they are extremely concerned about the lack of transparency, the lack of any proper application process and the lack of any peer review for projects and government decision-making that surrounds the Medical Research Future Fund. So, I caution those crossbenchers who think that, by having an advisory committee and the requirement that there be a plan into this legislation, that will somehow stop what we know this government does time after time after time—pick pet projects in the seats that it wants to target, that it is interested in, and not actually looking at where regional communities need assistance with drought and doing something about that equally across communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I caution the crossbenchers very strongly that I have seen this playbook before. This bill, the establishment of the Drought Future Fund and the way in which the government has set up advisory committees and requirements around a plan does nothing. At the end of the day, this is a bill that enshrines ministerial discretion in the way this fund will be spent. And that is what the government will do. And that is what the minister will do, and there will potentially be very little rigour. That is what the government is proposing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was important when we set up the Building Australia Fund to take the politics out of decisions relating to infrastructure. It was critical for the economy and it was particularly critical for many National Party seats that had projects funded. They included things like the Pacific Highway in New South Wales, the Ipswich Motorway in Queensland and the Regional Rail Link in Victoria that my seat, the seat of Corio, the seat of Corangamite and the seat of Bendigo absolutely benefit from improving regional rail infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Australia Fund was not a political slush fund, and that's exactly the government's problem with it. It was a major economic reform. It was a sensible, transparent means of allocating scarce resources to achieve maximum benefit to the community. Labor supports the government in addressing the impacts of drought on farmers and on regional communities. We've supported all recent and immediate drought measures put forward by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, including the additional supplementary farm household allowance; increasing the farm household allowance extension from three to four years; increasing the farm assets threshold from $2.6 million to $5 million; and increasing the farm management deposit scheme to $800,000. That's what we have supported, and we're also saying we're willing to support further appropriations for drought funding for sensible infrastructure projects to mitigate against drought. However, this bill is not doing that. It doesn't put any money onto the table until the 2020-21 financial year, some 11 months away. If the government was serious about assisting our farmers, real money would be on the table now. The Building Australia Fund would not have been left to sit idle, frankly, for six years, not drawing down on the dividends—you have to actually go and ask them for a dividend if you want to do that; the government doesn't appear to have even realised that it needs to do that to get one—to fund projects. And without it being able to do that, it creates significant problems for regional communities going forward. The government needs to develop a proper plan, as it should have done during its six years so far in government, to help drought-affected farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Droughts are a reality of life in many parts of regional Australia and have been for a long time. The government has had plenty of opportunity to bring forward real funding to support farmers and their communities, but under these bills farmers in regional communities have to wait until at least 1 July 2020 for any of these funds to be able to flow. Not a cent will be flowing next week, or next month or in fact even in the next year. Sadly, action is needed now if many of our drought-affected communities are to survive. I note that the government, as I said, claims that they're going to establish consultative committees around this bill. But, again, I say to the crossbench; be very careful with what you wish for when it comes to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we say to the government that we stand ready and willing to support bringing forward appropriations for our drought-affected communities. But the abolition of the Building Australia Fund will hurt regional and rural communities. I don't think many of the regional MPs have really thought through the implications of abolishing this fund and what that will mean for the future funding of infrastructure. That is why the member for Hunter and I have moved the second reading amendment, and I commend that amendment to the House.</span>

We have to be very careful, when it comes to the Labor Party, not to listen to what they say but to look at what they do and look at what they did in the lead-up to the election when they thought they were going to be the incoming government post 18 May. They were the ones who then were shaping water policy—you would not believe this—to actually make it worse than it was for our drought-affected farmers. This is the most incredibly heartless series of policies that were put out there in the months leading up to the election. As if our dairy farmers and our croppers and our horticulturists were already without enough water to run their businesses, here was the Labor Party putting out this policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is totally disingenuous of the Labor Party to say that talk about the bill we're passing is offensive. What we really have to look at is what really matters: the actions of a political party. The Labor Party, in the lead-up to the last election, brought out some of the most horrendous actions. What they showed the Australian farmers, what they showed the people who were needing more, cheaper water, was that all of their policies were directed towards making the cost of water more expensive, more unaffordable than what it already was. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As farmers were walking off their farms, as suspected farmers were committing suicide, here was the Labor Party putting out its water policies to take to the elections, which were all about taking more water out of agriculture for the environment. They were making the problem worse. They were making the heartfelt pain, agony and sorrow of our farmers worse, and deliberately making it worse. They were not making it worse for something inconsequential: 'We're trying to help the dairy farmers so we're going to make it harder on the horticulturists.' No, they're just making it harder on all of the farmers up and down the Murray-Darling Basin network. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the Labor Party did. This is what they set their sights on achieving—making all the agony associated with having to walk off your farm, walk into a situation where you're going to be bankrupt for five years, where you can't pay your bills and you can't afford to buy a house. You can't do anything. You're on the verge of a total mental breakdown. The Labor Party thought this was a good group of Australians to go after. This was a good group of Australians to make it harder for them to get ahead, to live their lives. This is a good group they can inflict some more pain on by water policies that are all in favour of the fish populations, up and down the Murray-Darling Basin, but they're not too happy to associate and assist with any of the 2.3 million people living up and down the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>

                    </a>  This totally disingenuous policy was put forward by the Labor Party, turning their backs on our farmers. They're also making out that because this money is not arriving now, this money is not arriving next month, we're doing nothing for our drought-affected farmers. Yes, we are, with our farm household allowance, with our low-interest concessional loans, with the encouragement into the farm management deposits scheme. There are a whole raft of initiatives from this government that assist drought-affected farmers. And, yes, we need to do more, but we need to do more in their favour, not make their lives worse, which is where the Labor Party ended up going. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $3.9 million Future Drought Fund is to generate $100 million for each and every year that the fund exists. That's what we're doing for the long term. Yes, we have our immediate plans that are ready to go right now. So, when our farmers are in trouble and they need assistance, we've got our farm household allowance and we've got low-interest loans. Together, they can total over $50,000 per annum. What we're trying to do is keep that in place but also build on resilience for the future. How do you do that? What are the types of projects that we might do into the future that are going to build on this resilience within the agricultural sector?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, right now, many of the horticulturalists around the Goulburn Valley are talking about a netting program to be able to shield their fruit from the extreme heat throughout the summer. This has been seen to increase the production of fruit and protect it from hail, birds and insects, but it also increases productivity and uses less water. We also see virtual fencing programs. Yes, they cost money, but they mean that farmers can effectively chew down their pastures at a rate that suits them, rather than losing those pastures in one great go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater carbon levels need to be held in soils, as reported by Major General the Hon. Michael Jeffery, and we are investing $2 million to make sure of that. These carbon projects also cost money to get up and running, but they can be great earners for our farmers as well. As I say, many of our farmers are in fact early adopters when it comes to many of these programs. So, while we are helping our farmers right now, this $100 million will be built on each and every year into the future—therefore, building greater sustainability and greater resilience—putting in place some real changes that mean we're going to be able to take that industry considerably further forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also really interesting and worth looking at what some of the early adopters among our farmers, who are some of the best environmentalists in Australia, are actually doing with their farms. They are using great amounts of compost—again, to retain more moisture, more water, within the soil. No-till farming, or zero tillage, has now revolutionised the whole cropping industry, again making sure crop production increases, but using less water. We're also seeing on-farm efficiency programs—spending millions of dollars increasing productivity and decreasing water use. That's happened throughout the Goulburn Valley, and water efficiency programs will continue to spread right through New South Wales. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Science has played a big role in agriculture—using less water, learning how to stress your plants and then hit them with a quick rush on laser-graded paddocks, There are many more water-efficiency programs out there, but all of them cost money. They are expensive, and they're going to need some assistance from government into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dairy industry is moving heavily into corn and maize as a way of turning dry matter into milk productivity. This is something that, again, is going to see the average dairy farmer becoming able to stay in the water market beyond the term of maybe $180 per megalitre up towards $220 and way beyond that. If you have a barn-style concrete feed pad and you're looking at moving into maize and corn, you may be able to stay in the market and pay up to $400 a megalitre for water if you can generate your feed systems in a way that is going to take advantage of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these barn-style feed pads and these rotary dairies are incredibly expensive. The early adapters are going to move into this space. Some of the bigger family and corporate farms are going to need some assistance from government. This is where this fund, into the future, is going to be able to play a major role in assisting these farmers to be those early adapters and to be those farmers who move into a new way of milk production or horticulture, with increased productivity and less water reliance. They will be able to pay more and be able to complete with some of the commodities that, at the moment, can pay $500 and $600 per megalitre for their water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers might not be perfect; but when they were kneeling at the altar we didn't come up behind them, take a knife to their throats and effectively try to finish them off the way that the Labor Party has threatened to do. In the lead-up to the last election, the Labor Party threatened to bring back buybacks. We all know that that is the most inefficient, lazy, dangerous and detrimental water policy program you could ever have. The Labor Party were going right down the path of water buybacks. The Labor Party were going to push ahead with the $450, taking more water out of agriculture to go into the environment. This was right at the time when the dairy industry and the horticultural industry were crying out for some of that environmental water to maybe be lent back to agricultural in dry days, in the way of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan that was put forward by John Howard. It never got designed in that manner. Unfortunately, we now have environment being the biggest holder of water. They have no capacity and no want to actually assist with helping our agricultural sector through this drought. That is because they have their own objectives that they want to meet.</span>

                    </a>  For his information, the party that he belongs to is the child of the Country Party. The Country Party was formed by Jack McEwen, who formed the Milk Marketing Board in Victoria. When he says it can't be done, the founder of his political party did it. It is a very famous story, which bears telling. He was only 28 years of age. He was actually a city boy, but he loved the country and he just went bush. He called a meeting of all of the dairy farmers in Victoria. He said he was sick of sitting on a dirt floor, eating rabbits in a galvanised iron shed, and that from now all the milk would be sold through a milk marketing board, called a cooperative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a few big farmers—and obviously this bloke here would be representative of them—and they disagreed with him. Jack McEwen said he had to explain it to them privately. He kept the meeting going. He took them out the back of the meeting, and he belted the living daylights out of all three of them. He then came back in and said, 'Does anyone else want it explained to them? I'm quite happy to explain it properly to all of you if need be.' From that moment forward, he was called Black Jack McEwen. We got our dairy marketing plan. We stopped living on dirt floors, thanks to the likes of this fellow. We stopped living in a galvanised iron shed and eating rats because somebody said, 'We can get a decent price for our product, if we pull together and sell it as a unit.' That was called statutory marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation of the Country Party was statutory marketing. It was formed to deliver statutory marketing in wheat in Western Australia. At the meeting, after the single-desk seller for wheat concluded, no-one left the room and they then pulled themselves into a meeting to form a political party to deliver statutory marketing in the wheat industry. This fellow here knows nothing. This fellow here says you can't have it. We had it for 100 years, but he says you can't have it. We had it for 100 years.</span>

The House carried the motion by the minister for drought that all the standing orders that would get in the way of this debate occurring be automatically suspended and that could be varied by a motion moved by a minister. What the minister has just done is activate standing order 31(c)(ii). Standing order 31(c)(ii)—and he has activated it accurately—says that if a minister requires the question to be put immediately as proposed under paragraph (a) then that would happen. </span>

The Deputy Speaker cannot propose a motion that would vary the arrangements that we have. If this were allowed then for the rest of the night I would be allowed, for example, to move that the debate be adjourned, to move to suspend the standing orders and to move a whole lot of things that would be completely inconsistent with the resolution.</span>

                </a>  Mr Deputy Speaker, the difficulty with that argument is that this motion is simply to extend the sittings of the House. It does not vary the motion that the minister put before the House. That motion is a permissive motion that says for the purposes of 'a cognate debate to occur, and passage of both bills through all stages today, without delay at any stage'. So this is a standard motion that is proposed by the speaker and, as the member opposite noted, the moving of the motion to allow for a vote on the question that the House do now adjourn was appropriately moved by me in this position.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I want to thank the opposition for their attempt to give me 15 minutes tomorrow, and I thank the government for giving me 12 minutes tonight. I remain confused. I can tell you the previous speaker from Victoria—the dairying state—did not know that it was his state that instituted milk marketing and it worked there for nearly 100 years. That's an exaggeration; it was about 70 years. Mr Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, deregulated the milk market into Melbourne, so that all they could get in Victoria was the world price for milk. Did people get cheaper milk in Melbourne? No, of course they didn't. Woolworths and Coles sold it at almost the same price, so they achieved absolutely nothing in terms of consumer benefit, but what happened to the farmers? They went down on their knees. But because they were getting around 40c and New South Wales and Queensland were getting 60c, they said, 'Righto, we want this whole minimum price scheme abolished so we can go across the border and get 60c.' They went across the border and they didn't even get 40c because they were in a deregulated marketplace. And a deregulated marketplace where there are only two buyers—effectively, the two supermarket giants—is what I was taught at university is an oligopoly or a duopoly. It's very, very bad indeed for the sellers, and, of course, it's not very good for the people they sell to either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we had Mr McEwen, the founder of the Country Party, establishing the milk marketing scheme for Australia and here is his so-called follower standing in this place and saying, 'It'll never work,' after it worked for 70 years. The only reason it stopped working was that Mr Kennett deregulated the milk market into Melbourne, and it's extraordinary to me that a person out of Victoria would not know this. Then they wanted to come across the border. Of course, having had their own industry destroyed, they wanted to destroy ours. They had the numbers and they voted for deregulation. The rest of us and my area were on 59c the day before deregulation and we were on 41c the day after. We had around 230 or 240 dairy farmers before the deregulation was announced. After the deregulation, within about 10 years, we had 39 farmers. I'll repeat that slowly. We had 240 farmers all making a good living. After deregulation, we had 39 farmers. And a lot of those people exited the industry in the most tragic way possible, of course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, who is to blame for this? Is it the dairy farmers? Have they done anything wrong? Is it the people that were buying the milk—have they done anything wrong? Is it Woolworths and Coles who were trying to maximise profits for their shareholders? No, they've done nothing wrong. So, who's got it wrong? The government of Australia, the government of Victoria and the government of Queensland—they've got it wrong. They were the ones that did it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only bad guys in this are the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and, to their eternal shame, the National Party. Jack McEwen would turn in his grave. Doug Anthony, whose daddy did exactly the same with the bananas, would turn in his grave if he thought the party that they created and established was now the party of deregulation, smashing to pieces the great edifices that were built. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in a state of shock when the Labor Party moved from the price scheme because they'd been anything but innocent in this deregulation. Whilst Mr McEwen was the father of statutory marketing, Mr Keating was the father of the destruction of statutory marketing and the destruction of agriculture in this nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here to talk about drought, and there seems to be an element of hypocrisy if you represent anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin because it's totally represented by the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party who all voted for a 28 per cent reduction in the water. I hope that, if in my area I voted for a 28 per cent reduction in the water in the Mareeba irrigation area, they would tar and feather me, and hang me. I hope that would happen, but it would never happen so long as I've got breath in my soul. I'd never sell my people out and destroy them to please a bunch of ratbag greenies, destroying the people who created this country and the greatness of this country, and who wouldn't know a tree from a billy goat. None of them would know a tree from a billy goat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the Murray-Darling cutbacks: in Victoria they claim, 'Oh, if we reinstituted the Murray scheme, it would only really help those people selling fresh milk in the fresh milk market.' Well, the average Victorian farmer for that 20 per cent that goes into the fresh milk market was worth $140,000 per farmer per year if it was restored—if there was a McEwen or a Doug Anthony out there, it would have been restored. God help the Liberal Party who tried to destroy any of those marketing schemes that saw us get prosperity in the sugar industry, prosperity in the dairy industry, prosperity in the egg industry, and we've watched the complete destruction of agriculture in this country to a point where most of the last 15 years we've been a net importer of fruit and vegetables. You have that galoot who is leading the National Party in this place, wandering around with his hat on saying, 'Oh, we will be the food bowl of Asia.' Listen, imbecile, you will be the begging bowl of Asia. If you can't market aggressively—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KATTER:</span>
                    </a>  I withdraw that remark, Mr Deputy Speaker. We're talking about drought. I mean, there's one answer to drought—only one answer to drought—and that is to get some water, put it on the ground and grow some grass. I'm going to emphasise here the grazing industry rather than the cropping industry. So, the only answer to drought, which scourged this country as we know for 200 years—and I suspect for 20,000 or 30,000 years—is to put some water on the ground to make grass grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only place we have a reliable water supply is north of the line, and the Prime Minister of Australia said, 'Where is the line?' I said, 'From Tennant Creek through Mount Isa to Charters Towers and Mackay. North of that line your rivers and creeks run every year.' I speak with great authority because my own family has lived on the Cloncurry River, some 400 or 500 kilometres from the sea, for 130 years that I know of. Judging from my dark complexion, I suspect a hell of a lot longer—and I'm very proud of the fact too. It has run every single year in white man's history—400 kilometres—and our annual rainfall is 14 inches in Cloncurry. But, because it all comes within a month or two months, the river runs every year. Every year we get the monsoons. Every year our rivers and creeks run. Every single one of them runs. For a large proportion of my life, I owned 250,000 acres of North Queensland, and with a partner we owned 500,000 acres, and the rivers and creeks ran every single year. So all you have to do is just hold a little bit of that water back—because that's all you can hold back with the vast floods that we have every year—spread it out and grow grass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in my life I see—sorry, I take that back because the much-maligned Malcolm Fraser government and the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government launched the great and visionary Bradfield Scheme to turn inland Australia into 'a garden of flowers'. That was the expression that John Crew Bradfield used to describe what was going to happen in Central Australia. Please, God, if Hells Gates is built the way it should be built, that's Bradfield stage 1. But today we stand up and say to the government: 'Hold a little bit of that water back.' We're not farmers; we're cattlemen. Cattle walk around on the grass and they eat the grass. That's what we're going to do. If you have a bad drought, it will pay us not to have the cattle walking around and eating the grass. We'll cut the grass and feed it in troughs and we can carry 20 times more cattle. If your cattle or your sheep are hungry, send them up to us in the bad times, because it will pay us to cut the grass and trough-feed the cattle. There is your answer to drought. When it rains back in New South Wales, you take them back home again. So we have the answers. If North Queensland were a separate country, it would be the wettest country on earth—wetter than Brazil or any other country. We have miles of water, but the trouble is we don't have rivers. We have a flood and then we have a series of waterholes. All we're saying is: harvest a little bit of the flood and hold it back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the reconstruction board on debt, my son, the member of parliament for North-West Queensland, in the state parliament, headed the committee that went all over the state. I went to four of those meetings. At every meeting, every farmer stood up and said, 'We want no more debt.' I speak with authority because I was the minister responsible for the state bank in Queensland. We borrowed about $700 million. We borrowed it at about two or three per cent and we loaned it to farmers at two or three per cent. It didn't cost anything. We just got the interest from them and paid it to the banks. We borrowed the money; we took the mortgages. This is the critical point: we took the mortgages. We were not prepared to risk the taxpayers' money. We took the mortgages. So, if they went broke, we foreclosed, and we did foreclose on about five per cent of them. We brought the entire sugar industry through. Not only did we not lose money but we made about $200 million profit because, three years later, the price went up, as it always does. It's cyclical as in other industries. We went back to 8½ per cent interest and we made about $200 million out of it. The government will not go to a reconstruction board approach, which puts no government money in jeopardy. The farmer, who might owe a million dollars and pays $80,000 a year in interest and repayments is suddenly paying $10,000, and he can get through. With a family assistance package, the good ones can get through. The bad ones should be out of the industry anyway. That's what happened.</span>

Drought relief and dealing with the devastating effects of drought is the top priority of our electorate of Calare in the Central West of New South Wales. Backing our agricultural sector is vital for Australia's economic future and vital for Australia's food security. This bill is all about backing the future of agriculture in Australia. It will help build resilience in the farming sector. It will help farmers recover from drought but also build preparedness and resilience for future droughts. It will grow to be a $5 billion fund with $100 million drawn down every year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because this bill is so important to the future of agriculture in this country, I am astounded that the opposition continues to oppose it. They are playing politics with it. We have heard from the farming organisations, like the NFF, and we have heard from local farmers. They want this bill passed into law, and they want the politics taken out of it. I ask those opposite: haven't you learnt anything from the recent federal election? You can dress it up anyway you like, but at the end of the day you are opposing drought relief for stressed farmers all over New South Wales and all over Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition went to the last poll opposing drought relief for farmers. They opposed decentralisation, like moving the Regional Investment Corporation to Orange; opposed concessional loans to farmers and opposed water infrastructure for farmers. They went along with the ACTU's proposal to scrap, abolish and dismantle the working holiday visa scheme. They tried to steal the retirement savings from retired farmers and retirees all over Australia. All of it was rejected at the polls. This government took this policy to the polls. It was the policy of building this Future Drought Fund to help prepare our farmers and country communities for future drought. There is a mandate for it, and it should be respected by the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the issue here is that those opposite have been playing to the inner Green constituency. They have lost focus on what they are here for and who they are supposed to be representing. They have betrayed working families, they have betrayed farmers, they have betrayed miners and they have betrayed workers, retirees and aspirational investors. In fact, they have offended and betrayed just about everyone in the regions in some way. They insulted country communities by opposing this bill before the election and they insult country communities now by their continued opposition to it and the playing of petty politics. If you want an example of pretty politics, you only have to look at the amendments moved by the member for Hunter. So juvenile are they in nature that it says everything that you need to know about the opposition and the fact that they have learnt nothing from this election. The member for Hunter should know better after what happened in his seat. Those opposite have insulted country communities. They have insulted farming communities, farmers and businesses all over country Australia. They continue to do that now by their opposition to and the playing of petty politics with such an important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my inaugural speech, I spoke about the great divide between the city and the bush, which exists in so many ways. The opposition continues to feed that great divide and the ignorance of what lies beyond the Great Dividing Range. Their opposition to this bill sends the message that that side of politics doesn't support farmers or drought relief. It sends a terrible message to the rest of Australia, and it feeds the ignorance. It feeds the great divide. It feeds the ignorance that nourishes the vegan activists and the farm invasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when this bill came before the House in February that it was the member for Hunter who told farmers all over Australia that they needed to be surfing the currents of activism. Again, that was a betrayal of the people of the bush. That is evidence that those opposite have lost focus of who they are supposed to be representing and what they are supposed to be doing here. People in country Australia want results. They need help. They need relief from this drought. I say to those opposite: stop playing the petty politics, lift the debate and support this bill. Let's do something together.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad reality is that there are huge numbers of people who live in cities and have no idea where their food comes from. They think that produce just magically appears on the shelves of supermarkets, and little thought is given to the hard work of those who put it there and make it happen. This is a time when the whole parliament needs to unite on such a vital national issue. We all need to be standing with farmers in a united, national show of support. Yet, when given the opportunity, those opposite insult country communities. Make no mistake, they can rationalise it anyway they want. They can try to dress it up any way they want. But, at the end of the day, they are opposing drought support for drought-stricken farmers and drought-stricken country communities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a huge number of good things happening in country Australia, even though these are very difficult times. There are community groups pulling together. There are people passing the hat around. Just one example is the Rotary Club of Rylstone-Kandos. That club has been taking donations from Rotary Clubs from all over New South Wales. For example, they've taken thousands of dollars from the Rotary Club of Newcastle Enterprise, the club from Walacia-Mulgoa Valley and the Rotary Club of Ku-ring-gai. They've taken community donations. They've raised $12,000 themselves. The Rotary Club of Rylstone-Kandos have worked with the Rotary Club of Mudgee to distribute this aid right across drought-stricken communities in their area. They've helped purchase household items and water deliveries. They've given vouchers to families through the local schools, for groceries and fuel. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to acknowledge the Rotary Club of Rylstone-Kandos and community groups all over Australia who are pulling together in a show of community unity. I want to quickly mention the president, Klaus Keck; the vice president, David Fuller; Amanda Roach; Graham Jose; the Treasurer, Gary Oakes; the district governor, David Roach; Greg Bennett; and Wendy Williams. This is not unique. This is what's happening all over country Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> I am glad that episode is being broadcast to the people of Australia, because I want them to know and hear and see the petty politics which is being played with this most vital of national issues. Country Australia is watching. Country Australia is listening. And they've had a gutful of it. This is a time when the nation should be uniting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking about the resilience of our country communities and how they're coming together. I draw the House's attention to the Lions Clubs of our district in Australia. There is Lions Club district 201N4 and their drought appeal. Anne Jones, the disaster alert chair, has been instrumental in raising money from all over Australia and the world. As of 30 June this year $1.3 million has been raised—they live just outside of Wellington—along with $700,000 worth of household items distributed through the local Lions Clubs. Her husband, Peter Perry, works with her and helps. They've had great support from the Wellington and Geurie Lions Club, including Christine Hardy and Karen McHale. Well done to all Lions involved. It's a great example of our communities pulling together. Compare such great community support—overwhelming community support and a desire to get our country communities through this drought—with the petty party politics which we've seen displayed on this bill in this House tonight. It's appalling. The national drought relief effort stands at over $7 billion. It is the largest drought relief effort in Australia's history. My fear is that this drought is going to continue for some years yet, so we need to prepare ourselves for that possibility and the possibility that the worst is yet to come. The Future Drought Fund is important because it helps prepare for the continuing effects of this drought and also future droughts. Drought support will need to be ramped up as conditions continue to deteriorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I call on the opposition to put aside the petty, partisan politics and start backing our farmers and backing the bush. Stop playing the petty procedural games that have dogged this debate all afternoon and into the night. Our country communities want this bill passed. We need relief for farmers. The farmers are saying so and our farmers organisations are saying so, yet those opposite continue to try to block it with this petty, partisan political game playing. They should be better than that. This is a moment when our parliament should be better than that, but they are not rising to the occasion. Instead, we get these nonsensical and juvenile amendments put forward by the member for Hunter after he received a massive slap in the face from his own electorate. We've seen a very clear message sent from country communities and communities all over Australia—city and country—that those policies have been rejected. There is a mandate for this legislation and this fund. I commend it to the House, and I urge all members to get behind it and start supporting country Australia and farmers all over our great nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the Future Drought Fund Bill. This bill broadly mirrors the bill which passed the House earlier this year. I supported the bill then and I intend to support the bill again today. However, Centre Alliance has some concerns around the measures contained in this bill and we will reserve our position in the Senate, although I am pleased to continue talks with the minister in good faith while the bill has passage through this House and into the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Low rainfall and rising temperatures have already crept into my electorate, with dairy farmers struggling to meet the rising cost of water, yet at the same time apple growers in other parts of my electorate are being bombarded with fierce storms and face the prospect of another year, potentially, of damage from those storms. I fear that the drought, the unpredictable storms and the weather that we cannot predict will become the new normal as we march towards a future where climate is changing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a nationally consistent approach to ensure that all primary producers are equipped to deal with the consequences of a changing climate. The government says that this Future Drought Fund is to be a long-term investment intended to build resilience, including preparedness and recovery, in drought-affected communities. It aims to provide support to research, development and innovation projects but will also deliver infrastructure projects and support to improve environmental and natural resource management, and I commend those aims. But to meet these aims, the bill will facilitate the transfer of $3.9 billion from the Building Australia Fund to the proposed Future Drought Fund. The Building Australia Fund provided the government with the opportunity to invest in critical infrastructure across the nation, including sustainable water infrastructure programs to encourage drought-resilient communities across Australia. My concern is that, while well-intentioned, the focus of the Future Drought Fund could perhaps be decidedly narrower, with a disproportionate focus on particular locations or electorates, and I don't think we want to see that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is expected that the Future Drought Fund will, under the guidance of the Future Fund Board of Guardians, grow to $5 billion over the next decade while at the same time making annual disbursements of around $100 million, with the first proposed to occur on 1 July 2020. While I commend the qualifications and experience required for the people who will be the part-time members of the Future Fund board, I also think it's really important that the members are geographically diverse across Australia. I do not want to see that board become a board of east coast members. It's important to remember that all parts of Australia experience drought, and all parts of Australia have agriculture as a significant part of their reason for being a state, essentially, including my electorate. I often hear in this place that people feel that New South Wales is the food bowl. Well, can I just say that my electorate of Mayo also considers itself to be a food bowl. We grow a variety of products, a variety of horticulture—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disbursements will be made in accordance with yet to be published grant guidelines and consistent with amendments moved by the former member for Indi in the last parliament. Detailed information around the recipients and the projects will be published on the department's website. The projects must be consistent with the Drought Resilience Funding Plan. The plan is a high-level framework designed to guide the Future Drought Fund programs, and each plan will be in place for a period of four years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome this longer-term approach to drought and emergency management. For too long environmental management has been a litany of ad hoc policy decisions, which have served only to compound the challenges facing our farmers. What we need now more than ever is a long-term vision for drought resilience, prudent environmental management and for this government to show leadership and an attempt to tackle the root causes of climate change—something on which we don't yet have consensus across this parliament, which really is quite flabbergasting. Proper, sustained and recurrent funding for community environment groups would be a good start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that the development of drought resilience funding plans may be a step in the right direction, and I take some comfort from the fact that each Drought Resilience Funding Plan will be subject to an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to determine the effectiveness of each plan. I believe that this review is important. In circumstances where the government has foreshadowed its intention to disburse $100 million in drought projects each financial year, this is a fundamental requirement of good governance. We must ensure that the funds are going to the right people operating the right programs in the right areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank the former member for Indi, Ms Cathy McGowan, for her amendments in the last bill, which then became part of the body of this bill. I'd also like to acknowledge the goodwill of government for including the amendments of the former member for Indi into this bill. I must say, when I reflect on her time in this place, she viewed every decision in this place through a regional lens of good governance and transparency in the parliament. The amendments being incorporated into this bill certainly go to the heart of accountable and transparent government and are reflective of the former member's sustained efforts to advance the interests of regional and rural communities across Australia. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:29</span>):  Before I get onto my substantive contribution to the debate, I'd just like to raise two matters. The first point is that I'll be moving a second reading amendment to add some words to the amendment moved by the member for Hunter. I raise that at the start because I understand that things are moving very quickly here, and I'm not sure whether copies have been made available yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make before I get onto the substance of my contribution is about the process tonight. I would have liked a chance to read this Future Drought Fund Bill before being asked to debate it and, potentially, vote on it. This is a bill talking about spending billions of dollars. For people talking about transparency to require us to now debate it and, potentially, vote on it tonight is appalling. And this bill was introduced into this House incorporating, we're told, some very important amendments. Those amendments, as the member for Mayo has set out, were negotiated by the former member for Indi, and, in general, we think those amendments are pretty good. We want the chance to work out whether or not those amendments are faithfully incorporated in this bill. I want the chance, as a member of parliament who is being asked to authorise the spending of several billion dollars, to go and test this bill—get people to have a look at it, get some input on it and then decide what my contribution is going to be. In that context, even as little as 24 hours would have been helpful. We could have done what usually is done, which is introduce a bill, give people 24 hours to reflect on it and then come back and vote on it if it is that urgent. But we don't have that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and—I must say, with a heavy heart—some members of the crossbench have denied me and other members of the parliament the chance to fully read this bill and understand it. Instead, we're being forced to state a position on spending several billion dollars right here, right now, and that is not the way this place should be run. People who have waved the banner for transparency need to remember what has happened tonight and need to remember the process that has led us here, because now people who I didn't think would force me to have to vote on $5 billion have just joined with the government to force me to do that. I say that with a heavy heart because we should not be here in this situation. The government should not be doing that, and they're the ones who bear the main responsibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way this place works is that conversations take place between people, including on the floor of parliament. Sometimes those conversations are free and frank, and it's good that they take place in a way that allows things to progress, because otherwise this place could get ground down. I haven't betrayed any confidences in my time here and I am not going to start now. But I do think it is important that this place knows that we on the crossbench were all told that this debate was going to finish at 7.30 pm. We were told that we would pull up stumps at 7.30 pm so that everyone could go through the usual processes and have a chance to consider their position on it so that we could come back tomorrow. No sooner were we told that by a very senior member of the government than the opposite happened, and that person knows who they are. That person knows who they are and that they came and told us we were going to pull up stumps at 7.30 pm, at the usual time, with the adjournment, and that's not what's happening.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lesson in that for everyone here. There's a lesson in that for the crossbench. There's a lesson in that for the opposition. And that is that, when the government tell you that they're going to be fair on process, don't believe them for a second. The government had the opportunity to do that and they blew it. You might think, 'Oh, it doesn't matter; it's just the Greens.' Well, there's another place, called the Senate. Usually in this place, we can have discussions across the aisle, amongst each other, and agree to disagree. When someone tells you a process is going to happen and you're going to get the chance to consider a bill, you can usually take people at their word. Well, in week 2 of this parliament, I have learnt something very, very quickly. Don't take this government at their word when they tell you they are going to give you a chance to look at bills—because this is forcing the parliament to vote on spending $5 billion without the chance for any proper scrutiny at all. That in and of itself is reason for us all to be very, very concerned about what the next three years are going to look like. We should all be very concerned, after this afternoon, about the next three years, because what we have learned is that the government will say and do anything to win support for a particular vote and then renege on it within an hour—renege on it within an hour—to suit their purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Okay, you've won your vote. We're having the debate tonight. But we've learnt the lesson; we've learnt how you're going to operate. And in all the time that I've been here, even under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, I've not seen practice this sharp. This is the sharpest practice I have seen from a government. It is disappointing that others have got caught up in the wake, but they probably had the right to take the government at its word as well. And I think everyone here has learnt a lesson tonight: that you do not take this government and its senior people at their word when they tell you how things are going to run. This is the sharpest practice I have seen in all my time in this place, and on a bill that is so significant, when you're introducing amendments. This isn't the same bill that we saw before. When you're bringing up an amendment bill, give us the chance to look at it. Give us 24 hours. Give people the chance to go and look at it and work out whether it does what you say it does. Who knows—people might want to vote in favour of it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the sake of buying yourself a couple of hours, when we could have had this debate and the vote tomorrow, you have just trashed any goodwill or any standing you had on how this place is going to run. You might have got your little victory tonight, but what you've done is send a very clear message to me, to my party and to everyone who sits on the cross bench that you'll come here and say one thing and then something else will happen an hour later. Noted. I'm not going to say who it was who said that, but they know who they are. Noted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Onto the substance of the bill and the amendment that I will move—if the government were serious about tackling drought, you would imagine that they would be saying the words 'climate change' over and over again. If this government were serious about making sure, as the member from Mayo said, that what we're seeing now doesn't become the new normal, or even the new baseline good, they would be falling over themselves to stop global warming. We were told very, very clearly at the end of last year that, unless we want to set ourselves on a path where we're going to see a 92 per cent decline in agricultural productivity in the Murray-Darling Basin, we are going to have to get the world two-thirds out of coal-fired power within the next 10 years. The best gift that could be given to farmers is to tackle global warming so that the droughts we're seeing now don't become a regular way of life, all the time—not just things that happen every now and then, as nature changes, but a regular way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bureau of Meteorology has said that the drought in the Murray-Darling Basin is now the most severe in 120 years of records. Last week the climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, Dr David Jones, said that, while the Federation drought and the World War II drought were similar to this one, this is worse. While the north of the basin is doing it harder than the south, he said: from the general picture across the Murray-Darling Basin for droughts lasting two to three years, this is the most severe we've seen in terms of the rainfall totals and probably also in terms of the general run-off into dams. And this drought is hotter, with temperatures across the Murray-Darling about one degree hotter than during the Federation drought. Australia has warmed by about a degree. The world has warmed by about a degree as a result of global warming. This is what global warming looks like! And that's going to mean more evaporation and more transpiration when it rains, and it's going to mean that plants and animals are going to require more water when it comes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bureau and others have identified three key drivers of the severity of the drought, two of which are directly related to climate change: underlying reduction in southern wet season rainfall driven by climate change; underlying temperature increases driven by climate change; and the warm conditions in the far Indian and Pacific oceans resulting in reduced rainfall—the so-called Indian Ocean Dipole and El-Nino-like conditions in the Pacific. But it's also worth noting that, on that third factor, there are predictions from some scientists that El Ninos could become more frequent in a warming world. The picture of the millions of fish killed in the Menindee Lakes is the most graphic example of a complete crisis across the rivers and wetlands and agricultural communities of the Murray-Darling Basin—a crisis that was predictable a decade ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I flagged at the start, Professor Ross Garnaut's climate review warned of the collapse of agriculture in the Murray-Darling because of global warming. It seems we are now well into the beginning of that collapse. Without emergency action to limit global warming, Professor Garnaut's prediction of a 92 per cent loss in irrigated agricultural production by the end of the century will come to pass because there will be an ecological collapse, as predicted. It is happening as they told us it would happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you do? You come in here and pretend that it doesn't exist. Members from the back bench give their climate-denying speeches. Then you try to take public money away from schools and hospitals to keep open coal-fired power stations. You are not serious about protecting farmers from the drought. You're not serious about looking after regions that are undergoing drought, because if you were you would not wish more droughts on them. But that's what you're doing. As pollution goes up and up, as you pretend that climate change doesn't exist and as you chuck around lumps of coal in parliament, you are wishing more droughts on Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The digging, exporting and burning of coal, oil and gas are the major causes of climate change and, therefore, key drivers of the drought we are experiencing and the worsening droughts that we will face in the future. Every tonne of coal that this government allows to be exported is another farm facing extinction. Whilst the funds in these bills may ameliorate in some way the impacts on farmers for a short amount of time, the reality is that this government is doing much more to cause this crisis than this fund will ever cancel out. You have been put on notice. What it means for farmers and regions if we do not get global warming under control has been put on notice. And what do you do? You come in here and propose to make it worse. </span>

If you can move a motion that can tell us, basically a year out, what's going to happen to the weather, move that motion. We'll all vote for that. But you have come in here to do what you always do. You come in here with a mechanism and you afflict on people in rural areas the idea that you will deliver them a climate change policy. Well, a climate change policy does not put food on the table. It does not put food on the table now; it does not look after people now. You would go to my electorate, which is probably the epicentre of the drought, to areas such as Bundarra and Manilla, and you would see people almost living in poverty—there is nothing there—and you would say to them, 'My alternative for you, what the Greens are going to offer you, is the capacity to move a motion to make power dearer.' Basically, that's it: they're going to make power dearer.

We have had it in regional areas. We do not have the capacity to take people to a form of dignity that they deserve in their life. The member has offered nothing but a mechanism to garner votes in his inner suburban seat, where they are a thousand miles from the problems that we have been dealing with. We are trying to help people out. We are trying to make sure we give them some form of mitigant, not to the weather but to the poverty and to the pain that they are currently suffering. We are going to make sure, by moving this bill, that we can at least offer them some hope, some prospect, into the long future. We have the capacity to put $100 million on the table, and they can plan. I'll tell you how they can plan. They can plan by building dams and creating water infrastructure, because water infrastructure is the mitigant. Obviously a drought is a time without water, and water gives us the capacity to provide some hope of irrigation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, the Greens Party don't believe in the live cattle industry, don't believe in the live sheep industry, don't believe in the construction of dams and don't believe in a cheap out. What they believe in is affluence. They have the richest constituency in Australia—the affluent and their views—and that is being prescribed for people who are basically trying to make their way through the times. It's not only people on farms but people in towns who just can't afford for this parliament, in this period of time, to not offer them some prospect of hope and some sort of financial life raft to deal with the issues that are before them. We need this to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party said at Dubbo that they would not vote against anything that helped in the drought. Then, basically in the next sentence, they put a caveat on that. They put a caveat on the principle. They were going to come back here immediately after the drought summit in Dubbo and play politics. That's what all of this was about. Not once did we hear in question time prior to the election any prospect of them having a drought policy—not once. Not once did they come to the dispatch box. Not once did they go to Sky, the ABC or any media outlet and say, 'This is our drought policy.' Their beliefs are completely disingenuous about looking after regional Australia. They were dealt a savage blow at the last election because they have no view for regional Australia. They were smashed at the last election, especially in Queensland, because they have no view for regional Australia. Now we are seeing that the Labor Party are basically once more back to their old tricks. They're back to their old tricks of disregarding regional Australia and not having any authenticity to drive forward an agenda for regional Australia. They have no views for regional Australia. They're back in the inner suburbs, and the Greens are right there with them. They're their people. St Kilda are their people. That's who they're going to be looking after. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we are going to make sure, and the National Party is absolutely proud of the fact, that we drive forward with a tangible outcome that brings real financial benefit—financial benefit by reason of farmhouse allowance, by reason of concessional loans, by reason of the subsidisation of on-farm water infrastructure. These are the things that $100 million a year has been put as a forward proposition, which the Labor Party in the future, if they ever get back into power, if they want to remove it—and I suggest they probably will—will have to legislate to get rid of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we will stand against the Greens. We want to thank Bob Brown. We want to thank him from the depths of our hearts for helping us to win the election. Bob Brown did a great service to our nation. When he decided to go to Central Queensland, he helped the coalition stay in government. He helped remove any prospect of the Labor Party winning the election, so the Greens should be thankful for the work that they've done on behalf of our nation in delivering yet another coalition government to our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to thank the left wing of the Labor Party for their tirade against coal because their tirade against coal helped the coalition win the election. We want to thank them for that. And we want to thank GetUp! for concentrating so much on the seat of Warringah. We want to thank them for that because they won Warringah and lost the election. We want to thank them for that. We want to thank this coalition of GetUp!, the Labor Party and the Greens for making sure that we're here for another three years. We want to thank you and, once more, you watch, this bill's going to go through. We want to thank the parliament, and we want to thank the Australian people for making you once again totally and utterly irrelevant.</span>

                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  Last Thursday in Dubbo, I was there with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. They had a whole gaggle of ministers there from the federal government. I stood up. There were hundreds of people there. Declared, I offered Labor's support for this drought fund. I offered it. Five hundred people were there, and I said: 'We support it. We'll, support it not just for $100 million; we'll support it at any level you're prepared to put forward. We can bring it forward to the current financial year, not 12 months time. It could be more than $100 million, and we'd vote for it.' That's what I declared in front of 500 people on live national TV, and ever since last Thursday this mob over here have been campaigning for us to reverse that position and vote against the drought fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that they are determined to play politics because they do not have an agenda for the future. They're scared of the present but terrified of the future—terrified of acting in the national interest. I mentioned something when I spoke to that drought summit and I used two words that the Prime Minister didn't use. Guess what they were? Climate change. Because you can't talk about drought in this country without also addressing the long-term impact of climate change. The need for mitigation. The need to make sure that we build resilience in our farms. That we are as strong in this chamber as farmers are on their land. That is what we need in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, what we had from those opposite was a Prime Minister who went along to a drought summit and offered—let's be very clear here; forget about $5 billion. There is nothing in this financial year in this legislation. There is $100 million to be drawn down the following year and $100 million the year after that. So the total funding for drought relief to assist farmers to build resilience, to build infrastructure, over this term of the 46th Parliament is $200 million. This mob give that to mates over a cup of tea when they're getting out their various pork funds that they've established. This mob waste more than that before breakfast. $200 million—that's all they offered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what I said: 'Don't play politics with this. It is too important. Just stop it. Provide funding with appropriations, as you should, and we'll back it—any level you want, done.' That's what I said—without being given any notice or the courtesy of a discussion with the Prime Minister, who stood up before that meeting and made this grand announcement. Sorry, he did make another one as well: we're going to have a parliamentary committee. But he didn't have anything to say about significant infrastructure funding. He had nothing to say about climate change. He had nothing to say about real assistance with regard to the people who are really doing it tough when it comes to farmers. And then he has the hide and the arrogance that he'll play wedge politics with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has he said this debate is about? Has he said it's about the need of the rural communities? Has he said it's about farmers? No. He has said it's about Labor. That is what he has said and what he has said about every bill he's introducing and debating before the parliament this week—that it is about Labor. Well, I've got news for the Prime Minister. He won the election. He should start acting like the government, instead of like an opposition in exile, scared of governing. That's the way he's behaving at the moment, the immaturity of the way this debate has been conducted. In the 23 years that I have represented Grayndler in this parliament—I've been leader of the House and I've been Manager of Opposition business; I've dealt with the former member for Warringah and others, who like to think of themselves as hard nuts—I've never seen anything like this, whereby they couldn't get their act together to get the legislation through that was announced in October. They couldn't get it through the 45th Parliament—couldn't be bothered even putting it to the Senate. They couldn't be bothered having it amongst the 26 pieces of legislation that we introduced in the last sitting week. But they come in here and say, 'We've got a plan: we'll stop the Labor caucus getting a say in what happens.' Well, congratulations. You've achieved that, because there'll be a vote tonight, even though a minister went up there and said to me and the crossbenchers that the parliament would adjourn at 7.30 so as to allow proper processes. And then they say it's urgent. Not a cent flows before July 2020. I've never seen anything less urgent. What is urgent is the needs of farmers. What isn't urgent is your response to that need. You have failed, and you underline that failure with your arrogance and your contempt for the proper processes of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have respect for this parliament. I have never, ever ratted on a deal that's been done across the chamber. If I give my word, that is it—crossbenchers, the other side, the relationship I had with the former member for Sturt. Some might criticise that, but at the end of the day, if you behave like this it catches up with you. It is the arrogance writ large of a government in search of an agenda, of a Prime Minister who thinks the Australian people all think that everything he says is okay, that it's a free for all. I say to the crossbenchers: think again next time they give you a commitment, next time they tell you that during a debate. This wasn't a commitment a few hours ago. They couldn't last half an hour from when they said it would happen. That's why the position of the government is, quite frankly, untenable. And what's the objective here? We said we'd support the drought fund, and we will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are disappointed with the effort to which the government's gone to abolish the Building Australia Fund. The Building Australia Fund assists people in regional Australia to get goods to market. They make our roads safer. The Pacific Highway will have fewer deaths as a result of the Building Australia Fund. The fact is that they don't like transparency. They just want the National Party ministers to decide what happens with money. They don't want Infrastructure Australia. When you set up Infrastructure Australia, you have to have a fund to fund projects that have been assessed by it, including water infrastructure projects. But, as a result of this, they'll get rid of the Building Australia Fund. They also want to get rid of the Education Investment Fund. They hate transparency and they hate accountability, and that's really what this is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fourth time they've linked the abolition of the BAF to legislation. The worst time, perhaps, was linking it to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. One of the ministers spoke about going low in this debate. That's going low: if you support the Building Australia Fund, you don't support people with disabilities. How low is that! If you support the Building Australia Fund or you support drought funding—how pathetic. Here's some maths for the National Party. Even Barnaby should be able to work this out. There's $200 million you're going to get this term for drought funding, but you're removing $3.9 billion from the Building Australia Fund. You don't even have to count all the zeros to know that $3.9 billion out and $200 million in is a pretty bad deal. Even the member for New England should be able to understand that. As a result of this, as I declared last Thursday in front of 500 people, as a Labor Party we won't oppose this legislation because we support the drought fund. That is what we will do.</span>

                    </a>  You've got to worry when you can't make the National Party front bench. In terms of the parliament, we will not be opposing the drought fund. We will be in government once again committed to restructuring Infrastructure Australia and making it a strong body once again by having a genuinely independent board of experts, making sure that it can do its job in driving microeconomic reform and having proper cost-benefit analysis and rigour in terms of infrastructure. We will establish in the future a fund like the Building Australia Fund because we think it is essential that there be a funding component.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, those opposite show once again that they're the wreckers. When they talk about genuine economic reform, they are in their third term and they are struggling with the question: what are the big reforms that they have made? Yes, they got rid of a climate change policy that we had, but they haven't got one for themselves. On economic policy, yes, some tax cuts have got through, but there's no tax reform. Tax reform is what the Hawke and Keating government did. John Howard's government, to be fair, brought about some tax reform. What they've done is some tax cuts, which is very different from economic reform. On the skills agenda, what have they done? Nothing whatsoever. We've seen a decline in Australia's position. In terms of our engagement with the world, where are we? We're an embarrassment on so many indicators. When it comes to action on drought and water policy, of course we have in this country an absolute crisis going on in the Murray-Darling Basin, and this government thinks that a bill with $100 million 12 months from now is all that they need to do. When it comes to the forward-looking agenda, they simply don't have one. They have arrogance. They have hubris. They don't have an agenda. That is why they try to define everything as being about us. When we raised today, in the first question of parliament, the Prime Minister's comments about the fact that we've supported the unanimous recommendations of the joint committee that looks at national security issues, the Prime Minister dismissed that again. It's all politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australians have is conflict fatigue. They are looking for solutions, not arguments. This is a government that is obsessed by arguments. It is obsessed by arguments with itself. That is why they are unable to actually move forward with a forward-looking agenda. We, on this side, will continue to hold the government to account, but we will also be developing a forward-looking agenda to meet the challenges that are there, going forward as a nation. One of those challenges is drought. You can't deal with that without dealing with climate change. You can't deal with that without having a sound environmental policy. You can't deal with that without having rigour and transparency around funding mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been improved from the original bill because of the amendments that were moved by the former member for Indi. That's why you have proper parliamentary procedure. It's so you actually have analysis and you improve legislation. That's why this government's position, in ramming this through tonight without proper scrutiny and debate, is such an outrage. I say to the government: its performance on the procedures tonight has brought no credit to it and no credit to this parliament. The government really needs to consider the consequences of the way that it has behaved before this parliament. That is particularly given the context whereby I declared, as Leader of the Labor Party both publicly and in discussions with the government, that we were supportive of the drought fund. Under those circumstances, the government's behaviour is nothing less than bizarre.</span>

There it is just a typo change to the amendment that has been circulated. Where it says 'that all of the words after "very same"', that should read as 'that all words after "rural and regional"'. Very briefly, the effect of that is that the proposed amendment that I have moved would add all words after the amendment moved by the member for Hunter. It wouldn't alter the substance of the member for Hunter's amendment. That was the intention of it; it was just a short drafting change. I understand that, with the leave of the House, that change is acceptable to the remainder of the House.</span>

                    </a>  I refer the Leader of the House, and you, Deputy Speaker Vasta, to the ruling that was made in that chair at 7.30 tonight. In that chair at 7.30 tonight, the chair had the choice to say this suspension that had been carried by the House meant that only ministers could move motions, or it was, in the words of the Leader of the House himself, 'permissive' as a resolution—that it then simply said the bill is allowed to go through all its different stages, but motions are allowed to be moved. If that were not the case, we wouldn't have been able to negate the adjournment, because the adjournment was put to us without being moved by a minister. Keep up, son! Keep up!</span>

                    </a>  On the point of order: the motion to which he's referring, the suspension motion, had a clause (a) and a clause (b). The Leader of the House is right when he says this suspension is not asking for what happens in clause (a), because it's specifically asking the minister to take advantage of clause (b), which was in the motion that he should know. It was moved by the government, and he's meant to be the Leader of the House. With that, I submit it for your ruling, Mr Speaker.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Helpful as always! I did listen to the motion moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, obviously, when I was in my office, and the reason I'm here is I don't believe it's in order, and I've been—just rest your legs for a sec, Manager of Opposition Business! I don't believe it's in order, and obviously I've been following the debate pretty intently. I saw the substance of the point of order from the Leader of the House. The point I would make is that the earlier motion makes the point, I think, very aptly, that any variation needs to be made by a minister. I do take the point from the Manager of Opposition Business—when he moved an earlier motion, I know he made certain statements then that he thought flowed from that, which I utterly disagree with. So that's where we are. That's why I'm sitting here, telling him rather directly: I don't believe that the motion's in order.</span>

                    </a>  On a point of order: if I could refer to standing order 47, which deals with motions for the suspension of standing orders, the normal occurrence that we're used to in the House is where suspensions basically only occur between items, because most suspensions are irrelevant to the debate that's in front of us. The suspension that I have moved is different from that and is covered by standing order 47 because it is entirely about the debate that is in front of us. It in no ways varies from the clauses in what was carried by the House. In fact, it specifically asks a minister to act in the precise terms in which that resolution was carried.</span>

The motion the Manager of Opposition Business moved seeks to do something other than what has already been passed by the House, by the minister. Notwithstanding the fact that the motion he moved seeks to do something other than what is already passed by the House by the minister, I don't really see the point, because any such motion is only really seeking some variation. That is what it's seeking, and the motion's already been moved and passed by the House, and any such variation can only be moved by a minister.</span>

                    </a>  One issue: I'm trying to get a copy of the earlier resolution which I've now got in front of me. Both clauses (a) and (b) are governed by what comes at the start, which is that so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent. And so what that resolution does is any standing order which gets in the way of clause (a), which gets in the way of that process being followed, is therefore suspended. But it does not prevent the House from resolving in different ways to deal with that debate, to discuss the debate, to interpret that debate and then to call on someone to use clause (b). If for example the House had resolved—</span>

I'm not trying to be difficult on this. So much of standing orders as would prevent—that includes the standing order you've already quoted, which is standing order 47. It's every single standing order that will prevent occurring what is in this motion, and to vary that would require a minister to move it. So without going through every historical occasion—and I would be happy to dig them all out—I'm happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business for another minute or two, but that really is what's going to be in my ruling unless there's something absolutely astounding that comes forward.</span>

It invites a minister to move. It's an invitation for a minister to move. Clause (a) is descriptive in my motion. Clause (b) is descriptive, and that's clearly allowed within the terms and the standing orders and doesn't get in the way of this bill being dealt with tonight. In fact, if this entire suspension is carried, the motion that I've put forward is then moved and carried by the House, the resolution that was moved earlier today still holds. This doesn't get in the way of any of that. It simply means there will have been a resolution of the House asking the minister to do something which the minister is allowed to do in the terms of what was carried.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I just say to the Manager of Opposition Business: I've heard that but I still don't believe, having heard impatiently, that gets round the fact that essentially what the motion does in a very common way is enable every standing order that might get in the way of the purpose of the motion to be suspended. That includes standing orders that could delay, obfuscate and the substance of the motion being any variation can only be made by a minister. So, I understand what the Manager of Opposition Business is seeking to do. I know he's seeking to find a way through. I don't see that way through. With respect. I really don't. So, I'm going to rule that that motion is out of order.</span>

The standing orders are very clear on that that once the House has resolved a matter—which it has already because you've already moved that the debate be adjourned and the House has resolved it—you can't in a repetitive fashion move the same motion again. I'm going to call the minister. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  They are hungry and hopefully we're going to get them home very soon. Can I thank all the members who have contributed to the debate on the Future Drought Fund Bill. These bills will secure ongoing funding for drought-resilience projects for the establishment of a Future Drought Fund. The Future Drought Fund will be managed by the Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. These bills will secure ongoing funding for drought-resilience projects with the establishment of the Future Drought Fund. The Future Drought Fund will be managed by the Future Drought Board of Guardians who currently manage six other investment funds on behalf of the Commonwealth and have a proven and strong reputation for brilliantly investing money. The government is providing a significant up-front investment of $3.9 billion, which is expected to grow to around $5 billion over the next decade, while at the same time making annual distributions of $100 million from 2020 to 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The annual $100 million disbursement from the Future Drought Fund will fund projects aimed at strengthening the resilience of Australian farmers and farming communities to the impacts of drought. Through grants or other funding arrangements, the Future Drought Fund will support a wide range of drought-resilience measurements, measures that benefit all Australians, such as supporting infrastructure, research and innovation; the adoption of new technology; improved environmental and natural resource management; and farm and community support initiatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Drought Fund demonstrates the government's long-term commitment to build drought resilience, including preparedness and recovery across Australia. Transferring the balance of the Building Australia Fund to the Future Drought Fund will have no impact on the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Thanks to the government's prudent economic and fiscal management, we have fully funded the National Disability Insurance Scheme without utilising the uncommitted funds currently in the Building Australia Fund. We have also committed more than $100 billion over the next 10 years to new and upgraded transport infrastructure projects across Australia, $47 billion of which is planned to be invested over the forward estimates. This means that uncommitted funds in the Building Australia Fund will now be used to enhance future drought resilience preparedness and response across Australia. I once again thank all members for their contribution and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I thank the minister. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The honourable member for Melbourne has now moved as an amendment to that amendment that all words after 'rural and regional' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question now before the House is that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter be agreed to. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  On Thursday, 11 July, I attended, as I do each year, the memorial service organised by the Bosnian Herzegovina Muslim Society of South Australia, commemorating the Srebrenica genocide of 11 July 1995, where 8,372 people, including elderly people, women and children, were brutally and mercilessly massacred. A $5.8 million memorial centre and cemetery for those who died was established in Potocari, a village near to Srebrenica, and opened in 2003 by former US President Bill Clinton. I will quote part of Bill Clinton's speech at the opening of the memorial centre:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">We remember this terrible crime because we dare not forget because we must pay tribute to the innocent lives, many of them children, who were snuffed out in what must be called genocidal madness.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope the very mention of the name "Srebrenica" will remind every child in the world that pride in our own religious and ethnic heritage does not require or permit us to dehumanize or kill those who are different. I hope and pray that Srebrenica will be for all the world a sober reminder of our common humanity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 8 to 11 July, thousands of people participated in a three-day, 100-kilometre peace march from Nezuk to Potocari in memory of those massacred. The remains of a further 33 people were also identified and buried in the memorial centre cemetery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 24 years, members of Adelaide's Bosnia and Herzegovina community, most of whom migrated to Australia in the aftermath of the conflict in their home country, still understandably grieve family members and friends who were killed or who perished. For them, the haunting memories and anguish will never subside. Yet they look to the future with hope, as expressed in these words written on a banner prominently on display at the Adelaide service:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We pray to Almighty God, may grief become hope, may revenge become justice, may mothers' tears become prayers that Srebrenica never happens again, to no-one and nowhere.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined with the Bosnian people in remembering the victims of the Srebrenica massacre and in the hope that the families of those lost will find some comfort in the support of those of us who stand with them in their sorrows, and that those who were responsible for the atrocities will one day all be held to account.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge the achievements of Mr John Croll, AM. Mr Croll has had great success in the field of business as the former CEO of leading media intelligence company Isentia. He is successful not only as a businessman but also as chairman of Disability Sports Australia since 2017, a highly valued organisation. Disability Sports Australia strives to be the peak national body for state and other sports and recreation organisations representing people with a physical disability. Prior to this position at Disability Sports Australia, Mr Croll was the vice-president of the Australian Paralympic Committee and, as such, has held vital roles in representing athletes with a physical disability. I thank him for his years of service to the disabled community and for the work he has done for athletes with a physical disability, and I look forward to his future success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another local constituent I would like to acknowledge the achievements of is Professor Constance Katelaris, who earnt her name on the Queen's Birthday honours list for her significant service to medicine in the field of immunology and allergy. An Epping local, Professor Katelaris has excelled in her field of immunology and allergy. She is currently the professor of immunology and allergy at Western Sydney University and the head of unit and senior staff specialist at Campbelltown Hospital. In addition to this, she has also authored and co-authored numerous publications on immunology and allergy topics and has held executive positions within the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. I wish her all the best for her future endeavours and I'm confident she will continue to do great things for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to recognise the success and impact within our community of environment expert Ivan Kennedy. Mr Kennedy has been acknowledged in the Queen's Birthday honours list for his five decades of service to higher education and agricultural research. Over the course of his career, Mr Kennedy has published, edited and co-authored several articles and research papers in this area of agriculture, educating us about different areas of environmental science and agriculture. He has also held different positions at the University of Sydney, where he has taught and lectured numerous students of environmental science and agriculture. I thank Mr Kennedy for his years of service to science, agriculture and industry, and I look forward to reading about his future success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I recently joined members of the Cockburn Community Wildlife Corridor crew to look at the work they've been doing to regenerate banksia woodland in the Beeliar wetlands. As part of that effort, I want to acknowledge the hundreds of people who turned out the weekend before last to undertake replanting in the bush corridor that was knocked over by the Barnett government in its dying days. That clearing, quite frankly, was scandalous. One hundred hectares of bush was smashed over for no reason and $20 million of taxpayers' money was wasted—against the clear advice of Main Roads Western Australia. It was bloody-minded vandalism on a grand scale, egged on by this federal Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, much worse harm to the environment, to the WA budget and to our transport system was prevented by the campaign fought by thousands of Western Australians in the summer of 2016-17. Now the area is being rehabilitated and the federal funds have been redirected into five major transport projects that will address congestion, reduce truck freight and create local construction jobs in the next few years. After a decade of inaction from state and federal Liberal governments, it's fantastic that the south metro area will soon benefit from the widening of the freeway northbound from Russell Road, the new North Lake Road bridge and duplication of Armadale Road, the comprehensive upgrade of the High Street and Stirling Highway intersection, the Metronet link from Cockburn to Thornlie, and a new Fremantle traffic and rail bridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is five major transport projects covering road, rail and public transport. It is more than a billion dollars worth of well-designed local transport projects being delivered in the Fremantle electorate by the McGowan Labor government. That means a further reduction in the number of trucks on local roads, including Leach Highway. It means less congestion, improved safety and more public transport options. It also means keeping an important local ecosystem in good health, and that's critical to the survival of rare and endangered native species, including migratory birds. Anyone who thinks that inflicting damage on a remnant wetland like Beeliar is a trivial matter needs to have their head checked.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australian biodiversity is under threat. We know that Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, and the government should explain why there are no current recovery plans in place for five out of the nine critically endangered Australian mammals. It should explain why, in the absence of clear reporting, it is estimated there are no recovery plans for 40 per cent of all threatened species. We know habitat loss represents the biggest driver of population decline for native species. We've already knocked over something like 40 per cent of the Australian forests that existed at settlement. We need to do better or we'll continue to see plants, birds, reptiles, fish and mammals—our biodiversity—disappear. People in my electorate are getting directly involved in habitat protection and they want to see their government step up to the task.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I have the privilege of representing one of the most diverse and harmonious electorates in Australia. More than one-third of my constituents were born overseas. More than one-third speak a language other than English at home. If you want a national comparison, over half of my constituents had both of their parents born overseas, compared to the national average of just over one-third. This is a very ethnically diverse electorate, and I'm proud to say I believe it's probably the most harmonious, or one of the most harmonious, places in the whole nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was, therefore, an honour to be able to announce in April, along with the then Minister for Families and Social Services, the Hon. Paul Fletcher, a special $50,000 grant to continue a multicultural festival in Menzies. Multicultural festivals have been conducted for a number of years, probably going back over a decade now, in the municipality, and were funded in the past by the City of Manningham. For a variety of reasons, that funding source came to a halt, and there was a great desire on the part of my various ethnic and interfaith groups to continue to conduct a multicultural interfaith festival. Therefore, as I said, it was a great privilege to be able to announce, along with the minister, a grant to enable this to continue into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The grant goes to the Manningham Interfaith Network, a body which was established in 2003 to bring together people of the various faiths that live in Menzies—not only people of Christian faith but people of the Muslim faith and Baha'i. We also have Jewish synagogue, a mosque and various other groups representing different great faiths from around the world who all have their home in Menzies. This grant will go towards conducting a festival or possibly even a number of small festivals to bring all of these groups together and to continue that harmonious environment in which they live. It's great to be able to see groups such as the Italian, Greek, Macedonian and Chinese senior citizens clubs; the House of Persia; the Baha'i community; the Coptic Church; St Haralambos Orthodox Greek Parish; the North-Eastern Synagogue; the Malaysian-Singaporean Association; the Hong Kong Club; the Veneto Club; the Indian Association; the Chinmaya Mission; and the United Muslim Migrants Association being amongst those groups which are backing this interfaith and multicultural festival. I wish them all the best in the future and, in particular, with this festival.</span>

Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes we forget to focus on what kind of country we want to be. We get caught up in division. We get caught up in blame. Last week I had the privilege of meeting with our local not-for-profits and community organisations centred on housing and homelessness. These people work day in, day out, to make a difference, to be compassionate, to be caring, to aspire to be a better country and a better community. Shadow minister Jason Clare joined me to meet with a group we call the H3—Health, Housing &amp; Homelessness. This is a group that has been working tirelessly. They come together readily and actively advocate in this space. It was an absolute pleasure to meet with them once again, introduce them to our new shadow minister and be in the room for an incredibly important conversation. These people are an example of what we should all be doing—reaching for our humanity, seeking to support rather than blame, to help rather than hinder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing crisis in the west of Melbourne and in the outer west is at extraordinary levels. We heard stories of families living in cars; of broken lives being put back together; of the people who work side by side with people who've fallen off the cliff of homelessness to build trust, to rebuild confidence and self-belief, to get stuff sorted—a roof, an address, a GP visit; the first steps to re-engaging with society, re-engaging with the system, re-engaging in order to get payments to support them. In Melbourne's west, homelessness increased 40 per cent between 2011 and 2016. When television covers homelessness, it tends to be in the CBDs of our major cities. It is rife in the outer suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the people we met with and the work that they do every day: from cohealth, from Melbourne City Mission, from Bolton Clarke, from Wyndham City Council, from Wombat Housing and Support Services, from Whitelion, from WEstjustice, from Wyndham Community &amp; Education Centre, from Uniting and from the Salvation Army. Their work is incredibly important, and they need this government to sit up and pay attention and to address the issues that are happening in our suburbs every day. When I walk the Werribee River and see people living in tents, I am horrified. I am mortified at what our country is coming to.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I rise today because I would like to raise awareness of and acknowledge a group of incredibly impressive jobseekers from the Skills for Education and Employment, or SEE, program, who I was fortunate enough to meet with last week in Launceston. Levi, Sue, Merridee, Abbey, Maddi and Terry are a group of impressive individuals who are proactively working towards obtaining gainful employment and a greater quality of life. Many are also giving back to their community outside of their work-seeking obligations, and I'd like to give a special mention to Abbey, who spends a considerable amount of time volunteering with the Salvation Army.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As their elected member, I'm passionate about doing what I can to ensure that jobseekers have access to employment opportunities, but I acknowledge that there are obstacles which can affect their chances of meeting their obligations or gaining employment. From meeting this group, I heard a variety of individual stories and circumstances. While I certainly understand that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, there are a number of areas that they raised that present some common barriers. One of these is transport affordability and accessibility, which is an issue that I would like to see improved in order to give jobseekers a real chance of obtaining employment. Additionally, both Centrelink and job network providers require jobseekers to have access to a mobile phone and to the internet in order to fulfil their obligations, but for many of these jobseekers who are already disadvantaged the cost of having a mobile phone or internet at home can be prohibitive, which in turn affects their chances of gaining employment. As somebody who spent quite a few years in casual jobs myself before securing stable employment, I certainly understand some of the challenges that many jobseekers face. I'm proud of the coalition government's continued investment in jobs and growth in my electorate of Bass, but I will continue to raise these issues with my federal and state colleagues in an effort to create some meaningful change in these areas.</span>

Thank you to Paddy and the group for helping my staff organise the booths on election day and to all the booth captains who helped set up. The scrutineers have a difficult task and, in staying behind, they miss out on the election campaign party.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  As members of parliament, we all acknowledge the importance of education. In fact, it is possibly the one thing we all agree on. Education gives children the opportunity to build their skills and create the building blocks and talents and choices in ways that will enable them to flourish and prosper. Pacific Hills Christian School in my electorate recently celebrated 40 years of outstanding work. The school was established in 1979 with eight students and one teacher, Mrs Lyn McCrindle, who served her students with the same love and passion as teachers at the school continue to do today. Today the board is led by Lyn's son Mark, and Lyn continues to serve the school as a board member. The board is filled with passionate parents and supporters of the school: Max Maddock, Nathan Parkin, Helen McDougall, Tony Morgan, Daniel Wong and Julianne Duggan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six years after the school began, Dr Ted Boyce became the school principal. Dr Boyce is an educational institution not just in my community but across the country. His leadership, his commitment to Christian values, and his pastoral approach have made him a beacon for educators nationally. Under his excellent leadership, Pacific Hills Christian School has grown to over 1, 300 students. From its earliest beginnings, the school has been grounded in a commitment to education that includes a full range of students with a wide range of abilities and challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years ago, New Hope School was started, alongside Pacific Hills Christian School, to educate and support children with intellectual disability and autism. New Hope School is an integral part of the school's mission and is a fantastic initiative. Students at both New Hope and Pacific Hills interact and learn together, but the children at New Hope are also able to get the specialist learning support that they require.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When schools educate children, they not only give them a whole range of skills: they point them in the direction of how to live a good life. Pacific Hills Christian School understands that education isn't simply about enabling people to take their place in the workforce or to compete and succeed in the marketplace. As a new parent, I often reflect on this. When we raise a child and offer them the best of what we know, we are teaching them how to wonder, how to live in a world full of beauty and mystery, how to worship and how to love. A maths lesson is not simply a way of learning how to measure and count in order to accomplish a task, but a way of encountering the incredible intricacy and wonder of creation. Education is about helping children to be well-rounded people who notice the people around them, care about the world, take leadership and have character and virtue to make the society flourish. Justice, integrity, courage, patience, compassion, commitment—those lessons are taught alongside geography, maths and history. The children are valued regardless of their abilities and encouraged to serve and excel with whatever capacity and skills they may have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend everyone at Pacific Hills Christian School on 40 fantastic years. The school has enriched our community and I am proud it is part of the Berowra electorate. I look forward to seeing what the next 40 years will bring.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  Saturday, 20 July marked the 45th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. It is now 45 years since the division of Cyprus. Its capital city, Nicosia, is the last remaining divided capital city. Commemorative events marking the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey on 20 July 1974 were held across Cyprus and across its diaspora, including in Australia. Cypriots the world over have not forgotten—and, indeed, will never forget—the still ongoing occupation and division of their homeland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note that Australia has supported at a bipartisan level the Republic of Cyprus in its 45-year struggle for a peaceful and just resolution. Australia has also sought to play a constructive role in bringing the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities together through dialogue in search of a way forward. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the Cyprus academic dialogue, an Australian initiative established under the then Rudd Labor government. Reflective of our country's bipartisanship on this issue, this dialogue continues to be supported by our government today. I've had the privilege of meeting many Cypriot politicians, academics and civil society members from both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities as they have worked their way towards peace. A lot of that contact happened during the presidential term of Dimitris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday 21 June this year, His Excellency Mr Dimitris Christofias, the former President of the Republic of Cyprus, passed away at the age of 72. President Christofias dedicated his life to pursuing justice for his beloved homeland, and fought hard during his term as president to secure its reunification. Dimitris Christofias was born in the village of Dhikomo, in the Kyrenia region, in the now occupied north of Cyprus. He was himself a refugee. He was first elected to the Cypriot parliament in May 1991. In 2001 he was elected President of the House of Representatives. He served as the sixth President of Cyprus from 2008 to 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met President Christofias on a number of occasions throughout his career both here and in Cyprus. He last visited Australia in 2011. President Christofias valued the close ties between our two countries. Australia has the second-largest Cypriot community outside of Cyprus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dimitris Christofias was a warrior for Cyprus. He supported rapprochement with his compatriots, the Turkish Cypriots. He believed that the two communities could find a way forward to resolve the issues hindering reunification. He considered his Turkish Cypriots as fellow Cypriots who, away from all the political posturing and interferences of those who work against reunification, could be persuaded to be bold. In his own words, whilst visiting Adelaide in 2011:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Turkish Cypriots are not our enemies. They are our brothers. They are Cypriots like us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a humble man who will always be remembered as a strong and astute political leader. On behalf of the Australia-Cyprus Parliamentary Friendship Group, I want to pass on sympathies to his family and to the people of Cyprus.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  The Morrison government is all about busting congestion for communities around Australia. In my electorate of Boothby we are busting congestion everywhere we can. Yet another important congestion-busting project commenced on 19 July, when the first sod was turned on the Flinders Link rail project. I was there with my state colleagues, minister for infrastructure Stephan Knoll and member for Davenport Steve Murray, along with Mark Gregory from Flinders University, to mark this important milestone. I am very proud that I was able to secure federal funding for this vital project. The Flinders Link rail project will extend the Tonsley rail line to Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University, finally connecting the university, the medical centre and the Tonsley innovation precinct with the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $125 million project is jointly funded by the Morrison and Marshall Liberal governments, and it's important in so many ways. It's important because it will reduce congestion on our roads by giving local residents a new public transport option. It's important because it will ease parking pressures at Flinders Medical Centre for patients, families and medical staff, and help them to get there more easily. It will also help staff and students get to Flinders University more safely and easily, and, again, it will ease congestion and parking pressures. It's important because it will finally connect the Flinders precinct with the city, particularly the medical facilities along North Terrace such as the SAHMRI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most importantly, this project will unlock a $1.5 billion investment by Flinders University that will create thousands of construction and then permanent jobs on the site. This has been enabled by our relatively small state and federal government investment of $125 million, which, to my mind, is the very best sort of government investment in infrastructure. It means that Flinders University will be able to create the biggest integrated health and education precinct in South Australia, leveraging other funding.

The Oaklands Crossing road and rail grade separation is almost fully complete, and the train has been operating completely separate to the road for some months now. I still can't quite believe I managed to secure the funding commitment for this project and see the project almost fully delivered in my first term.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate and recognise this very important price review that has transpired giving significant benefits to those who provide services under the NDIS. The history of the NDIS is quite remarkable. We've seen a very rapid development of one of the greatest social reforms in Australia's history. We started with as few as 30,000 participants. That has increased to around 300,000 now. To see that occur has been an incredible challenge for both sides of politics and the Public Service. We have seen an increase in the number of providers—at the moment as many as 20,000—and have projected that this is a remarkable area of skills need for the nation. But it's all about those who are receiving support, many for the first time—around 100,000 of the 277,000 clients we have under the NDIS. Many of those are in electorates of those here today. They are looking at this period of transition, often with delays that have been of great concern, particularly in states where they have staged the rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Queensland, over that three-year period, some of the largest population areas were switched on only in July last year. That put an enormous burden on those who were ensuring that the NDIS was fit and ready for service. As a result of this transition from state based services, and from block funding, to the NDIS there are in fact fewer than was projected. The expected numbers were to be increased in excess of 300,000. But for many, certainly in South East Queensland, the delays were not insignificant. For the providers there were concerns around price. That brings me to why we are here today. The price review was essential to make sure that those who are providing are able to do so in a range of geographic conditions within Australia. While money has been announced in programs and support, what has been lacking in many cases has been an ability to deliver remote and very remote services—</span>

                  </a>  Yes, I will take that interjection—and to meet the needs of cancelled services. All those things, particularly therapy assistance, were identified as amounts that needed to be assessed. I'm glad that's occurred. The government is committed to continuing to work with NDIA and state and territory governments. A lot of passion brought together this great service. It's been a big shift, as I pointed out. What's more important than anything is the financial stability of this great institution. In many cases, even in my electorate, there are areas where the providers felt they couldn't deliver a service in a viable way without significant changes and restructures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is absolutely important that we had a price review. I commend the significant increases in payments as a result of the review, particularly for attendant care and community participation; the new temporary transformation payments to enable those who worked under block funding arrangements to move to the new system, allowing therapy workers to be reimbursed for long journeys between patients and clients and for cancellations; and the increased amount of time that can be charged for in remote and very remote settings, as I pointed out. Finally, I want to commend the Australian people for never having hesitated in making sure that this great service has been made available from one coast to the other and is now finding its feet in every corner of the nation since the final rollouts occurred in the middle of last year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  Listening to the rhetoric of this government and the substance of this motion one is given a clear demonstration of how out of touch the Liberals are—dismissing criticisms and then trying to give the impression that the NDIS is perfect. The member for Bowman speaks of delays and fewer participants than projected. Member for Bowman, the reality is that the Liberals have ripped $1.6 billion out of the system, leaving people with disability and those who care for them without the proper support they need. The Liberals are deliberately underfunding the NDIS so that they can prop up their budget position, and they are doing it at the expense of Australians with disability and their families and their carers. The effect of this underspend is that NDIS participants are, on average, $20,000 worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Liberals' maladministration and lack of any leadership, people are falling through the cracks as the NDIS is rolled out. This is the consistent feedback of NDIS participants, providers, carers and state and territory governments. The very poor implementation of this scheme is clear from the state of the agency responsible for its implementation—without a CEO and with a mass exodus of its senior leadership in the past months; with a staffing cap that means longer waiting times and less access to services for NDIS participants; and with a substantial lack of proper representation and understanding at the staff and board level of lived experience of disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen countless examples across the country of the real world impact that the Liberals' cuts and neglect have had, including families who can only get a response from the NDIA or the Liberal government when they start a community campaign, exposing the neglect—like Angus and his mum in Queensland who relied on a wheelbarrow for transport on the family farm because he couldn't get access to a suitable wheelchair; or Kayla, a university student in Penrith, west of Sydney, who was born with spinal muscular atrophy, who has started a GoFundMe page to get a car so she can travel independently; or Tim, in Tasmania, who lived with severe epilepsy and who died while waiting for the NDIA to deliver vital medical equipment; or a wheelchair-bound man with progressive spastic paraplegia, initially told he 'wasn't disabled enough'; or the countless people with disability who end up in hospital because they don't have suitable NDIS plans; or the inconsistent and inadequate transport arrangements, like the cap on subsidies in Tasmania that will leave people with disabilities isolated. That shows how little regard the Liberal government have for people with disability, their families and their carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, the Labor Party will stand up for people with disability and their families and their loved ones. We will make sure the government's neglect is exposed, and we will hold them to account and make sure Australians with disabilities get the care and support they need and deserve. Labor welcomes the increases, which are part of 25 recommendations from a July 2018 independent price review. It is heartening to hear that funding in existing participants' plan will be adjusted to reflect those price increases, but I'm far from confident that those adjustments will be expeditious. One participant who contacted my office on 12 July said that she had said not received that adjustment to her account and she and wasn't optimistic, given that she had waited four months for a call from the NDIA to complete an access request for her three-year-old daughter with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past 12 months of the NDIS rollout have been marred by delays and roadblocks for participants and their carers. It is telling that 'participants' were referred to only once by the member for Bowman in his motion and 'carers' did not get a single mention. This government built its surplus from the anguish and despair of those attempting to secure support through the NDIS—support they deserve and urgently need. The government's price increases answer the needs of service providers but they do nothing to resolve the lack of crisis response facilities, long waiting lists and overly complex processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have many questions to answer. What will they do to address the delays and backlogs? Will they lift the staffing cap? What is their plan to improve employment outcomes for people with disability? What is their plan to ensure there are enough qualified workers in the sector? What is their plan to fix the plagued IT system?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When will they appoint a new CEO? Will it be someone with knowledge or lived experience of disability? The tenure of half of the NDIS board expires in October. What is their plan for having a more representative board? How will this government make it easier for those with intellectual disabilities to access the scheme?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Participant planning and reviewing processes must be improved. This is urgent. Transport arrangements must be improved. Employment supports must be improved. Support for people with complex needs and people living in remote areas must be improved. This government's key objective must be to give all people with disability equal access to the NDIS. To do so, it is time to focus on participation and service delivery, not on providers and prices.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  It is wonderful to be able to get up and respond to this important motion from the member for Bowman because, like him, I am concerned about those most vulnerable in the community and also concerned about making sure we provide particularly those people with a disability with the care, support and assistance they need. But we also need to be honest about the pathway to do so. We just heard from the previous speaker about how we shouldn't be concerned about things like dollars and cents. I can understand from an opposition that didn't fund the NDIS why they would take so little interest. They judge a policy not by its outcomes, and seemingly not even by whether it is funded, but simply by their good wishes and intent. The tragedy of that is that it might give them good political selling points for their constituents and it might create a narrative or an argument that they can give in their social media videos of speeches they give in the Federation Chamber, but it doesn't reflect the lived reality of many people with a disability in our community who so desperately need not just the rhetoric of support but financial resources for that support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What stays an eternal shame and a stain on the legacy of the opposition is that when they last left government they made a promise to people with a disability in this country on what they would deliver but never delivered the funding to do so. That is an eternal stain on their legacy and means their commitment to what they want to do rings hollow.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  I understand that some members are interjecting because when awful truth is reflected back in a mirror it's a difficult and ugly image to look at, but such is the way of things. Our role as the government is to correct the error of their ways and to find a pathway forward that is sustainable for people with a disability in Australia who so desperately need the assistance and support of the NDIS. Those are the challenges that we have confronted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 30 June 2016, the number of people who have relied on the NDIS has grown from 30,000 to 300,000. It's been the rollout of one of the biggest social welfare reforms in this nation—across a continent. I have to say, sadly, that many of the states have not taken the opportunity to rise to the challenge and show their compassion, empathy and financial support to those people as well. They have seen it as an opportunity for retreat. We have had to fill in every gap but also make sure that we have done so while protecting those most vulnerable and protecting and respecting the contribution of Australian taxpayers—because we have seen a massive growth in the number of service providers, from 3,500 to 20,000, over the same period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing Australians want more than to be able to provide support and assistance to people with a disability. That is true. But it will destroy their confidence in and support for such programs if they see service providers profiteer in a malicious way or rip off people with a disability who are vulnerable and can't otherwise support themselves. That's why we have been prudent and responsible in the way we have implemented the NDIS and why there has been so much shame in many of the states that have seen it as an opportunity to cost-cut and retreat as the federal government has entered into the space. It's to make sure that those pricing structures keep meeting the expectations of many of the service providers who are so dependent on the NDIS—that's the point of this motion. We judge a policy not just by its intent but by its outcomes and the government's preparedness to back it up with secure financial resources. I speak often to groups in the Goldstein electorate like Bayley House, under the leadership of Warwick Cavanagh, and Marriott Support Services, under Janine Simpkin. Each one of them works day in and day out to improve the lives of people with a disability so they can live with purpose and dignity. What we in this place owe those people is honesty and the truth, and that is what this government is delivering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  To listen to the government speak about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, you'd think the system was perfect and just needed minor tweaks. Well, if that were the case, I wouldn't get emails from mums of kids with autism, or any number of complex disabilities, at the end of their tether, trying to get basic supports. I wouldn't get angry dads who've spent literally days of their lives on the phone trying to finalise a plan. I wouldn't have providers of services grimly tell me about how the plan gaps compromise their cash flow and therefore their viability and take an inordinate amount of unfunded time to resolve. Nor would my office be in the top two of advocates to the NDIA about participant problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's get clear: we welcome improvements to the system—including some fee increases and recognition of transport costs for regional and rural areas—but, frankly, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury still have too many of our services come from Penrith, and we are considered part of the city, yet it can take an hour and a half to get to a participant. And, for an area like mine, the paltry mobility allowance put into plans—as very few incorporate transport—means that my transport providers are struggling to absorb the vehicle running costs, and participants risk being marooned at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence of underspending $1.6 billion is all these problems, plus the fact that early intervention simply hasn't happened for many families. We will not let slide the fact that this government is propping up its budget with money that should have been spent on people with disabilities, with participants on average $20,000 worse off. Why are people's reviewed plans, in their second or third year, much less than the previous year, when nothing else has changed? Why are the delays in reviews so long? Is it deliberate savings from participants, is it a result of inconsistent rules and inconsistently trained staff, or is it just a consequence of the staffing cap?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One person who has spent days of his life trying to finalise plans for his children is Chris from Blaxland. His story is a litany, over the course of three months, of waiting on phone lines, not receiving promised phone calls or emails, more paperwork, poor communication and disappointment. I'm grateful to him for sharing with me the detail and his suggestions on how to improve the system. This government owes him and so many other parents an apology for stuffing them around for months at a time. Parents tell me they'd like to see things like a minimum standard of training for plan managers, who should have at least some experience of working in the disability sector. They want better access to information, including a vetted list of NDIA-approved providers that shows what services are available in specific areas. When you're servicing participants in a 4,000-square-kilometre electorate, a service available in one part of the electorate isn't necessarily going to be there in another. It's clear to me that parents need better support mechanisms to help them negotiate the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this should be rocket science, but you need a stable agency running it. Without a CEO, and given the mass exodus of senior leadership in recent months, it's hard to see that happening anytime soon. You also need proper representation and understanding, at the staff and board level, of lived experience of disability. It's another big gap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Service providers are also aware of the problems. New Haven Farm Home, who provide supported living in Freemans Reach and Richmond, have raised with me a number of issues they face as they try to do their best by their participants, and I thank them for allowing me to visit their homes. Members of the Blue Mountains Disability Roundtable, which meets monthly to compare notes and advocate for improvements to the system, point out that, on top of the general problems being faced around the country, the Penrith office, which serves the mountains and Hawkesbury, has issues that are not experienced in other regions, including ongoing plan gaps. They point to significant delays in decision-making and processing information. All of that means that they don't get paid, while still delivering services to the participants. They don't want to see people miss out on vital services. And they wear the cost from their own cash flow, hoping that the delayed plan will make it up eventually. It doesn't always. What's more, the time it takes to resolve the issue is not funded in any way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The round table—which is made up of a range of organisations, including Blue Mountains Food Services, EMPOWERability, NADO, DARE Disability Support, McCall Gardens and SEE Foundation—said there is no working complaint system. It shows me that this Prime Minister and this government do not understand the magnitude of this issue.</span>

This is not an easy job. It's not an easy rollout. My friend has gone about his business in a calm, methodical manner. I have absolutely no doubt that the oversight committee will play a very important role in the years to come, and I hope to be a part of that for some time to come.</span>

I've gathered feedback from hundreds of participants in the NDIS, of which my daughter is one. However, sometimes one individual's story can go a long way to making clear the issues in a huge scheme like the NDIS, and today I want to focus on one of those stories.</span>

Kylie is the founder of Chatter-boxes, a nurturing speech pathology practice in Minyama. She's a dynamic, modest, practical and highly engaged business leader, and I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate her on the fantastic local business that she has created.</span>

She described how she is already employing new local therapists to deal with the demand from people who had not previously been able to receive this level of government support. Kylie's story, like that of so many I heard during my time on the NDIS committee, was, indeed, a positive one, of new jobs being created, new services being offered and support being provided to people who might never otherwise have received it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Kylie had some concerns about how the program was to be implemented, and I've been working with her and with the NDIA to explore those. As this motion describes, I'm pleased to say that the government and the NDIA—and, in fact, the oversight committee—have, since our meeting, acted to deal decisively with many of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kylie explained to me that, while she would like to be able to have her team travel more to their patients, to deliver therapy in a familiar and comfortable setting, 20 minutes of travel time is not sufficient in a regional area like the Sunshine Coast. I was therefore pleased to see that, in June this year, the government announced increases in provider travel caps from 20 minutes to 30 minutes in metropolitan areas and from 45 minutes to 60 minutes in regional areas. These changes will mean that more providers like those in my electorate will be able to travel to deliver care in the most effective location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kylie also explained that, while the NDIS's current pricing structure for therapies was adequate on the Sunshine Coast, without further review and increases over time many providers would soon face tough times. That's why I was pleased to see the government recently announce significant increases in the base prices for attendant care and community participation, as well as increases of up to 4.5 per cent for supports like assistance with daily activities. The Morrison government has also introduced a new tier of higher prices for those individuals with complex needs which will attract up to 10 per cent in additional loading where it's needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also heartened to see that, following this year's annual review, the NDIA will be improving its processes for future annual price reviews to ensure that it has the full confidence of providers like Kylie and Chatterboxes. Kylie's practice deals with many children, and she expressed concerns to me about the slow pace at which some were gaining access to Early Childhood Early Intervention supports. She explained how these delays not only affect the children concerned but can make efficient forward planning and delivery for providers much more difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With our new six-month plan to resolve delays and backlogs for children, the government took action last month to speed up these processes. This will include standard interim plans, immediate streaming to specialists for participants with complex needs and additional resources where there is most need. The Morrison government is listening to what needs to be done to improve the NDIS, and we will keep doing so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  This is the first time since the election I've spoken in the chamber on a policy issue. I wanted my first contribution to be on the NDIS, so I welcome the member for Bowman's motion. Whilst I commend the member for Bowman for tabling a motion about the NDIS, I find the substance of his motion bizarre, frankly. Basically, it congratulates the agency and the government on some bureaucratic changes in pricing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this motion clearly identifies how out of touch the government is with the realities of the scheme and the lived experience of participants. The feedback I get on a regular basis from my constituents is their absolute frustration in their dealings with the scheme and the agency, and I know I'm not alone amongst members receiving this feedback. Despite their frustration, participants and their families always begin their conversations with me by saying how grateful they are for the scheme, so it is disappointing that they have to detail the ongoing problems they have in navigating the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The area I represent was a pilot area for the NDIS, so we are now six years into the scheme. One of the major issues constituents are reporting to me is that the funding in their plans is being drastically reduced and they are faced with the ordeal of requesting a review of these reductions or negative changes. The main problem is that there are no legislated time frames for these reviews, and waiting months on end for the review to be finalised is causing people immense anxiety and stress. This needs to be addressed as a matter of priority, as plans are expiring and participants are in limbo while they wait for the outcomes of their reviews.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another common complaint is a basic one that can be easily addressed. It is the dreadful difficulty participants have in communicating with the agency. I recently met with a mother who told me she had not had a return call from the agency in years. Remember that these are people who have been in the scheme for six years. When she has contact, it is with contractors and not with employees of the agency. She would go up to the NDIA agency in Charlestown every week and stand next to reception for hours on end just to try to talk to a human. This is a major issue related to the Liberal government ripping $1.6 billion out of the scheme. Participants and their families should be able to have direct and informative communication with the agency, and the agency should be proactive in responding when contact is made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I want to bring some shocking constituent experiences to the attention of the House. One participant was told by a planner that they wanted to see an improvement in her child's autism by the plan's next review. This is truly shocking. Parents of children with disability should not have to endure this horrific ignorance in their dealings with the agency. Unfortunately, this story is very common for parents with kids with autism. They are being told their plans are being cut because their kids' autism diagnosis is not improving. You don't improve and you don't recover from an autism diagnosis; you learn to live with autism and to manage your life and to live as full a life as you can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also met with allied health professionals who provide music therapy as part of this scheme. They had to seek my assistance to get confirmation from the minister that music therapy could be funded as part of the scheme when it was considered reasonable and necessary, because planners at the agency were telling participants it definitely could not be funded. I had to go to the minister only because my parliamentary liaison at the agency was unable to provide definitive advice on this. There is something wrong with the scheme when you have to go to the minister to get a declaration on whether a service is within the scheme's ambit or not. These are just two examples of what should never ever happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first became aware of problems with the scheme when the emphasis shifted in recent years under this coalition government from participants having choice and control of their lives and their plans to them receiving funding that was deemed reasonable and necessary by the agency. This is a fundamental shift in the philosophy of the scheme and has had a major impact on participants' ability to access the assistance the scheme was designed to provide. This change, combined with a massive underspend by the government to prop up the promised surplus, is having impacts on the most vulnerable people in our society and their families and carers. The government should not be congratulating itself or the agency with motions like this. It should be adequately funding the scheme and immediately addressing, as a matter of urgency, some of the issues I've raised today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme is one of the great legacies of Labor governments. It stands there with Medicare. I applaud the current government for continuing to support it, but that support should be full throated, it should be meaningful, it should not involve penny pinching and it should improve the lives of every Australian in the scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I too am honoured to rise in this place to speak on this important subject of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and, in particular, the motion that the honourable member has moved in relation to the pricing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say at the outset that the pricing increases that were announced and came into effect from 1 July this year are significant and are most welcome to both the participants and the providers within the scheme. From 1 July, providers will see increases to remote and very remote plan funding and price limit loadings; changes to billing for travel, cancellations and non-face-to-face services; and a temporary loading for attendant care and community participation supports, including group based supports to assist organisations transitioning to the NDIS. These are important and, as I said, significant price increases in an area which, as many speakers have pointed out during the course of this discussion this morning, is important for the providers of NDIS services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the honourable member for Fisher remarked in his comments prior to this, I had the honour of chairing the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the last parliament. I wanted to take this opportunity at the beginning of this parliament to pick up on some of those things which the committee examined in the last parliament and I hope will continue to examine in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note from the outset that this committee has been in existence from the beginning of the scheme. It provides an important parliamentary oversight on the NDIS, and it is one which has operated in a very friendly, very non-partisan way for the whole operation of the NDIS. I think that's important. Certainly under my chairmanship of the committee, the only recommendations brought forward were those that had the unanimous support of all the members of the committee regardless of their political partisan backgrounds or hue. It was important, I believe, that we came forward as a parliamentary committee representing all shades of the political spectrum in this place with recommendations in relation to improving the operation of the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme is one which is still being rolled out. We're currently at approximately half the number of participants which is ultimately envisaged under the scheme. Some 460,000 to 470,000 Australians will be participants in the scheme when it's finally rolled out, and that involves a huge ramping up of the scheme over the next 12 to 18 months. The reality is that, for many of the participants and their families, this is an excellent scheme that works very well for them. But it's also the sad reality that for a minority—one doesn't know how many, but it is a minority—this scheme is not working in the way in which it was intended, and there's a lot of work that needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an agency which is being built at the very time that the scheme is being rolled out. That in itself spells out some of the enormous challenges that the NDIA—the agency—faces in rolling out the scheme. I think there is goodwill from all parts of the political spectrum. There's certainly goodwill from all parts of the disability sector towards this scheme, but there's also a growing realisation that more needs to be done to overcome some of the basic problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, the committee inquired into eight areas and issued eight reports, including on: the provision of disability services for people with psychosocial disabilities relating to a mental health condition; the approach to early childhood intervention; transitional arrangements for the NDIS; the provision of hearing services under the scheme; market readiness for the provision of services under the scheme; the provision of assistive technology under the NDIS; the ICT systems; and general issues around implementation and performance, which was the last report, tabled in the House on 29 March 2019. I won't go through all the various recommendations that have been made in the reports, but I will say a couple of things. One is that I was delighted and I'm sure the committee and, indeed, all colleagues in this place were delighted that the government has picked up many of those recommendations, particularly those around early childhood. However, there are a series of other recommendations that still need to be fulfilled. I hope the committee will continue to look at this and ensure that we have the best possible scheme for disabled people in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I too rise to speak on the motion by the member for Bowman and to strongly condemn the Liberals and Nationals for their many and continued failures in the NDIS. When the NDIS is working well for people it is changing lives, but for far too many people it is just not working at all. The rhetoric of this government and the substance of this motion demonstrates just how out of touch the Liberals and Nationals really are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst for many the rollout is meeting their needs and working effectively, there is still substantial work required to urgently address delays and inadequacies in the NDIS operation and rollout. The most common source of complaints to my office is the NDIS. The fact is that many people with disability, their carers and their families are desperate for assistance. The reality is that the Liberal-Nationals government has ripped $1.6 billion out of the NDIS, leaving many people with disability and those who care for them without the support they need. Six years of this government's cuts, chaos and staffing caps has undermined the NDIS, and this has had devastating effects. People are getting poor-quality plans, services are being pushed to the brink and waiting times are completely unacceptable. The deliberate underfunding of the NDIS to prop up the budget bottom line is at the expense of Australians with a disability and their families and carers, and this has real life consequences. The effect of this underspend is that, on average, NDIS participants are now $20,000 worse off, with over 77,000 people missing out on the NDIS this year alone. The government has capped NDIS staff and starved the NDIS of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Richmond is the case of 10-year-old Josephine. This is one distressing example of the real-life consequences of a scheme that is not working for the people who need it most. Josephine has a rare condition called giant axonal neuropathy. This neurodegenerative disease progressively causes paralysis, and Josephine needs an electric wheelchair to attend school and participate in other activities. I am advised that Josephine met the NDIS access requirements in 2016 and her plan approved the purchase of an electric wheelchair, a beach wheelchair, a specialised foam bench, an electric bed, a walker, a bilateral supportive lounge chair and other essential therapies, including hydrotherapy. Despite the NDIS approving this vital equipment and prescribed essential therapy by qualified medical professionals over three years ago, Josephine is yet to receive the disability support she desperately needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delay in obtaining equipment through the NDIS has caused devastating long-term consequences for Josephine and considerable stress and anxiety for her family. The flow-on effects have had adverse impacts on all her family members, including on her mother, who has suffered multiple hernias which have been attributed to the physical lifting of Josephine. Without the new NDIS approved electric wheelchair, Josephine is unable to return to school or participate in other activities with her peers. According to her local paediatrician, the deterioration in Josie's condition has accelerated because she has not had access to the equipment she needs. I have made urgent representations to the minister and, again, I call upon him to act on this matter urgently and fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another local constituent of mine, Tim, who suffers from incomplete quadriplegia and often uses a wheelchair, was told he wasn't disabled enough to access the NDIS. He recounted his NDIS experience as destabilising, disappointing and damaging to his physical and mental health and general wellbeing. How could anyone with a disability have faith or confidence in the NDIS when it requires people to justify their disability and then repeatedly reprove their disability through lengthy and delayed reviews? The fact is the NDIS is in crisis under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I co-hosted an NDIS forum in my electorate with Senator Keneally to hear from local clients and providers about their NDIS experiences. Overwhelmingly, the feedback I received from locals is that the administrative barriers and delays continue to act as some of the greatest hurdles in accessing the benefits and aims of the scheme. Some of that feedback included unacceptable delays to having plans finalised and services delivered, unacceptable delays in plan reviews, with some clients waiting over 12 months for their reviews, and also inconsistencies in assessments from one year to the next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals and Nationals, Labor will always support people with a disability and their families. We designed and built the NDIS, and we understand how important it is that it is actually working properly. So I'm urging the government, on behalf of the people in my electorate and indeed right across Australia, to provide adequate funding and resources for the NDIS. They're desperately needed. The fact is the NDIS must be successful. It must work properly to be able to effectively provide the support, the care and especially the dignity that people in our communities need and deserve.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're back in surplus. We've maintained our AAA credit rating. We are growing faster than any country in the OECD bar, of course, the United States. We have 27 years of continuous economic growth, a $100 billion infrastructure plan, record spending on health and education and the single largest recapitalisation program in the history of the Australian Defence Force. The stats just keep on going, but the question has to be asked: how are we doing this? How are we continuing to outpace others internationally, and how do we continue to fund record spends on vital public services, infrastructure and defence? The answer obviously lies in a strong economy, which, of course, is the means by which we deliver these things and not the endgame itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key points of our strong economy is the fact that we are an open liberal democracy, highly integrated with the international global marketplace—a bold country that is prepared to trade with and invest in our neighbours. In recent years, as most people know, we have concluded free trade agreements with some of the biggest players in our region: China, Japan and Korea. Of course, Australia was also instrumental in ensuring that the TPP-11 deal was concluded. As it stands, about 70 per cent of our trade now is with countries with whom we have a free trade agreement, and this is wonderful news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reason I stand today, as reflected in the terms of this motion, is to celebrate the fact that in May this year we had the greatest results in our history when it came to our monthly trade surplus, at $5.7 billion. What's more—what members of the chamber here might be interested in—is that the highest performing five months of trade surpluses were all in this year. In 2018, we had record exports of $438 billion. So trade has contributed around a quarter of Australia's economic growth over the past five years. These are all very big statistics and big figures, but it translates into opportunities for businesses and jobs. Fifty-three thousand businesses in Australia—small, medium and large—export to the world. With that, of course, come countless jobs and opportunities, and that is why this record result with our trade surplus is so vitally important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind that, of course, lie human stories. I know this from personal experience. My first job internationally was as a teenager working in greater China, selling Australian wheat flour. I knew that every bag of wheat flour I would sell would actually be transacted through someone in an office in Wooloowin, in Brisbane. The wheat flour would be customised to that marketplace by people at Acacia Ridge, and it would come out of a mill in Albion. It would be good, hardworking Australians and their families who would win every single time I'd sell a bag of wheat flour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what it's all about. We have thousands of Australians exporting our products and generating jobs because Australians, in our DNA, know that we have something unique. It is why we punch above our weight. It is why we are the most innovative free market economy in the world despite our relatively small size. It's also why, as much as I'm proud of those big free trade agreements—particularly with Japan, China and Korea—I encourage members of this chamber to support other free trade agreements as they come before the House, including, of course, with Peru, Indonesia and Hong Kong, which are on their way, and as we continue to prosecute the case of Latin American FTAs and FTAs with Europe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  Labor supports this motion by the member for Fairfax. Australia is one of the world's great trading nations, and the fact that Australia has been recording trade surpluses is, of course, pleasing. It is a good thing, but I would caution those opposite about too much self-congratulation. These trade surpluses are, as most know, due to the near doubling of the world iron ore price from US$69 a tonne to the current US$121 a tonne in the last six months. This price rise is due to a number of factors, including Beijing's economic stimulus program and a dam bursting in Brazil, neither of which have anything at all to do with those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up in the Northern Territory, we pay attention to trade because we are closer, both physically and psychologically, to those growing Asian markets than perhaps the rest of Australia. These markets are vital for the economic development of northern Australia and, in particular, Darwin, the place that I represent, which has long been regarded as Australia's gateway to Asia. I was honoured that the leader of the Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, appointed me to head a task force on northern Australia and increasing trade with our near region in South East Asia and the Asia-Pacific. I will be working closely with the shadow minister for trade, Madeleine King, and the shadow minister for northern Australia, Senator Murray Watt, as we try to convince those opposite in the Morrison government of the merits of developing the north from a strategic and economic point of view. There has been so little done by those opposite in developing the north since a white paper was released some five years ago that we've started a Senate inquiry into just what has been achieved in five years of the 'developing the north' rhetoric from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor went to the last election with a coherent and costed policy for Darwin and the Northern Territory. The election results for me and the member for Lingiari are proof that the people of Darwin and Palmerston could see the merit in our proposals. A specific proposal, of building a ship lift for both defence and civilian use, was high on the agenda. This important part of strategic infrastructure would result in ships, whether they be from our region or Australian vessels, undergoing routine maintenance and refits in Darwin rather than sailing away to Cairns or Singapore. This would mean a significant improvement in our defence infrastructure and capability in northern Australia and also jobs for Territorians. I call on the government to take up this proposal and build the ship lift in Darwin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Northern Territory government is pursuing an ambitious international engagement, trade and investment strategy. The Territory's annual exports to Japan are worth $2.6 billion, to China, $1.4 billion, and to Indonesia, $320 million. We have huge trade opportunities in defence, space, agribusiness, energy, international education, rare earth minerals and tourism, to name just a few. We also have huge competitive advantages: proximity to Asia, land, water and mineral resources, local expertise, people-to-people relations and a young and culturally diverse population. Darwin truly is the gateway to Asia. I encourage all members to join us on 9 September for Facing North here in Parliament House—put a note in your diary—and learn some more about northern Australia's strategic and trading capital of Darwin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do celebrate trade and we welcome this motion. We do have a proud record in trade, and I think both sides can point to the past where we have had great trading agreements reached. What I would caution those opposite on doing, though, is pursuing trade agreements for the sake of it, for the sake of a news grab, because, at the end of the day, trade deals should be more about the national interest than just getting a news grab. I commend the member's motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In about 1800 a gentleman by the name of David Ricardo came up with the idea of comparative and absolute advantage when it came to trade. He realised that trade was not only beneficial to nations just because you were able to produce goods or services—mostly goods at that time—more efficiently than your trading partner and, therefore, trade with them; he realised that, even when you do it less efficiently than your trading partners, it is still beneficial to both countries to trade. The benefits of trade are enormous. We only talk about the economic benefits in this place, unfortunately. When they were talking about the Corn Laws in the United Kingdom between 1810 and 1850, Malthus was saying that we should drive up the price of food so that people on lower incomes—or, as he called them then, poor people—would not be able to afford as much food because, as he said, we were reproducing human beings at a much faster rate than our capacity to grow food. So he was very much in favour of the Corn Laws. However, Ricardo was able to show that this was short-term thinking. But the primary reason was not economic; the primary reason was actually peace. Ricardo, William Wilburforce and people like Pitt the Younger always felt that, if England could trade with France, the likelihood of them continuing to fight wars would decrease.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the end of World War II, the architects of modern Europe and what became known as the EU were not primarily after economic benefits; they were after peace dividends. They realised that, if Germany and France's economies could be drawn closer together, the incentives for there being war would massively decrease. In our lifetime, it is inconceivable that Germany and France would go to war, though anything is possible. We may send the member for Solomon to sing in a Berlin bar at some point wearing a safari suit—and that could set off God knows what chain reactions. But, in the unlikelihood that that would ever happen, it is inconceivable that those two countries would ever go to war. That has primarily been because of trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about trade in the Western world or in the developed world, we think about how that has sometimes impacted the real wages of people who were in semi-skilled or low-skilled labour. Indeed, in the United States, real wages for people in the bottom 60 per cent of the income curve have not seen a material wage increase since the mid-eighties. That was primarily because, at the end of the eighties, we opened the world, through the World Trade Organization, to countries like China and a billion low-skilled workers became part of the international labour market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think about it in terms of the impact and the cost to people in places like the United States and Western Europe but what we don't think about is the poverty we ended in so many places around the world. In my lifetime, since 1990, we have lifted nearly 2½ billion people out of poverty—and not the sort of poverty where you can't afford the latest iPhone; the sort of poverty where mothers would have to choose between feeding themselves and feeding their children. Free trade has lifted more than two billion people globally out of backbreaking poverty. We have done more in shifting people out of poverty over the last 30 years than all the United Nations programs tried and failed to do from the 1950s onwards. It is a modern miracle and one we do not spend enough time talking about. When we come into this place and talk about our trade surpluses, our free trade agreements and how well the Australian economy is doing, it is right and proper we do so, but I don't want us to ignore the fact that free trade in so many other places in the world has been the difference between life and death and war and peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak on the motion and I thank the member for Fairfax for bringing it. There is no dispute that trade is vital to Australia; we're a trading nation and it is core to our economic wellbeing. It plays an important role in our global and regional engagement. Fair and free trade is in our national interest, is consistent with our values and, done well, should be a tide that lifts all boats. It's widely acknowledged that trade has a key role to play in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. That's why Australian Labor has always favoured the pursuit of multilateral arrangements rather than being content with the endless 'Ring a Ring o' Rosie' of bilateral preferential trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any case, members should not approach the shaping of Australia's trade future by declaring some kind of blanket support in advance of any particular agreement. That would be a failure of our responsibility as parliamentarians. The last thing we need is mindless cheerleading in relation to matters that are as important and complicated as trade. It was a privilege to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the 45th Parliament and to consider trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, PACER Plus and the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. In the course of those inquiries the JSCOT heard from business, industry, agricultural and civil society stakeholders who called for closer involvement in trade negotiations, as happens in other countries. They called for better information about the opportunities provided by new trade arrangements, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, with more resources to facilitate their participation in trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also a strong consensus from trade experts in favour of independent analysis and modelling of trade agreements, their impacts and their benefits. Indeed, three separate reports from the JSCOT recommended that government adopt the practice of commissioning such independent analysis. So far the government keeps refusing to do so. On all these matters there is room for Australia to do trade agreements much better. On that basis I call on members to support these kinds of improvements so that we get higher quality trade agreements and are better placed to assess them, which is our job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to specific trade agreements I hope it's not deeply shocking to observe that some are not as good as they could be. All of them include provisions that might have been stronger. Many of them nowadays include provisions that probably shouldn't be there at all. That's not least because these days such agreements are not just about trade but also about investment rules, intellectual property and even labour market access arrangements. Not all countries take that approach. The United States, for example, does not make foreign labour access concessions through trade agreements. These other matters have nothing to do with tariffs and quotas and do raise legitimate issues of concern. Under the original TPP, Australia had agreed to provide an effective extension of the monopoly rights for biologic medicines from five to eight years. That could have cost the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme hundreds of millions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also broad concern in the Australian community about investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, provisions—clauses that give foreign companies the right to take action against governments through international tribunals of dubious integrity. Tobacco company Philip Morris used an ISDS in an investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong to sue our government over plain-packaging reforms. That legal action cost Australian taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and only failed because of a jurisdictional issue. If not for that technicality, Philip Morris may well have interfered with one of the most important public health reforms of recent times. As it was, New Zealand didn't proceed with their own plain-packaging laws for three years while awaiting the outcome of the Philip Morris case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other countries there have been successful challenges against environmental and workplace laws. ISDS has become a mechanism by which multinationals protect their profits by interfering in the sovereign capacity to govern and make policy for the public good. That's why Labor doesn't support the inclusion of ISDS in trade agreements. This government shouldn't either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion does refer to jobs. Trade agreements don't automatically produce jobs. In a relatively high-wage, developed economy like ours, trade can deliver economic growth while still causing jobs to shift elsewhere. Members might reflect on the analysis commissioned by the World Bank on the original TPP, which estimated Australia would lose 38,000 full-time jobs. They should also remember that this government's been using trade agreements to weaken our temporary foreign labour arrangements, allowing contractual service providers to bypass labour market testing provisions. No-one in this place should rush to become a cheerleader in advance of trade agreements. Members would do well to consider the non-trade aspects of recent agreements and ask themselves whether they're really in the national interest. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  As the member for Goldstein, it's a great pleasure to get up and endorse the words and the vision of the member for Fairfax in supporting this motion. Can I start by recalling my incredible disappointment in the previous speaker and his speech. I fully understand that Labor MPs struggle with understanding the common benefit to the entire Australian community from freer and more open markets and trade agreements. The last time they were in government, they were led by a trade minister—the most failed trade minister in Australian history, I personally think, in Craig Emerson—who failed throughout his entire tenure. He spent all his time waxing lyrical and distancing himself off to Geneva under multilateralism, with a lack of understanding of the benefits of what can be done in compounding the benefits of bilateral agreements towards multilateral agreements. We heard this all the time. It was insufferable for somebody as passionate about free and open markets as myself to see the failure of the Labor governments and what they delivered for the Australian community versus the actions and outcomes of the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what has transcended since there was a change of government from Labor to the coalition—not just that but the ambition that we now share for what we can do for our country. Yes, we've had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Last year we had $48.3 billion in surplus and $5.7 billion in May alone—a record. But it's not just dollars and cents that bring about the benefits of freer trade. Of course there is the export of goods, but, increasingly, the opportunity that we can secure for our free trade agreements is greater market access for investment and for our service exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a trend since the beginning of Federation: the vast majority of Australians are employed in service based industries. To realise the potential of that human capital and what we can take to the world, and to build their skills and opportunity, whether it's engineers to build new buildings or architects or legal services or financial services—a sector that was nothing but in the crosshairs of the Labor opposition at the last election—we are backing these industries to grow and achieve market access. They are not just building the economic capacity of the country; they are building the skills, the knowledge, the experience and the exposure for us to be globally competitive in our goods and services, least of all because one of the great unsung benefits of freer trade is the potential for the transfer of technology. And Australia has largely been a technology taker—not always, but often. So our capacity to integrate newer technology into our businesses and our systems to make us more competitive is a critical part of the national conversation. That's why this government is so aggressive in continuing to pursue FTAs and bilateral agreements—and now, increasingly, regional agreements not just through the TPP but across many of our neighbour partners. And the Prime Minister has a big focus on what we can do to reform the World Trade Organization so that it meets the ambition and capacity of the 21st century. Of course, the WTO was set up as a successor to the GATT on the basis of much of the politics of the 1990s. And we know, through the leadership of countries like Australia since then, that the discussion has shifted and that the rules need to shift in part with it to make it relevant for our times. We shouldn't discount its potential and its contribution, particularly against the backdrop of what it can be for dispute resolution. To be fair to the Labor members sitting on the other side, they did that in the late eighties and early nineties, through the late, great Bob Hawke. I call upon them to relive that spirit and see the potential of what we can do through FTAs and multilateral instruments, and to build the economy that Australia needs for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So now is not a time not for remorse or simply raising our concerns about why things cannot be done; it is a time for looking at why things can be done. We have secured trade deals with so many of our trading partners in the region. We are now looking further afield—in particular, across the Pacific to South America—and there is so much further to go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Fairfax. I note that he and I worked together on the report <span style="font-style:italic;">From little things big things grow: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">upporting Australian SMEs go global</span>. It was great to work with him on that report, and I will return to that directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not surprising that the member for Fairfax has brought this motion today spruiking the trade surplus that Australia is currently enjoying. Although they are about to start their seventh year in office next month, good economic news has been very scarce under this coalition government ever since they took office. Their self-promotion material claims they are 'outstanding economic managers', yet there has been little evidence to back this up. It is therefore unsurprising that the member for Fairfax has grabbed some good figures with both hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that Australia has recorded record trade surpluses this year, but we need to look a bit closer to understand why we are seeing these record trade surpluses. As the member for Goldstein pointed out, most Australians work in the service industries. So are skilled manufacturing exports or education booming? I ask that question rhetorically to the member for Goldstein. No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Tim Wilson:</span>
                  </a>  Why?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  The member for Goldstein knows that what is driving these figures are the depleted stockpiles of iron ore in China and the fallout from the Brazil mine disaster, so it is incredibly disingenuous for the coalition government to claim credit for these trade surplus figures. The mine disaster in Brazil was a terrible tragedy that claimed the lives of almost 300 people when a tailings dam collapsed in January. Vale, the Brazilian mining company responsible, has just agreed to large compensation payments to the families of those killed. The Vale mine is currently out of production. It typically produces about 93 million tonnes of iron ore per year, or about six per cent of the seaborne iron ore market. In simple economics, as any Western Australian member would know, the decreasing supply of iron ore held at Chinese ports has also contributed to the lift in the price of Australian iron ore. There has been an increase of around 46 per cent in the benchmark price for a tonne of iron ore since the Brazilian disaster. So I would remind the member for Fairfax of that line from Donald Horne's book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lucky Country</span>: 'Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck.' And I'm sure those close to the member for Fairfax personify that line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, trade is critical to Australia's prosperity. As an island continent, we have enormous opportunities because we are located on the edge of the fastest-growing region of the world in human history. When it comes to trade agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong, Labor will examine each of these trade deals before offering comment. Labor believes in trade, so we will look at these agreements through that prism. I note the comments of the member for Fremantle, in his speech earlier, about the benefits that trade produces for this nation. It is always important to protect our national interest, including when it comes to employment issues, obviously. The devil is always in the detail with any agreement, and trade agreements should be looked at very carefully. The member for Fairfax and I have looked at that, in terms of a longer term look by the parliament at such agreements. Hopefully that will come to fruition in this parliament as well. It is always important that we look at the agreement as a whole and look with a view to protecting Australia's interests. Labor has had some issues with the government's proposed free trade agreements in the past. Labor believes in trade, but having a commitment to being a trading nation does not mean you give away your sovereignty or that you don't examine each issue, particularly with regard to jobs being created here in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament I was the Deputy Chair of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which was chaired by the member for Fairfax. We conducted an inquiry into access to free trade agreements. The report, <span style="font-style:italic;">From little things big things grow: supporting Australian SMEs</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">go global</span>, was tabled back in February. It contained 10 recommendations to the government, including a recommendation 'that the Australian government makes its free trade agreements more user-friendly for Australian small and medium enterprises'. This is an important recommendation for Australian businesses, including some businesses in my electorate of Moreton who attended a committee roundtable and gave evidence to that inquiry. Thus far there has been no indication of a response from the Morrison-Frydenberg government to that report.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good news that we are seeing record trade surpluses, but the government can hardly claim that it is because of their economic management. Rather than trying to claim credit where it is not due, the government should actually concentrate on managing the economy. Let's have a look at the fact that engineering construction is down; new car sales are down; retail sales are down; wages are flatlining, and the coalition seem to have lost the defibrillators; productivity growth is mediocre, according to the actual Productivity Commission; and unemployment is a full percentage point higher than in Britain, the US and New Zealand. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to propose this private member's business about penalty rates. On 1 July 2017, penalty rates across several casualised industries were cut for the first of many times. This included industries like hospitality, pharmacy, fast food and retail. The following year, on 1 November 2018, casual workers had more cuts to their wages, leaving them around $77 per week worse off. On 1 July 2019, just weeks ago, the next round of penalty rate cuts were introduced, and on 1 July next year it will be the same story. By the time these cuts are fully implemented, on 1 July next year, some workers will be up to $26,000 worse off. Just let that sink in—$26,000. The Prime Minister probably doesn't know what it's like to be $77 a week worse off, but many people do. First as Treasurer and now as leader of our country, the Prime Minister has presided over the lowest wage growth since records began. That's an astounding claim, and it's true. Yet he and the Liberals and Nationals voted eight times in parliament to cut workers' take-home pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Fair Work Commission recommended the parliament cut penalty rates in 2017, they did so under the belief and impression that it would create jobs, and that's a fair enough assumption. While recognising these cuts would affect low-paid workers and vulnerable workers, the Fair Work Commission stated the decision would 'increase employment and have a number of positive effects on business'. Like a lot of my colleagues, I disagreed with that. Although the national unemployment rate is alarming—and even more so in regional areas like my seat of Paterson and the Hunter region more broadly—the solution to this crisis should not and cannot be at the expense of our lowest-paid workers. After countless attempts to stop them, the Turnbull-Morrison government again voted to introduce penalty rate cuts in full. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia and reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 26 April this year, not one single job has been created. And there's the real rub. We thought that, yes, as a trade-off, there might be some jobs created if the penalty rates were cut. We doubted it, and we were right to doubt it. Not one single job has been created. Two years and three penalty rate cuts later there is not one single job. The Liberal-National government has got it so wrong, and low-paid people are suffering and paying because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At last count there were 12,462 people in my electorate who had been affected by cuts to these penalty rates. Across the Hunter region more broadly, that number rises to a staggering 34,900 people. Contrary to what the government might believe, these are real people with real families who rely on their penalty rates to raise their families; pay their mortgage, if they can afford to have one; pay their rent; pay their electricity bills, which are crippling because of the government's inaction; buy food and pay every other cost that needs to be covered. And we know that those costs go up; you just need to go to the supermarket to see things randomly going up and up and up. People in my community rely on that sum—that penalty rate—to pay for the things they need to survive. When everything's going up except for your wages, the last thing that people need is another cut to their take-home pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point out one exception to this. I want to thank those employers and businesses who see fit to pay higher penalty rates. They understand the value of those employees and they turn their backs on these cuts and say, 'No, no. We understand the value of these employees and we want to remunerate them according to that important value.' I want to thank those employers who are doing that, because that is such an important thing. But I want to condemn this government. You've failed to protect our most vulnerable. You want to make a dollar by taking from those who can least afford it. It is a sham. You've not injected anything into the economy for at least the last six years, and we really need that injection. It's time that this government exercised some economic leadership and stood up for the low-paid and vulnerable people who are really relying on them to govern and not just wedge.</span>

When you think about the lack of trust that many Australians have in their political system today, you only need to look at the motion that sits on the table before us now to know why that trust is in decline. What you have is an opposition that gets up and perpetuates an image and an idea that the government has robbed Australians, when the only thing that stands as a marker is their own legacy of how they created the very situation that they now complain about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not misunderstand: most people wrongly think that politics is about the answers people give—the choice between one type of vision for Australia or another that we want. That is not true. Politics is a choice between the types of questions that people want to ask. Yes, you can have questions like: how do we create a working environment where those people who work enjoy the maximum benefits available to them? Or you can ask: how do we create an industrial relations system to secure maximum employment?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's not be under any misunderstanding: the opposition has always been in the former camp. How do they maximise the benefits for those people who donate to their cause?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They always work towards not the worker but the union member and those who feather their nests, turn up to their polling booths, and game the political system as much as possible for themselves, versus the alternative—which is how we always look at it, as Liberals: how we are going to maximise the number of Australians who can stand on their own two feet, who are in the best position to be able to take care of them and their families and secure the gains of this country for every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we have a record number of Australians working under this government. It's not an accident. It's because it goes to the core of our sense of purpose—why we are in this place: because we want the best, not just for those select few, as the opposition would have it, but for everybody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the dishonesty at the heart of this motion is the fraudulent argument that what they are complaining about is the burden of the government. What they're complaining about is that the Fair Work Commission—that they established, with the rules that they wrote and the commissioner that they appointed—made a decision on the reference they requested and it didn't turn out the way they wanted. And that is the heart and the nub of the matter. And what they want in response is an unconstitutional proposition—that the government gets involved in wage setting. It might make for good social media, interviews and speeches, for the member proposing the motion to get up and speak and show an empathy to constituents who have to suffer the consequences of Labor's commission and Labor's rules under Labor's commissioner, under the decision that they requested. But it's not honest, because they are put aside and cast aside. And to suggest that the pathway is simply to introduce unconstitutional legislation to set wage prices is ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course the trade-off is on trust. We know that it's not just the basis of the motion that they've got wrong; it's almost everything that they've got wrong!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unions and the opposition have claimed that 700,000 employees are affected by the commission they requested, the rules they wrote and the commissioner they appointed—and, of course, the review they requested, and was found wrong by none other than the RMIT/ABC Fact Check. In March 2017, the department estimated that the cuts to Sunday penalty rates were nowhere near what they claimed they would be. It's time for the truth. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  Australian workers' wages are being hammered. Everything is going up, except the wages and incomes of Australian workers. And one of the principal reasons behind that phenomenon is this government's support of cuts to penalty rates for some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. In Kingsford Smith, over 13,000 workers in the retail, fast-food and hospitality sectors saw their penalty rates cut again on 1 July this year. It's a cruel cut that comes at a time when wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living for many families in our community. And it's not only a blow to them; it's a blow to our national economy as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank, in their latest board minutes, stated that wages growth had remained low overall and GDP growth had been well below the trend over the year to the March quarter. One of the reasons for this was that growth in household disposable income had remained low, and this had contributed to low growth in consumption, which was well below average. So weakness in the Australian economy is further proof of the need for the Liberals to stop these ridiculous cuts to penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Deloitte <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Outlook </span>also said that entrenched underperformance of wages under the Liberals isn't going to be disappearing anytime soon. And, as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, the member for Cook has presided over the lowest wages growth since records began. That's not a record that I would want as a Treasurer or a Prime Minister—the lowest wages growth in Australian history since records began. Is it any wonder that Australian families are struggling and not keeping pace with the cost of living?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what has been the Liberals' policy response to sluggish wages growth? It has been to further cut penalty rates for some of the most vulnerable workers in our country. Of course, their theory has been that the reduction in penalty rates would generate more jobs in the economy. The theory, as Labor warned, has not been proven. It has actually been proved wrong. The Council of Small Business Australia acknowledge the fact that cutting penalty rates has not created a single job. When the small business community is admitting that cutting penalty rates has not created one single job in the economy, then you have a problem. The chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia, Peter Strong, is on the record as saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">No new jobs, zip, zero, zilch—that's the reason why there's only been one speaker willing to put their name on the list to come in here and defend the cuts to penalty rates. He's the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. I wouldn't mind betting that he was forced to come in here and defend the government. Not one other member of the government is willing to stump up here in the Federation Chamber and speak in support of cuts to penalty rates, because they know how unpopular the cuts are in the wider community and that all this is is a shameful attack on Australian workers. It's clear that this was always going to be the case, because this government will always put ideology before evidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates aren't a luxury. They're a necessity for millions of Australians to cope with the cost of living in this country. These cuts disproportionately affect women, young people and those without a tertiary education. The cuts mean lower wages for those in a job where they rely on penalty rates to make ends meet. Coupled with increasingly insecure work, this is leaving too many Australians struggling to keep pace with the cost of living. It's simply not fair that many are now earning less each Sunday than they would have before 1 July. That's why Labor condemns this government's failure to act and protect penalty rates for millions of Australian workers who rely on them. The government members and senators who called for or supported those cuts to penalty rates stand condemned. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the government to join with us in making a submission to the Fair Work Commission arguing that penalty rates should be reinstated. Reinstated penalty rates would ensure that industries with a low-income and highly casualised workforce allow their workers to be paid a fair amount and, indeed, have more disposable income so that they can invest in our economy and we can begin to grow the economy at a trend rate and create more jobs for Australian workers. These cuts to penalty rates make no sense. It's been proven that they haven't created extra jobs. The government stands condemned for supporting them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  Cutting penalty rates is a government-sanctioned form of wage theft, pure and simple. It is something that we should resist and fight against. We cannot support seeing the wages of ordinary Australians, the wallets and purses of ordinary Australians, being squeezed to facilitate this form of wealth transfer. Its supposed benefits cannot be supported by the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago, under the coalition government's watch, casualised industries, particularly hospitality, pharmacy, fast food and retail, had penalty rates cut. In November 2018 we saw more casual workers cop a cut of $77 per week. In July this year we had the next round of penalty rate cuts, impacting 700,000 workers all-up. Between Mount Druitt and Blacktown, nearly 12,000 workers will feel the impact of penalty rate cuts. An estimated one in six workers in my part of western Sydney has felt a cut to penalty rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this, according to some business groups, did not create a single job. The supposed benefits are not being delivered. There is no economic benefit that has been seen as a result of this, not a job created. Worse still is what we are seeing in some of the industries that were supposed to have benefited from these cuts. Big W in Western Sydney has started the process of closing down stores, even after penalty rates were cut. Stores are closing down in places like Chullora, Auburn and Fairfield. So, again, all we have seen is ordinary workers lose out and no benefit to the broader economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all because the coalition, in an ideological war against people's wages, decided this through its ginger group. It has also started on superannuation, I see. The same ginger group that argued for this cut and then disappeared, because they won't have any speakers on their side back this, is now saying people's super shouldn't be increased as well. The coalition and some business backers are trying to brainwash others to say this is good for the economy. The facts don't support squeezing money out of pay packets and seeing profits grow at the expense of the wages share within our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something is happening in our economy. Underemployment is a big issue. People don't get the type of work they want. They're not getting full-time work. I think of the woman in Plumpton who grabbed me by the arm and said: 'I can't keep working a part-time job. I don't have a part-time mortgage.' Or I think of the people not getting a wage increase. Wages are hardly growing. If you look, for example, at wages growth, it was 2.2 per cent per annum in the five years to December 2018, but it was 3.3 per cent for the five years leading up to December 2013. Under the coalition's watch, wages are down. Real wages as measured by average weekly ordinary time earnings for adult employees working full-time adjusted for inflation grew only half a per cent per annum in Australia in the five years to December 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unbelievable that this is happening, and some of the commentary around this is equally unbelievable. Last week we had this in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. According to Michael Roddan's interpretation of some Treasury research:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Stubborn employees who refuse to move into more productive companies are a major cause of the nation's record-low wages growth …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> the same day an article was titled 'Don't expect pay rises, warn 40pc of CEOs'. We can't have a situation in the economy where some people will benefit and others won't. We need to be able to work together to ensure that growth and productivity increase but that everyone benefits from this. This has to be a priority. The only way to boost growth and productivity is to have that cooperative mindset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government do not have a clue how to fix this. Their track record based on the stats shows they will not fix this. They can only cut penalty rates, which is wage theft and which is robbing ordinary workers. We need to rethink the rewards system in our economy, get people focusing on this issue and coming up with a solution to this that grows the economy and make sure people's wages rise and that we do not see the economy only grow because we robbed the wages of ordinary Australian workers. It's not good enough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I'm very pleased to support this motion. Thanks to this government, and this Prime Minister, 700,000 low-paid workers in retail, the fast food industry, hospitality and pharmacies are being paid 10 per cent to15 per cent less. Some workers are going to be up to $26,000 worse off by the time these cuts are fully implemented next July. I hate to think about the impact that's going to have on families and small businesses in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. Because of the Liberals, these already low-paid workers are increasingly finding it harder to pay their rent, cover their electricity bills, fill their tanks and look after their families. Because of the Liberals, these workers won't be buying an extra coffee to kickstart their morning. They definitely won't be making all those appointments at the hairdresser and their cars are just going to have to wait a little bit longer for a service. That means the local coffee shop won't be as busy, the corner store will have fewer customers and business will be slowing down at both the hair salon and the mechanic. It will ripple across local economies like those in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals need to understand that less money in weekend workers' pockets doesn't mean there is automatically more money in someone else's. There is no evidence that these penalty cuts have produced a single job, as the Prime Minister promised they would. Even the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia admits new jobs have not been created. Peter Strong, the chief executive of COSBOA said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's no extra jobs on a Sunday …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's been no extra hours. Certainly, I don't know anyone (who gave workers extra hours). It's been just a waste of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the quote—there have been no extra jobs and no extra hours. But there is less income, and that means less to spend. People will struggle more and they will spend less. Pharmacy workers won't work any less hard, but they'll earn less. Young people who bookend their school or uni day and study with paid work in hospitality feel the brunt. Their parents talk to me about their dismay that not only do they not get penalty rates anymore but some employers fail to pay a fair rate at ordinary time. But the young person is so desperate for their first job and to get a foot in the door that they'll take whatever terms are offered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to low-income workers through their penalty rates is not the policy to have at the same time as stagnant wages and an ever-rising cost of living, but it seems the Liberals are happy to see low-paid workers cop another blow to kick off this financial year. On the one hand, the government says the economy needs a boost from tax cuts, yet weekend workers need to work less. So, in some sort of deranged riddle, they stuff one pocket of the low-paid worker with up to $1,000 extra while they take $5,000 out of the other pocket. These cuts to penalty rates continue to be unfair. Penalty rates are not a luxury. Fair pay is not a luxury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Blue Mountains, the penalty rate cuts are just one of the issues undermining our industrial relations system—low wage growth, wage theft and worker exploitation. In the news, jewellery chain Michael Hill underpaid staff by $25 million, chef George Calombaris has had to back pay $7.8 million in wages and super to staff, and the underpayment at Sydney's Shangri-La Hotel comes at the same time we have allegations in the Blue Mountains that a hotel group has exploited migrant workers. It's appropriate that Fair Work is investigating these allegations revealed by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> by Anna Patty. We need to hear the outcome not only of that inquiry but also the audit last year by Fair Work into businesses' compliance in the Blue Mountains with workplace laws, including in the accommodation and food services industries, after a high number of reports by young workers of workplace disputes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every business that underpays its workers is creating an unfair playing field for the many other businesses who do the right thing. I commend the members of the Blue Mountains Union Council for their ongoing work in raising awareness about worker exploitation in the region. If the actions by this or any other employer are found to be illegal, they should face the full force of the law. If the actions are not found to be illegal, then questions must be asked about the adequacy of existing laws to protect all workers from exploitation, whether they are Australians or here on work visas. Regardless of the findings by Fair Work, I expect this case will yet again highlight the inadequacy of current employment protections and provide even more reason for the rules to change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, nine men will die from prostate cancer. Tomorrow, another nine men will die from prostate cancer in Australia. As a matter of fact, this happens every single day of the year. The motion in front of us today is actually about hope that we can do something about that and that the conversation we have as a nation brings us together and encourages us towards further action. One person in my electorate that inspired this motion is a gentleman called David Dyke. David is a prostate cancer survivor. I will talk more about his journey and his innovative way of responding to his diagnosis in a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australian men, this is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer. It's currently the second largest cause of cancer related deaths. It's most likely to affect men over the age of 55, and the risk increases every year. I talked to the library earlier today, and they informed me they don't have the statistics for this parliament, but for the 45th Parliament the average age of men in this place was over 50, at 52. The chances of an average male being diagnosed by his 85th birthday is one in six. Those are our friends, family members, brothers, dads and uncles. That sums up to 19,508 cases every year. In Australia this year, that means that some 3,306 Australians have already died from this cancer. It's something we sadly all have a personal experience of. Indeed, I heard the story of a friend of mine luckily overcoming his battle with prostate cancer. Sadly, I heard this at his funeral. He had battled prostate cancer for some 18 years before passing away from other causes. It is a preventable disease but we all know someone who has been affected by it. On that note, I want to commend the member for Blaxland, who seconds this motion. He has done so much advocacy in this place and across the country in making sure that we continue this discussion, and I look forward to hearing his contribution in a few moments time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a disease that just affects the body; it also affects the mind. The mental health challenges for those who are diagnosed with prostate cancer are immense. We need to remember that what starts physically can often have just as much of a toll emotionally and mentally. Between 2010 and 2014—these are the best statistics we have—some 90,354 men were living with prostate cancer. To put that in perspective, that's almost an entire federal electorate. The strain is huge. The struggle is huge. But, as I said, a gentleman called David Dyke, who lives in Maylands, in my electorate, had a very innovative response. Earlier this year during Men's Health Week, he screened his film <span style="font-style:italic;">Prostate Journey: From Diagnosis to Rehabilitation</span>. I'm pleased that the YouTube link to that film is available in the motion before us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David is an active local in the Perth electorate. David spends his time on many things, including rehabilitating Bardon Park, a beautiful piece of prime riverfront land in the Perth electorate on the Swan River. When he was diagnosed in 2016, David decided that he would start fundraising and arrange an entire film crew to follow him on his journey—not your average reaction but he has made a very moving and incredibly honest film about his experience. It's about his struggle and his struggle with mental health and his call for men to be more active about their health. I studied film in university, and I should admit that I actually dropped out. Making documentaries is hard work. Doing it on a shoestring budget makes it even harder. David put this film together and he launched it at The RISE in Maylands. He has shared it across our community and encourages people to watch the film. It is one of the many ways that we can continue the conversation about making sure that this disease that affects so many is something that eventually becomes part of our history, not our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by commending the work of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. They have many, many patrons. I think it is almost compulsory that if you become a governor or Governor-General, you become a patron. I note that Governor Kim Beazley is a proud patron of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. They do fantastic work. All power to them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion in relation to prostate cancer moved by the member for Perth. I've spoken to this chamber on previous occasions about the It's a Bloke Thing Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation based in my home town of Toowoomba that hosts fundraising and awareness activities to support prostate cancer research, care and education. I'm very proud to represent a community that, in this regard, now supports the largest daytime funding event in Queensland, through the Wagner It's A Bloke Thing Prostate Cancer Luncheon in Toowoomba. In 2018, our community contributed more than $2.23 million through that fundraising luncheon, now making this event one of the largest daytime fundraising initiatives in Australia. Who could possibly forget the surprise guest entertainer last year, Keith Urban, who flew in especially, breaking his program in the United States, to support this particular event, given his own family has been touched by prostate cancer, before immediately returning to the United States. The 2019 event will be held on 6 September at the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the statistic in this motion that there is an estimated one-in-six risk of a male being diagnosed with prostate cancer by his 85th birthday. The It's a Bloke Thing Foundation also reminds us that 1.7 million men will be living with prostate cancer by 2030, 17,729 were diagnosed in 2018 and almost 3,500 men unfortunately lost their battle in 2018. But there is a 95 per cent chance of survival beyond five years if it is detected early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The It's A Bloke Thing Foundation focuses on education. The Prostate Cancer Education Roadshow delivers critical information to rural communities, corporate organisations and public groups throughout regional Queensland, and the intention is to eventually expand that into New South Wales and the Northern Territory. In terms of research, It's a Bloke Thing has supported the peak national body for prostate cancer, the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, for the past five years in a number of their research programs and in their care. Through a partnership with the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, the funding of the first specialist prostate cancer nurse for the Toowoomba, Darling Downs and Darling region is now in place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whether we discuss this issue from the perspective of Western Australia, as the member for Perth has in moving this motion, or, as in my case, from the perspective of Queensland and a program that is attempting to reach across northern Australia into the Northern Territory, this is a particularly important issue for us all to focus on. In line with the motion, therefore, I thoroughly endorse the fact that this House should acknowledge the tireless work of all men's health advocates, especially survivors such as David Dyke—mentioned in this very motion—and particularly those in my community: advocates such as Marcus Barnard and Angie Philp from ANZ, John and Maralyn Fitzgibbons from Fitzy's in Toowoomba, David and Kelli Russell from Wippells Autos in Toowoomba, John and Liz Wagner from Wagners, Gary and Melissa Gardner from FK Gardner &amp; Sons Group, and Michael and Hayley Hubbard from MJH Finance, with Michael being this year's chair of the It's a Bloke Thing advisory committee, the members of which I have just listed. I thank and acknowledge them for raising awareness, alongside so many around our country, about prostate cancer and promoting the importance of men's health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Perth has said, it is indeed vital that men take their health seriously. This is a bloke thing, but it's not just about us. It's about our families; it's about our communities. I therefore enthusiastically support this motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I start by thanking the member for Perth for bringing forward this really important motion for discussion in our parliament. We don't talk about prostate cancer enough. As blokes, generally, we're really bad at looking after our health. We're not great at going and seeing the doctor. We're not great at booking in a regular appointment and making sure that we get a blood test to make sure that everything's okay. We tend to leave it all and just assume that everything's going to be okay or be too afraid to find out that something might be wrong with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly the case with prostate cancer. There's a misinformed view out there in the community that if you go and get a check-up to see if you've got prostate cancer then you've got to get a finger up the backside, and as blokes we say, 'Oh, we don't want that,' so blokes don't get checked up at all. The tragedy in all of that is that that's not true. You can get a really simple blood test. It's called a PSA test. You can get that test as part of your regular blood test that everyone should get once a year as part of checking on cholesterol, diabetes or anything else. Just check it out, particularly if your family has a history of prostate cancer and you're in your 40s. If there is no history in the family, you should be starting to do it in your 50s. That's what David, the gentleman in the video referred to in the motion, did. Just make it a regular part of looking after yourself to make sure that you're okay, because the key with prostate cancer is that in the early stages there are no symptoms, but if you can get it early enough then it's not a death sentence. So the key, to all the blokes watching and listening out there, is: go and get a PSA test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to thank the member for Perth for bringing forward this motion for the parliament to talk about. In particular I want to thank David Dyke, the gentleman who has produced this video that's available on YouTube. I encourage people listening to and watching this debate to click on that video and watch it. It's a very powerful, revealing, personal and honest story that will, hopefully, not only encourage blokes to go and get a PSA test but also help men who have just received a positive test to know what comes next, what their options are and what they can do. The video starts where David's just been told that his PSA levels are elevated and he might have prostate cancer. He goes and sees a specialist, they do a biopsy and they confirm that he does have prostate cancer. Then the doctor talks to him about what his options are and what all the potential side effects are; the side effects are real, and blokes worry about all those different things. David talks about it with his doctor, and, on the video, he tells people what he's up against and what he's got to do. We see the actual operation. We see the camera inside of him and how they remove the prostate cancer. We see all the rehabilitation as he goes through all the exercises to recover and return to a pretty normal life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it's a really personal story but it's important to note that David is not alone. He talks about this being a lonely thing that he has to do himself, but, as the member for Perth and others have said, this is not something that happens to just one or two Australians. More Australians die from prostate cancer every year than from breast cancer. More than 3,000 Aussies will die from prostate cancer this year, and nine will die today. My grandfather died from prostate cancer. Your chances of survival are so much greater if you get it early. That's why taking the blood test, and incorporating it into your regular blood tests, is so important. Remember, David had no symptoms at all but the PSA test saved his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year we do a big barbecue here with the Prostate Cancer Foundation. It's coming up again in September. For the last two years, with Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, we've extended that so that Pathology Australia can run PSA testing for us here in the building. Two years ago 50 blokes in the building did the PSA test. A couple of months later one security guard came up to me and said: 'Thank you for doing that. I've got prostate cancer.' It might have saved his life. Last year 200 blokes did the PSA test. A member of parliament rang me the other day and said: 'Thank you for doing that. I've got prostate cancer.' We've got to get the message out to as many people as we possibly can. Blokes, don't be worried about this; be worried about not looking after your health. Get the blood test and save your life. It's so important and so easy. Click on this video and watch how you can do it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Can I also thank the member for Perth for bringing forward this motion for debate and for sharing Mr Dyke's story with us. It's a truly shocking statistic: nine deaths every day from prostate cancer, including, in the last couple of days, famous tennis player Peter McNamara. He was one of the two Mcs—Peter McNamara and Paul McNamee—who were so famous for winning all those tennis tournaments for Australia. Peter was just 64—my condolences to his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very common story that so many families experience—one of their loved ones being taken from them too early. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge a friend of mine, Katie Woolf, a radio presenter up in Darwin, who lost her father, Rod, to prostate cancer. She has done a heap of work in Darwin raising awareness and funds. Father's Day this year will be the fifth time that Katie and her team have organised the Run with Dad fun run at Darwin's East Point Reserve. If anyone happens to be up in Darwin on Father's Day, come and join in. The funds raised go towards extra prostate cancer nurses for the Top End. It is a great initiative, as is this initiative today from my friend, the member for Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that our health as Australians is generally pretty good, but, as blokes, we do face a lot of challenges to our health. I've become even more aware of that in the last couple of years, working as an ambassador for men's health in federal Labor. A couple of years ago, we had a national male health forum, where we got a heap of fantastic advice on male health from experts around Australia. I say 'male health' because it's the health and wellbeing of young boys as well as that of men—all males. If we can start off with our youngsters appreciating the importance of regular check-ups, then they're going to be less likely to try to avoid GPs and more likely to get the tests that could save their lives. With young adult males, we know that we've got high levels of mental ill health and death from preventable causes such as accidents. Obviously, death by suicide is a major problem in our country, and we need to do more to battle it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government has produced a national men's health strategy for 2020 to 2030 that aims to build on the 2010 National Male Health Policy, and I think there is a lot of common ground between the government and the opposition in this space. I would certainly be keen, as I know the member for Perth would be, to work constructively with the government. I think there's a lot that we need to do, though, to implement the men's health strategy. Strategies are good, but it's the implementation and the resourcing of those strategies that's really important. We need to make sure that we've got the policies right, particularly in rural and regional areas of Australia, because we know that ill health is a big problem there. We also want to make sure that we consult, keep consulting and keep consulting more with relevant communities about their specific health needs, whether it be First Nations communities, gay and bisexual men and their communities, or culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Wherever there are communities where we can do things better and in a more appropriate way, we should absolutely be doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my message to the blokes of Australia is: go and get your prostate check done. As the member for Blaxland said, by encouraging men to do that, you will, without a doubt, save lives—and that's a really important thing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I join my colleagues in commending the member for Perth not only for raising awareness of this really important issue and bringing this motion forward but also for raising awareness about the fine work of Mr David Dyke and encouraging others to watch this documentary. As previous members have mentioned, prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Australia and more men die of prostate cancer than do women of breast cancer. There has been a very concerted effort to raise awareness of breast cancer and the early detection of breast cancer. The majority of men with low-grade prostate cancer can live for many years without symptoms and without it spreading and becoming life threatening, which underscores the importance of raising awareness and encouraging men to get their PSA tested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many families around Australia, my family is not immune to prostate cancer. My dear father-in-law, Alfie Allen, died of prostate cancer in 2012. He never got to attend our wedding, but we are thankful for the small blessings, like the fact that he got to hold his great-grandson about a week before he passed away. Not a day goes by that we don't think about Alfie and that we don't remember him in a fond way, but his death really had a big impact on the family. He lived with prostate cancer for about a decade and a half. His brother, Ronnie Allen, has recently also been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent radiation and, thankfully, he's doing okay. But, like many families, we know that if you have a first degree male relative with prostate cancer you have a higher chance of developing it than men with no such history, and the risk increases again if more than one male relative has prostate cancer. Prostate cancer in my family in particular—in the case of my husband, David, both his father and his uncle have been diagnosed with prostate cancer—is something that we're very aware of, and so my husband has regular check-ups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I saw that the member for Perth had put this motion I took the opportunity here today not just to share the personal story but also to share with people out there just how important it is to have regular check-ups in the same way that women have regular check-ups for breast cancer. We go do our mammograms and we do our self-check-ups. Sometimes I think blokes are a little more hesitant to look after their health. Sometimes I think it's important for us women to give them a little bit more of a push to look after their health and to make sure that they are getting their PSA test and that they are going for regular check-ups. I know that my colleagues who have spoken here today have all spoken about their own reasons for raising awareness of prostate cancer. For me, I guess, as the wife of a man who has a high risk of prostate cancer because prostate cancer runs in the family, I'd like to put out a message to all the women out there to raise awareness among them of the need to encourage their male partners to have their prostate tests regularly as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If one does happen to get prostate cancer there are some great initiatives and support services in the community. These include groups and events run by the Cancer Council or the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and more visible initiatives such as Movember. My husband won't grow a moustache but he's quite welcome to grow a goatee during Movember in recognition and raising awareness of prostate cancer. Once again I commend the member for Perth for raising this really important issue and also those members who spoke before me about raising awareness of prostate cancer. I encourage everyone to continue to speak up about just how important it is to get those tests done and to look after men's health.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  In my community, the winter seasons of the local sporting codes are in full swing, and it has been such fun to attend so many games rain, hail or shine. However, many of our sporting facilities are falling behind modern standards for disability access and gender inclusiveness despite our volunteer committees. I will say that many of our facilities have been upgraded over the last three years, and it has been a privilege to work with those committees to get those upgrades over the line. However, there is always more to do. What we find is that many of our facilities were built in the fifties and had some renos in the seventies, and now they're in a desperate state of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all the clubs whose have approached my office in upgrading their facilities. I will give a bit of a shout-out to Clarendon Netball Club, who I visited just last Saturday. They have two sheds that are in desperate need. They have been flooded and are no place for an umpire to change. Honestly, if you saw them, they're worse than any garden shed of a suburban home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a tough job for volunteers to turn a vision into a viable project. I recognise that, and so I will continue to hold grant-writing workshops so we can build our capacity. To all the clubs in Mayo: I want you to know I will continue to advocate for you and for our projects and support you in your grant applications. I'm very keen to continue talking with government on every single one of our projects.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I rise to inform the House of my recent visit to a school holiday chess competition in my constituency of Bennelong. At this event, students from local schools had the opportunity to play against a New South Wales chess champion and had a great deal of fun along the way. In playing chess, students are able to improve their concentration, decision-making and problem-solving skills. These skills are relevant to many aspects of life and, I'm sure, will hold the students in good stead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the specifics accrue not just to students but to adults as well. I urge members of the House to check in with their colleagues and see if any of them would be willing to be challenged by this great game. The benefits of chess are already well known to the members of Bennelong's Armenian community. In Armenia, chess has a strong culture. Chess is taught in schools and is a vital part of their social life. I am thankful that they have encouraged this in our community in Bennelong. I look forward to learning more about chess, experiencing more chess in the future and promoting it amongst our school students.</span>

We had a wonderful NAIDOC Week with loads of great events but also the Greek GleNTi, with wonderful lamb. There was so much good food. Opa! There were also the Territory Taste Festival and the V8 Supercars for those who appreciate motor sports, and our Darwin cup carnival is well and truly underway. I must inform the chamber here that I had a win on Saturday on a horse that I chose because its name was Clever Tommy, and my little brother Tommy, who I think is quite clever, was the beneficiary of the win there. When I get back, the Darwin Show will be on, and it's always a magnificent couple of days. The week after that, the Nepali community will be having their food and cultural festival at the waterfront, which is always a great event with loads of great entertainment. The Top End at this time of year just comes alive with so many festivals. The community are really getting involved, and I encourage all members to come up and get involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Last weekend it was finally time to come face-to-face with Pill Testing Australia to bring some science to the debate that has been raging in the media about pill testing at music festivals. The reality from the tragic coronial inquest in New South Wales is that all of the festivalgoers who died had large amounts of pure MDMA in their bodies, found through toxicology, together with other drugs including alcohol and weed. These concerns shadow the importance of contaminants within pills, which is what we thought the focus of testing was all about. But, after two days of discussion, it is clear that Pill Testing Australia continues with the fallacy that they can tell the dose when they test a pill for a festivalgoer. After all, it is the dose that kills, not the contaminants; we are finding that pure MDMA is putting young Australians in body bags.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Pill Testing Australia to continue to deceptively make out to the mainstream media that they are testing the dose—when they are not—is grossly misleading. Pill Testing Australia is using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. They are now crowdfunding an attempt to use gas chromatography. None of these tools will measure the dose. Unless you have a pure sample of MDMA, which I suspect they don't, unless you test and retest over hours, which we know they don't, and unless you take that entire pill and destroy it in a solvent to test the entire pill, you cannot measure the dose. We know that Pill Testing Australia doesn't do that. I call on them to come clean.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Did you know that strokes can occur at any age, even in children? I found this out recently after meeting an inspiring young local resident in my electorate, 11-year-old Elliott Clayton, whose sister Sophie suffered a stroke nine years ago when she was just four years old. Stroke is one of Australia's biggest killers and a leading cause of disability. As Elliott has become older, it has become his 'passion project' to make more young people and children aware of stroke, including what they can do to save lives. I have pledged to work alongside Elliott on this passion project to ensure more young people and children are aware of the signs of stroke and know what to do. The Stroke Foundation recommends the FAST test as an easy way to remember the most common signs of stroke: Check their face. Has their mouth dropped? Check their arms. Can they lift both arms? Check their speech. Is their speech slurred? Do they understand you? And time is critical. If you see any of these signs, call 000 straightaway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three simple ways residents, schools and businesses can help Elliott and help the community become stroke aware: (1) register to become a FAST hero this September—Stroke Week is from 2 to 8 September; (2) put up a 'Think FAST' stroke poster in your classroom or business; or (3) host a stroke ambassador for a stroke safe talk. By working together we can all be more stroke aware and help save lives. I commend Elliott and his wonderful passion project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  The Hawthorn Football Club has made an incredibly positive contribution to the northern Tasmanian community since it first began playing AFL roster and pre-season games back in 2001. Their new partnership with the University of Tasmania will see the two institutions work together to lift educational attainment, develop distinctive new study and research opportunities, and improve health and wellbeing in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note today the historic memorandum of understanding which the club recently signed with the University of Tasmania. One of the first actions from the MOU will see Hawthorn Football Club's health and wellbeing online platform become a learning destination for the award-winning Children's University. Children's University in Tasmania is administered by the University of Tasmania and currently services over 45 schools and more than 1,000 areas across the state, with a focus on schools in lower socio-economic areas. The partnership between Hawthorn and the University of Tasmania is yet another wonderful learning opportunity for the children involved in this program. I take this opportunity to thank Hawthorn Football Club CEO Justin Reeves and University of Tasmania Provost Professor Jane Long for their initiative and drive in creating opportunities for a better northern Tasmanian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  After six years of waiting, Mount Tomah will no longer be in line for a new mobile phone tower after the New South Wales and federal governments apparently gave approval for the project to be moved to somewhere near Dubbo. This is a project that was announced in the first rounds of mobile black spot funding. It's a slap in the face to the residents of Macquarie. It just got put in the too-hard basket. This is in spite of me working with the minister's office and Telstra to identify three alternative locations and ensuring they were talking to Blue Mountains City Council. But it turns out that the decision to move the tower had already been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mount Tomah is a highly bushfire-prone area along the busy Bells Line of Road and a long way from services. People who live in Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine were also hoping to gain some benefit from the additional coverage. This area should absolutely be a priority for improved mobile reception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there are also significant problems with the rollout of the Yellow Rock tower, with serious concerns that that project won't proceed. Let me remind you: Yellow Rock was badly hit by the 2013 Blue Mountains bushfire. With NBN coming, there'll be no landlines and mobile will be the only emergency communication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was of the belief that this program was above politics. How wrong I was! These towers must be reinstated and guaranteed to be constructed in the current term of this government, not some way off in la-la land.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  On Saturday night this past weekend the Toowoomba community gathered together to support a significant fundraiser for LifeFlight, the essential RACQ aeromedical service that services the Toowoomba, Darling Downs and south-west Queensland regions. Over 500 people were in attendance at the fundraiser on Saturday night, filling the Empire Theatre. Toowoomba heard of LifeFlight's proud history and recent activities, and, more particularly, the need for funding going forward. In the last financial year Toowoomba crews flew 643 missions, making our helicopter base in Toowoomba the busiest in Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community spirit on Saturday night was clear. We raised more than $330,000 at the one event to support the essential activities of LifeFlight. It's been a great honour of mine to represent the federal government in supporting LifeFlight and the new helicopter base in Toowoomba, and, most particularly, supporting local philanthropist and legend Clive Berghofer AM OAM, who has yet again put his own money up—some millions of dollars—to support the activities of LifeFlight and so many activities across other organisations supporting our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise to register my disgust at the New South Wales government's recent approval, through the state planning authority, of the Scenic Hills cemetery. With the Catholic Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust, the state government has acted to destroy infrastructure that was given to the people of Macarthur over a generation ago. The Scenic Hills—a green space, a buffer between Sydney and the Macarthur area—was always planned to stay as farming land, as green space, as that buffer. The state government, by completely removing the local council's powers to plan and by giving the planning authority to the state planning authority, has colluded with the Catholic Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust and other stakeholders, none of whom live in the area, to destroy this vital piece of Macarthur infrastructure. There will no longer be that green vista, that gave us our lungs, for the residents of Macarthur. It's a disgraceful act—an act of collusion by a state government that takes its orders from property developers and the big end of town. None of these stakeholders actually live in the area, and none of these stakeholders understand the importance of that green vista. It was a terrible act—an act of vandalism and environmental destruction. I condemn the New South Wales state government for this cowardly and disastrous act.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  This is a story that Charles Wooley, from Nine's <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program, didn't tell viewers two weeks ago. The Whitsundays—a magical part of the world which lies in my electorate of Dawson—features many beautiful island and mainland resorts which have been renovated, rebuilt, reopened and are ready for business. Wooley claimed that only some, like Hamilton, have been rebuilt and reopened. This is far from the truth. Frankly, you'd expect better from a current affairs program which prides itself on its reporting. Just this month, InterContinental reopened the beautiful Hayman Island after a $135 million redevelopment. In April this year, Daydream Island officially reopened following a $120 million-plus redevelopment. Other island resorts open in the Whitsundays include Palm Bay Resort and Elysian Retreat, both on Long Island, and the Camp Island Lodge. And of course Hamilton Island was the first back to full operational status following Cyclone Debbie, and they have invested more than $500 million over 10 years to maintain that island paradise.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitsundays has been and always will be a fantastic destination for holiday-makers from both within Australia and overseas. The <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes </span>report was an undeserved kick in the guts that did nothing to help our region. Yes, there are island resorts that have not yet been rebuilt, but there are plenty that have been rebuilt and they are ready to welcome guests planning their next Whitsundays holiday. Maybe you, Madam Deputy Speaker, might consider it too.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Born in Agra and raised in Chandigarh, Deepak-Raj Gupta probably didn't imagine, when he moved to Melbourne as an international student in 1989, that one day he would be serving in the ACT Legislative Assembly. But, as a result of a number of tragedies and coincidences, he is about to join that august body. Deepak-Raj Gupta is somebody of great experience and enormous commitment. He is a former chairman of the Australia India Business Council and somebody who is active in the Canberra community, having been named ACT government Multicultural Advocate of the Year. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deepak-Raj Gupta's father died last year, and his mother passed away on 25 April this year. He said after he was chosen to go into the assembly, following the surprise resignation of Meegan Fitzharris: 'I wish my parents were here to share the joys of this news but surely they must be watching me from there.' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the hard work of Meegan Fitzharris and pay tribute to Jayson Hinder, a former chairman of Bendigo Bank, who would have taken the vacant seat had he not been tragically killed in a motorcycle accident in California in 2016. Deepak-Raj Gupta will serve the ACT people faithfully, and I congratulate him on his upcoming appointment.</span>

One of the benefits of sport is that it brings communities together and unites people of all backgrounds. In my community, sport is a great source of pride and honour. Today I wish to recognise the achievements of Eagleby Giants Junior Rugby League Football Club. I have the pleasure of regularly attending their games, and it was wonderful to see Eagleby Giants given a platform to share their unique story just last week, when Channel 10 news did their sports report live from the grounds.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a club which had humble beginnings in 2012. It was founded with the aim to develop a strong culture within sport that will assist players to become not only good footballers but also good people, which is why I believe the club's motto is very fitting and a good reminder to young people: 'Dream big and live large.' Sadly this year on the field, whilst the junior program is going gangbusters, the senior program have had one of those years they'd probably rather forget. But I'm pleased that the club has strong support and stewardship from two local legends—Mr Arthur Joyce, the club president, and Chappy Nick Carroll, the team captain. I wish them all the best. As Chappy Nick would say, onwards and upwards from here on out. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Yesterday I attended the third annual Vicki Cleary Day, at Piranha Park in my electorate. The Coburg Lions played North Melbourne in the VFL in a game honouring the life of Vicki Cleary. Thirty-two years ago Vicki was murdered in Coburg, outside her workplace, by her ex-boyfriend. In 1987 there was a defence of 'provocation', and that's exactly what Vicki's killer used. He was sentenced to just a minimum of six years jail. He served only four years—for murder. The injustice of this sentence has driven Phil Cleary, Vicki's brother and Coburg footy club champion and coach, to dedicate himself to the campaign against violence against women. Of course, Phil is a former member for Wills as well. He has fought hard on this campaign for many decades and has been particularly important in engaging men and young boys in the culture of football clubs, where it is most important that they understand respect for women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, things have improved since 1987, but we still have a long way to go to eradicate violence against women. On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner. It's a shocking statistic. So far this year, 28 women have been killed through violence, according to various grassroots advocacy groups. Such a register should not really exist, but perhaps a register like this can help remind us that we as a society have more work to do. That's why we'll be working together with Phil on the idea of a national toll, to actually highlight the shocking statistic and drive us in society to do better and work harder to eradicate violence against women.</span>

Sarz Sanctuary was set up in memory of 21-year-old Queenslander Sara Zelenak, who was murdered in the 2017 London Bridge and Borough Street Market terror attack. Sarz Sanctuary aims to be the first healing sanctuary in Australia to offer personalised support and treatment programs for people who are suffering with traumatic grief.</span>

I want to give a big shout-out to Rob Goodwin, a local legend, who helped coordinate the logistics on the ground from his home base in Cairns. Sarz Sanctuary has collected hundreds of kilos of clothing that the expedition plan to deliver and distribute through Papua New Guinean villages. Mark told reporters last week:</span>

This is the game of the year for the club and, like so many other patrons, I am very excited to see the Pies fly against the A-League team. A crowd of at least 3,000 are expected to attend the ground, but the number of people watching will be vastly larger as it's broadcast across Foxtel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maitland Magpies are a great local team, with young talented players like Zach Thomas, who has had an outstanding year; Jimmy Thompson; Tommy Duggan; and Nick Cowburn. Former Australian international and Newcastle Jets captain Matt Thompson is looking forward to the challenge, but no more than former Central Coast Mariner and current Maitland goalkeeper Matthew Trott. I encourage all the Maitland community to get down and support the Magpies. Parliament is sitting that week, so I won't be able to be there in person. But I'll be here watching on Foxtel and be there in spirit with you, guys. Congratulations to Maitland FC President Ray Watkins and coach Mick Bolch for getting the team prepared. You have done an outstanding job, and it is a big deal for Maitland and our area. For a club like the Maitland Magpies, the opportunity to host the Mariners is well earned. Good luck to the team. Get out there and give it your all—and, as we say, fly, Pies, fly!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Greg Mullens is an outstanding member of the Northern Beaches community and was recently awarded the Order Of Australia Medal for distinguished service to the community of New South Wales through leadership in firefighting, to the emergency response sector and to gender equity in recruitment. He retired as Fire and Rescue NSW Commissioner in 2017 after 39 years of service and is respected and admired by many. During this time Greg performed a number of duties ranging from helping with everyday tasks to major house fires. Such efforts led to Greg receiving the Australian Fire Services Medal, an award for distinguished service by a member of the Australian fire service. Greg's commitment to the fire service and to helping others has also seen him assist overseas. He travelled to New Zealand in 2011 alongside other Australian firefighters to help in Christchurch following the earthquake that claimed the lives of 185 people. He was also involved in supporting the Australian firefighters who assisted in the aftermath of the Boxing Day 2004 Indonesian tsunami. We in Mackellar are exceedingly proud to call Greg one of our own. He is an incredibly deserving recipient of the Order of Australia Medal.</span>

This Is My Brave is relatively new to Australia and has achieved success in the United States since it was kick-started in 2016. It aims to bring stories of mental health challenges out of the shadows and into the spotlight. This Is My Brave helps to break down stigma and stereotypes surrounding mental health challenges through storytelling, poetry, song, dance and creative expression, live on stage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Is My Brave Australia, Central Coast, will be a three-month journey, culminating in a live show during Mental Health Awareness Month in October. The journey started with the launch in June, and I want to particularly thank Greg Smith, founder of Men Care Too, for bringing TIMBA to the coast, with the support of the Iris Foundation, the Elderslee Foundation, and Behind the Seen, along with Ability Links and This is My Brave Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next stage of the project was a storytelling workshop held last Saturday in the Tuggerah Library, where people interested in sharing their story, people from a wide range of backgrounds and with their own unique journeys, joined together for an introduction to framing their stories in three to five minutes. Auditions will be held on 26 and 27 July, and then 12 to 14 storytellers will be chosen as the cast of the inaugural Central Coast show.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year, I was contacted by Srikant Rajan and Rebecca Hyland and asked to attend a residents group meeting in Cranbourne North to listen to their concerns. The residents of the Tulliallan estate in Cranbourne North had bought into this wonderful estate, having been told by a particular real estate group, RPM Real Estate Group, and the developers, Konann Pty Ltd, that the area that they had bought around would be a park—we hear this often—but were not told that they were going to have to fight tooth and nail to ensure that it stayed a park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to their great lobbying efforts, their commitment and their respectful approach, they have won. Recently, the City of Casey—and they are to be commended—have purchased that land so it can be held in perpetuity and turned into the parks and ovals that the Tulliallan residents group were told they would have when they bought into the property. So congratulations to the Tulliallan community action group. Congratulations to the City of Casey. People power does work. People's voices do matter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It was my pleasure on Saturday night to go with my wife and enjoy being part of the Rotary Club of Taree on Manning's annual Christmas in July celebration which is held in the Centrepoint Arcade in downtown Taree. It was great to see over 100 people attend and be part of a major fundraising event delivered totally by volunteers. The long tables, the meals, the bidding for all the raffles and so on and so forth raised over $8,000 for youth activities that Rotary run in the Manning Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate past district governor Maurie Stack and his wife, Deidre, who initiated the event some years ago. I would also like to congratulate the chair, Jane Mackenzie, and her husband, chef Neil Mackenzie, Dusty and Phil Walkom, and chef Julie-Ann Booth. We also enjoyed the music provided by local entertainer and performer Matt Zarb. Congratulations to the Rotary Club of Taree on Manning.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very pleased to attend Bundaleer nursing home in Wauchope 10 days ago and see the launch of the plan for a 140-bed facility newly built in Wauchope, courtesy of an $8.5 million grant from the federal coalition government. It will deliver a 140-bed facility specialising in caring for dementia, which is an increasing phenomenon across the aged demographic of the Lyne electorate. There will be 100 jobs in the construction and 100 new jobs at completion. Congratulations, Bundaleer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I hope you will forgive my sympathy scarf and sympathy for the people in Tasmania suffering cold, shocking weather today. I'm on my feet because Tasmanians love snow. We flock to it. This winter we've seen very cold weather come to Tasmania in a very short amount of time, blanketing pockets of my electorate in the south with snow. Unfortunately, existing infrastructure often prevents people taking full advantage of the snow. Our roads, in particular, are stopping people from being able to access Tasmania's best snowfields. On Kunanyi, the mountain towering over Hobart, every winter we see snow cause road closures. The existing network is unsafe and too old to allow safe passage. If only we had a cable car.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the Derwent Valley has similar problems. Road closures are making some of our best snowfields inaccessible, damaging winter economies and isolating communities. The closure of the Lake Dobson Road two weekends ago, for instance, meant the Mount Field National Park and its popular ski field were not accessible. When people want to use the facilities, they can't get there. Derwent Valley tourism group co-founder and operator of Tassie Bound Adventure Tours Fiona Weaver says road closures mean communities are missing out on opportunities. Those sentiments are echoed by Rachel Power, co-owner of Waterfalls Cafe in Mount Field. My plea to the state government is: open some roads.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  The redevelopment of Heathridge Park precinct in my electorate is an exciting priority project which requires funding from all three levels of government. The popular venue is used by thousands of local residents for sporting and community purposes. A number of local clubs utilise the grounds and ageing clubroom facilities, including the Ocean Ridge junior and amateur football clubs, the Ocean Ridge junior and senior cricket clubs and the Ocean Ridge Tennis Club. The current clubhouse buildings are more than 30 years old and inadequate to meet the needs of our growing population. Larger and more modern change rooms, toilets and clubroom and kitchen facilities are required in order to meet the needs of an increasing number of junior and female participants in sports such as women's AFL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jamie Shaxted, President of the Ocean Ridge Junior Football Club, recently arranged a site visit to show me firsthand the genuine need for upgraded sporting facilities for local families. The City of Joondalup is preparing a master plan for the redevelopment of Heathridge Park and, as the local government authority, will take the lead role in project management. I strongly make the case for a federal funding contribution in the next budget towards the redevelopment of Heathridge Park.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I wish to bring to the House's attention an issue which I have raised with the minister, and that is the pending closure of the Jenny's Place Domestic Violence Resource Centre in Newcastle. Without an injection of new money into this resource centre, it is set to close its doors by September. The Newcastle-Hunter region has one of the highest rates of domestic violence in the country, and the unmet need that already exists in that community is staggering. We simply cannot afford to lose a frontline service like Jenny's Place Domestic Violence Resource Centre. Importantly, it is a centre that works both in prevention and in providing support and assistance in times of crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government campaigned on a promise of $328 million to combat domestic violence in our community. That included $86 million to be sent to frontline services. I'm calling on the government today and urging the minister—I've already written to her about the subject and I will put to her a more detailed proposal—to save vital frontline services like Jenny's Place domestic violence resource centre. This is a test of the government's commitment to stopping violence against women and children.</span>

The school is in such bad condition that you or I would not live in it, yet these children are exposed to the black mould and the poor conditions every school day. There has been no action from the New South Wales Liberal government, no action from the Premier and no action from the education ministers, in spite of the fact that on numerous occasions I have written to them requesting they come to the school to see what condition it's in. </span>

When the school opened in 1989, it had only 86 students and six staff. It was planned to be a two-stream—meaning two classes per year—group school, probably going up to year 4. However, over the last 30 years the population has expanded nearly tenfold. The school now hosts 800 students and 60 members of staff and is a complete four-stream school going from kindergarten to year 6.</span>

The school community also includes families from many cultural backgrounds, with over 40 nationalities testament to the unifying power of education. I applaud John the Baptist primary school for the past 30 years of developing a superb learning environment for all their children and I look forward to everything that they can achieve in the next 30 years.</span>

One of the things that we really need in our electorate is a continued upgrade of Heathcote Road. Heathcote Road doesn't only service the suburbs from Heathcote and Engadine across to Wattle Grove and Hammondville; it is a major thoroughfare that services areas from the Illawarra all the way through to Western Sydney. It takes as much traffic as any major road in Sydney. However, the road itself is not divided; it is more what you would expect of a little-used country road.</span>

                  </a>  Correct. This year we have seen two separate incidents involving three fatalities on that road. One of the main things that we need to do is work with the state government of New South Wales to make sure we continue that upgrade of Heathcote Road. We've already seen some improvements. We've seen Deadmans Creek bridge re-aligned and widened. We've seen developments at other intersections. But we need that road divided all the way. It's 24 kilometres long. It must be one of the priorities of both the federal government and the New South Wales government. I'll continue to lobby for those upgrades to occur.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  It's with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the Mayfield United Junior Soccer Football Club. I had the pleasure of attending their 75th anniversary dinner last Saturday night. I'm the patron of the club, and what I especially love about this club is that it is about as grassroots as you can get in a soccer club. Their commitment to ensuring that they are an inclusive club—they reach out to families with children with special needs and they have an astonishing number of women coming up through their ranks—is a real credit to each and every person involved in the club.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a sporting club last 75 years is no mean feat in itself. These clubs are driven entirely by voluntary labour and contributions. They are forever fundraising and working with council to try to ensure that their grounds are up to scratch and they are providing for the needs of their communities. As I said, I've always been really delighted with the club. I've gone to see some games. They have a wildcat cup they play for each year. I went to see that. It was terrific to see girls as young as five running around and learning the joy of being part of a sporting team.</span>

These include increasing the number of car parking places at Eltham railway station; improving the drop-off and pick-up points at about 15 or 16 different school and preschool locations in Nillumbik; and, importantly, improving the flow from Main Road onto Fitzsimons Lane, one of the most congested parts of the shire at the present time. I look forward to further meetings in which I can continue to liaise with the council to bring these projects to fruition for the benefit of the residents of Menzies and the shire of Nillumbik.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With just over 100,000 people making up the electorate of Bass, I'm pleased to state that over 40,400 people will benefit from the government's tax relief for 2018-19 and more than 16,300 will receive the full tax offset of $1,080. Those numbers are significant and important but at the heart of the numbers is people. I would like to talk about what this money means for the hardworking people of Bass and for their lives. Nick, who is a hotel employee in Launceston, will receive the full benefit. Marnie and Matt, nurses at the LGH, will both receive the full benefit of the cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a common fact that our winters in northern Tasmania, while very beautiful, can be very cold, sometimes hitting minus two or three. This tax break allows my constituents to have a bit more money to cover their winter heating bill or to pay the local mechanic to service their car or fit some new tyres. It's a bit more money in the pockets of mums and dads for some of those extra costs that come with raising a family. As a mum of five I can assure you that these extras can seem endless. It's new sneakers or clothes that they always seem to be growing out of, some learn-to-swim lessons at the local pool, membership at the local footy or netball club or some extra fuel to drive them to training. It is a few more dollars for the first home owner who has saved hard to purchase their home but would now like to buy some extra paint or some plants for their garden or purchase an item or two from their local homewares small business to complete the look of their home. It might also mean the opportunity to enjoy a weekend getaway at one of Tasmania's fantastic tourism destinations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is much-needed tax relief that is welcomed by individuals and families in my electorate because it allows them to keep a little bit more of what they have worked so hard to earn and spend it in the local economy. Importantly it is also about the wider economy. It's about confidence. Time and time again during the election campaign I heard from people in Bass about the importance of confidence to their economic success. From builders and plumbers to retail outlets and tourism operators, every single small business person I spoke to talked about how responsive the economy of northern Tasmania is to confidence and, conversely, how quickly it can react to a lack of confidence. Many were holding their breath waiting on the outcome of the election before deciding on their future plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan for lower taxes that we took to the election was a critical part of delivering that confidence and it was backed by the people of northern Tasmania. Even in the last week I have spoken to constituents in northern Tasmania who now, because of the return to office of the Morrison Liberal government, have the confidence to move forward with development plans that will create more jobs and more opportunities for the people of Bass. We are seeing an incredible amount of development and investment in Launceston alone on the back of that confidence: multiple new hotel developments, inner city dwellings and the relocation of the University of Tasmania. I look forward to seeing that momentum continue in northern Tasmania, with more confidence, more jobs, more investment and more Tasmanians keeping more of what they have earned.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I'm glad to speak to the motion, which I guess is a kind of trumpet-blowing exercise. It's the first motion brought by the member for Bass; I offer my congratulations on her election. If it were me, I wouldn't be drawing attention to the fact that the government only has one piece of economic policy, and they've already bungled it. On this side, we have been clear in saying that tax cuts focused on lower-income households are very welcome. We went to the election with larger tax cuts for lower- and middle- income households. We supported the government's less generous and less timely tax cuts because at least they had a similar focus and because they deliver at least some broader economic benefit. But if it were me, I wouldn't be drawing attention to legislating the stage 3 tax cuts, which, on any reasonable analysis, are unnecessary, ineffective as an economic measure and reckless, considering they don't start for five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really shouldn't be the case that the economic debate in this place, or outside this place, gets so dumbed down that we can't get beyond a neolithic 'tax cuts are good' form of debate. What defines this country is the things we share. Our access to education and health care; our access to welfare support and aged care when we need it; our access to parks, libraries, roads and public transport; the protection we get from the Defence Force and our emergency services—all of these things we share irrespective of whether we happen to have a lot or not very much at all. What makes that possible? The taxes we contribute and the taxes that companies contribute. Let's recognise that any debate about tax or tax reform is not about less or more tax per se; it is about our shared social and economic wellbeing and how that is properly delivered and fairly paid for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With stage 3, what those opposite have bestowed on the Australian community is a revenue time bomb with a five-year fuse. They have decided that it's okay to punch a $90 billion hole in our capacity to pay for the things we all share and the things we all need, with no benefit in terms of stimulus, and at a time when the economy is weak and fragile. They have punched a hole in the capacity of government to respond to economic shocks and to deliver critical services, especially in areas like health and aged care. The assumptions in their budget are based on rapid growth in net migration yet they've said—and the Prime Minister has promised—that they are going to reduce permanent migration by 120,000 over the next four years. Their budget assumes that the proportion of working-age people in the population as a whole will stay the same, when all the indicators show that ratio peaked in 2009, is falling and will continue to fall. That means lower growth and less revenue. It means rising costs in health and aged care. But you don't have to take my word for it; that's what the Parliamentary Budget Office said at the time of the last budget:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the next decade, the ageing population is projected to subtract 0.4 percentage points from the annual real growth in revenue and add 0.3 percentage points to the annual real growth in spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In real dollar terms, this equates to an annual cost to the budget of around $36 billion by 2028–29. This is larger than the projected cost of Medicare in that same year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet those opposite have kissed goodbye to $90 billion over the next 10 years. They've all been sent through the internal mail the 'tax cuts are good' finger painting, and that's good enough for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say, in relation to the part of the motion that refers to the plan for lower taxes, that Australians should watch this space. They should watch very carefully because, if you read the ideological tea leaves, you will notice that the Liberal Party's regressive economic agenda goes beyond income tax cuts. They want to flatten out income tax because it suits their aggressive agenda, but this government is full of people who like the idea of increasing the GST. I reckon that is going to be part 2 of the equation. In other countries, we've seen the same old two-step: a regressive drop in income tax followed by a regressive jump in consumption tax. Who gets hurt? Low-income households. If people want to talk about class warfare, that is class warfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important thing to note in this debate, when we put the trumpet-blowing and back-patting aside, is the enormous gap between self-congratulation and achievement. This is a third-term government. They've doubled the debt, they've presided over weakening growth and record underemployment, they've done nothing about stagnant real wages, they've supported cuts to penalty rates. At the same time, they've given us rising electricity costs and rising carbon emissions, they've chopped the Public Service and cut the ABC, and they've landed us with an NBN that is more or less obsolete on delivery. That is the record of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, six years and counting.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  This motion is important because it speaks to the heart of what this government is about. It's not about empowering the people in this room. It's not about empowering the people who are in Canberra. It's actually about empowering people, individuals, families and communities, as the foundation for this great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a disappointment that the member for Fremantle is running out of the Federation Chamber, because there is nothing I would enjoy more than responding to his fine address—not least because he says that tax cuts are the only objective of this government. In fact, he criticised the outstanding member who moved this motion, and he suggested that it is the only substance of this government. Clearly the member for Fremantle did not sit through the Governor-General's address at the start of this parliament. It went for about 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, Member for Fremantle: I love tax reform so much I could talk about it for half an hour. But I concede that that was not the only substantial point. The government has an extensive program focused on infrastructure, supporting people with mental health issues and doing all sorts of things—meeting the expectations of Australians with record funding in health, in education and for the sorts of support services Australians want their government to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But why can this government deliver it? The reason is simple. The reason we can deliver it is that we're running a strong budget framework, a budget surplus, which they love to neglect. One of their members referred to it as a vanity project. That is the nature and the objective of this Labor Party, this opposition. They see prudent, responsible budget management as a vanity project of the nation rather than the core of what we should have as part of our budget framework so we can deliver for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should not underestimate the power and the capacity of what these tax cuts can do. As the mover of the motion rightly adds, it goes to the core of what this government is about: the opportunity for people to be successful. It means that more money will sit in people's pockets. It means they'll be empowered, because it's not just dollars and cents; it's power in people's lives to make choices in the best interests of themselves, their families and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the earlier speaker, the member for Fremantle, went on about how there's no stimulus, he must have missed the low- and middle-income tax offsets that were passed by this parliament, which, last I recall, he voted against. They only voted for it in the Senate, but they like to selectively forget that fact. You agree with it in principle, but, when it came down to it, which side of the chamber were you sitting on? We remember, and it wasn't the right side of chamber or the right side of history. What that money is going towards is stimulating the economy to make sure that people have more money in their pockets so they can support their local small businesses, support their communities and support growth, because we understand how critical this is to the success of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the one thing that has always plagued and plaqued the minds of our opponents: they see the success of the nation not through the success of Australians but through the success of themselves. That is one of the fundamental problems that sit at the heart of who they are and why the Australian people so resoundingly rejected them. While they stand here and now lecture us about how allegedly we're not bringing tax cuts along fast enough, they want the collective memory of the nation to forget the $387 billion of tax increases that they took to the election, which they said they thought was necessary for the success of the country and the foundation of the future success of Australians, to fund all the programs they would love to see—$387 billion. It is a scar on the legacy of an opposition that may once have felt that there was some sort of dignity in encouraging people and empowering individuals to live their lives. They were discarding the very legacy of the Hawke-Keating government that they so love to invoke when they seek to inspire their agenda. But they don't believe it. They talk it and they advocate it, but they don't live it. Their only agenda is to hit the hip pockets of Australians, because they think they know better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I was very surprised that the member for Bass, who moved this motion, was so enthusiastic about it that she couldn't even talk for the whole five minutes! Maybe that's because, in the first sentence, she admitted that 60 per cent of her electorate will not be getting these tax cuts. And why would that be? It is because so many Tasmanians earn less than $40,000 and will not be getting $1,000 in their tax returns. It is because many Tasmanians rely on government support payments. Her government's minister said the pension was generous. There are plenty of Tasmanian pensioners who don't think the pension is generous, because they are battling to keep a roof over their head in terms of the housing crisis that has been created by the state and federal Liberal governments in Tasmania today. There are also a lot of Newstart recipients in the Bass electorate who will not get a tax cut to help stimulate the Tasmanian economy. Interestingly, the member for Bass said she thinks her government should consider raising the rate of Newstart. Perhaps she can tell the Prime Minister that that is her view and add her name to the list of people on her side of the House who think people on Newstart should receive some sort of increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about these tax cuts is that a lot of low-income people who are earning a wage are not going to get $1,000. I have been talking to people in my electorate who have already submitted their tax returns, and I have found only one that got the full $1,000. This is because so many Tasmanians actually don't earn the national average income. Tasmanians are doing it tougher. We hear the member for Bass talk about how wonderful the Tasmanian economy is—and the Prime Minister says 'it's heading in the right direction'—but in the last 12 months Tasmania has lost 6,200 full-time jobs. That is a terrible thing. We have the highest unemployment in the country in Tasmania. I am saddened that the member for Bass, with her first private member's motion, can't talk for the full five minutes about the tax cuts that the government's introducing. She hasn't actually spoken about how Tasmanians are doing it tough, and she thinks these tax cuts are the only answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government went to the election with really no more policy than tax cuts. There are a few local election commitments from the Liberal Party, mostly in northern Tasmania, but too Tasmanians are doing it tough. Too many Tasmanians are going doing it tough in the housing crisis. Too many Tasmanians can't find a job. Too many Tasmanians can't enrol at TAFE or at the university because of state and federal Liberal governments. Too many Tasmanians are sitting in ambulances ramped at hospitals because of the underfunding of the health system by state and federal Liberal governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had to sit through the Minister for Health, in question time today, talking about how wonderful the federal Liberal government's investments in Tasmanian health are. They are not wonderful; they are clearly not working. If he wants to come down to Tasmania and tell Tasmanians that they are doing a great job on health, I don't think too many Tasmanians are going to believe it. The health system in Tasmania is in crisis. To have the member for Bass come in here, in her first motion, to talk about how great the government's tax cuts are I find really disappointing. And the people of Bass have a right to know that, in their member's first private member's motion, her biggest issue was to say: 'How great is the government! We've got some tax cuts.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Tasmanians would have been better off under Labor's fairer tax cuts, they would have been better off if the tax cuts were brought forward, and they would have been better off under the investments Labor would have made. That is the truth of it. The member for Bass can sit there and shake her head, but this is true. Labor offered a better plan for Tasmanians and we care more about Tasmanians than the current government does. The member for Bass comes in here and all she can talk about—for 3.5 minutes when she is supposed to deliver a five-minute speech—is how great the tax cuts are. She couldn't even talk for the whole five minutes. That is the member's first private member's contribution. I say to the member for Bass that she needs to get out of her office, get out of Canberra, and talk to the people in the street about how many Tasmanians are doing it tough. Far too many Tasmanians will miss out on theses tax cuts. She needs to be advocating for them in the federal parliament. She needs to be standing up and telling her government, 'We need to do more for those Tasmanians who are doing it tough on the pension, more for those Tasmanians who are living in housing crisis, more for those Tasmanians on Newstart and more for those Tasmanians who are working very hard but earn less than $40,000.' Too many Tasmanians are missing out today under this government.</span>

Places like the Sunshine Coast that rely so very heavily upon building and construction were facing an absolute economic Armageddon if that lot, Labor, won the election—$387 billion worth of extra taxes. Builders knew that it would have been their death knell, and they spoke in volumes. That's the difference between us and Labor. We took a policy to the last election that would see very significant tax cuts. They took a policy of increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now the Labor Party wants to rewrite history. In the previous sitting week—I had to check that I was hearing correctly—those opposite were trying to argue that our tax cuts weren't good enough whereas, during the election, they wanted to sting the Australian people with an additional $387 billion in taxes. I thought: 'No, no, no, this can't be right. What I'm hearing can't be right.' How could a party that was pushing $387 billion worth of additional taxes come in, in the first sitting week after the election, and say, 'You're not doing enough'? That, I believe, sums up the Labor Party. It sums up what they believe in. What they believe in will shift and chip and chop and change to whatever they think is going to get them good headlines and, perhaps one day, help them form government. They are without principle. They are without decent policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people spoke in volumes. Hardworking people from the building industry—in particular, anybody dressed in hi-vis—made it very clear to me in my three weeks on pre-poll that they would do anything other than vote for the Labor Party, because of the risk that it was to the national economy. Australians aren't mugs. They'll back a good government every day of the week, and that's what they did on 18 May.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  It's actually quite amusing to hear members from the Sunshine Coast refer to the Sunshine Coast as if it's the whole of Australia. Are we still surprised at all that the Sunshine Coast votes Liberal National Party? They have for a very long time. We're talking about some of the safest seats in the country. Let's just remind all of those in this place that the government only won by one seat—77 seats. That is not a massive mandate. They do not have a mandate in the Bendigo electorate on these tax cuts. They do not have a mandate in a lot of seats when it comes to the tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also just remind people about the broken promise. If you want to talk about headlines, there have been some headlines about these tax cuts that were pretty damning of the Prime Minister: 'Magician Scott Morrison's smoke and mirrors act on tax cuts'. He admits that he knew before the election he couldn't actually get them passed by 1 July. But let's just recall what he said before the election, after the budget, and during the election: that the $1,080 tax cuts could be paid administratively by the tax office even before the legislation had passed, an option the Morrison government later admitted wasn't possible. It is a broken promise. It's hard to believe that this government has got away with breaking a promise on these tax cuts. They told the Australian people in their election campaign it would be done before 1 July, yet they didn't recall parliament. It was practically impossible with how the writs were going to be issued, yet before the election the Prime Minister misled the Australian people on multiple occasions. The candidates misled the Australian people on multiple occasions. Their MPs misled the Australian people on multiple occasions. It couldn't be done. We offered to bring back parliament early so it could be done, but they denied it—broken promise No. 1.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the three stages of these tax cuts and who will really benefit. As the member for Franklin said, there are lots of people earning less than $40,000 who are shocked that they're not going to get the full benefit of $1,080. In my electorate, they did a little vox pop on WIN News and went around and asked, and all these young people said, 'Great.' They were looking forward to their $1000. Only after WIN said, 'How much do you earn a year?' and they responded, 'Oh, about $30,000 or $35,000,' did they hear, 'You're not going to get the full thousand dollars.' This government has misled people on who will benefit from this. There are lots of people, not just in Tasmania but all over regional Australia, who will not benefit the most from this package that has been passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where I get to stage 3. Stage 3 predominantly supports the very wealthy in this country. They are not people living in rural and regional Australia. In my own electorate of Bendigo, which is like a lot of regional electorates, average income is about $50,000. It is slightly higher than some of our other electorates, like Nicholls to the north. But in my electorate roughly 1.3 per cent of people earned over $180,000 in the tax year 2015-16. That is not a lot of people. About 1000 people will benefit from stage 3. Let's really take that in for a moment. Stage 3 of the tax plan that was passed will benefit really high-income earners who live in metro areas or are in some specific industries. It will not flow through to the rest of the taxpayers in our country. The smoke and mirrors campaign of this government and this Prime Minister continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the question is: how will they pay for stage 3? None of the government speakers spoke about what they're going to cut from the federal budget to pay for stage 3, which will cost the budget $95 billion by the end of the 2020s, or almost $20 billion a year. That's roughly twice what we spend on Newstart. Are we going to kick everyone off Newstart? Is that what the government's proposing? It's also twice what we spend on child care. Are the government proposing to slash all subsidies when it comes to child care? To this day they're boasting about stage 3 and what they're delivering, but what they haven't outlined is what they're going to cut from the budget to pay for it. Are they going to cut funding to aged care? Are they going to cut funding to the pension? To withdraw that amount of money from the budget, the government has to come clean on who they're going to cut, with less boasting and more honesty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I'd like to start by congratulating the member for Bass for her emphatic victory at the federal election—a 5.8 per cent swing in northern Tasmania. I think that beats just about everyone else. Of course, our friends in Queensland did such a wonderful job. But they did have the help of Bob Brown—they must admit that! Bob went to Queensland. He left Tasmania. Maybe he should have stayed in Tassie. But what a tremendous victory for the member for Bass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to congratulate her on her first motion. She understands the importance of tax cuts. It was a clear choice at the last election. The people of Bass had to decide on Labor's policy of $387 billion of initial taxes. They rejected it, and Labor lost that seat to the coalition in a landslide. Why? The simple reason, I'll argue, is that the Labor Party simply didn't understand that the policies of the coalition were merely allowing people to keep more of their own money. This is the great divide that we see in the House. We have seen in this debate that they've learnt nothing—three election losses in a row and they still have not learnt. Tax cuts are simply allowing people to keep more of their money that they own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that on the Labor side they don't see it as money that people own. They see it as their money. We saw that during the election campaign. We saw that with the retirees tax and the theft of franking credits that was planned by the Labor Party. Labor didn't understand that that money was earned by the company and earned by the shareholders of that company. They saw it as a gift. They went around insulting self-funded retirees, telling them that this was a gift from government. I remember Senator Keneally gave some speech and said, 'It's our money!' It's not their money. It belongs to the shareholders of those businesses that earned that money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the same thing with Labor's negative gearing policy. They simply didn't understand that negative gearing is not some great lurk. It is a simple principle that your interest is an expense of the income that you earn and should rightfully be deducted when you calculate your tax. And we saw it on their attack on family trusts, where they wanted distributions from those trusts to be taxed at 30 per cent—not understanding how many small family businesses work and the legitimate reason that their funds are set up in trusts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is the first step of this coalition government. It is to allow the citizens of this country to put more of the money that they earn into their pockets and to decide what they will spend it on. It's not just that. It's also creating the incentive for them to go out and earn more and create more wealth for this nation. When these tax cuts finally come through, 94 per cent of Australians will have a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent. That means when they want to work a bit of extra overtime, or if they are a small business that wants to expand or take a risk, they know that if they earn a few extra dollars they can keep 70 per cent of it for themselves. Yet we saw under Labor's policies that the taxman would take half of it. It's not only the stimulus effect of allowing people to have more of their money. The true stimulatory effect is the incentive it creates for people to get out there and work and earn more money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The public have spoken. They have rejected Labor's $387 billion of taxes. I would hope that, during this term of parliament, Labor could forget the idea that it is their money and understand that the taxes earned by the people of Australia firstly belongs to them. If they can understand that, maybe we may see the Labor Party be more competitive at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I congratulate the member for Bass on her emphatic victory and for bringing this important motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  It is now two weeks since both sides of this house voted for the tax changes referred to in this motion. To the extent that the tax cuts will benefit low- and middle-income earners, they have always been enthusiastically supported by Labor. It was a Labor government that enacted the last round of tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners back in 2013. By contrast, the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have lived off the proceeds of fiscal drag and bracket creep for the last six years. And it was not that long ago that the then Treasurer, the member for Cook, was proposing to raise the Medicare levy on all Australians taxpayers, rich and poor. That idea only died when Labor refused to support the higher levy being extended to persons on incomes less than $87,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass also seems to have forgotten that Labor went to the 2019 election supporting larger income tax relief for low- and middle-income earners than the coalition. The member suggests that lowering the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent represents structural reform to the taxation scales. Of itself, of course, it doesn't. The structural changes, whether you regard them as welcome or unwelcome, incentivising or merely regressive, lie elsewhere in the tax package. The post 1 July 2024 changes to the tax scales impose a major and possibly unsustainable stricture on the federal budget. They reduce the tax burden on better-off Australians but they don't eliminate bracket creep or fiscal drag for those earning around average weekly earnings or below. To secure the latter, you need to automatically index all and not just some of the income tax scales. Any effect on employment, business activity and economic confidence of the third round of cuts is absolutely problematic and what the Prime Minister might call 'an act of faith'. To suggest that some of those cuts might have been retargeted or brought forward is unremarkable, nor does it call into question the election outcome or defy the will of the people. It's merely prudent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perceptions of the economy have changed rapidly since the election. Economic challenges, both short and longer term, are clearly mounting. On the government's estimates, expenditure on aged care, medical services and benefits and income support for seniors has been growing in excess of anticipated revenues from taxation—and that's just to provide levels of service that most regard as barely adequate, particularly in our health system with lengthening waiting lists and longer wait times in emergency departments around the country. The government say that those future demands on the budget won't be prejudiced by their post 2024 tax changes. That is their call—and a big gamble. Only time will tell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Otherwise, the member for Bass's motion is not much more than a modest exercise in triumphalism, and I can see why. It was a significant election win against what was the prevailing view and was certainly against the polls. But I would like to see a little bit more humility and a little bit less strutting from many on the other side. The motion implies that the government was returned to office on a wave of enthusiasm for tax cuts that don't come into effect for another five years. Really? Is that not drawing the longest of long bows? Well over half the electorate voted for parties and candidates who did not support or fully endorse this government's taxation plan. If you believe the polling—and I say this with some hesitancy—the majority of Australians still generally prefer better government services to tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what of the government's mandate? 'Convincing' would not be the first world that could come to my mind in describing the coalition's election win. It is only one or two unfavourable by-elections or defections away from minority government. The government commands a bare majority in this place and it is in minority in the Senate. It secured only four out of 10 primary votes cast. The May 2019 election result makes it three out of four marginal wins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a populist age, public trust might be likened to a door hanging from a single hinge, and I suspect that is what this government is doing. The people's confidence, more than ever, has to be earned and has to be retained issue by issue. Long gone are the days when electoral promissory notes were written with a three-year term or open expiry date. We don't have the tradition of the UK, and it's arguable that our constitutional architecture, with a strong, elected upper house, is unsuited to a gentleman's agreement of, 'Let's just go along with the flow the government wants.' John Howard reportedly described the mandate theory of election victories as an absolute phoney— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamentals of our economy are strong thanks to the management of the Morrison government. At the 2019 election, the Australian people made it clear they wanted to back our plan to deliver economic prosperity for Australia's future. As part of our economic plan, we promised the Australian people tax cuts, and on 4 July we delivered on this promise. This tax package not only ensures immediate tax relief for 10 million low- and middle-income earners who are now receiving up to $1,080 for the 2018-19 financial year; it also delivers confidence to 94 per cent of Australians that they'll only be taxed at 30 cents in the dollar from 2024-25. Our government is not only concerned with the present but with the confidence that Australians can have so they can plan for the future. This tax relief will improve the tax system and reward hardworking Australians. In Berowra, 70,492 taxpayers will benefit from tax relief this year, with 24,694 receiving the full tax offset of $1,080.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, those opposite had a plan for $387 billion of taxes on the Australian economy. Taxes on retirees, taxes on housing, taxes on super, taxes on small business, taxes on energy—Labor's never seen a tax hike they didn't like. Australians listened closely to the Labor Party and, in particular, the member for McMahon, who said, 'If you don't like Labor's tax policy, don't vote for it.' Indeed, Australians voted against Labor in near record numbers, with Labor's primary vote dropping to its lowest level since the Great Depression. Labor continues to support higher taxes. It failed to support the government's tax cuts properly. Despite the Leader of the Opposition's listening tour, Labor remains deaf to the needs of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government for its ongoing plan to grow the economy and create jobs. The economy is not just about numbers on spreadsheets; it's about the lives of the people we are here to represent. One of the indicators of good economic management is a low unemployment rate. Unemployment is at the lowest level in almost seven years, at 5.2 per cent—in Berowra, it's as low as 3.7 per cent—and 1.4 million new jobs have been created since we were first elected to government in 2013. We are committed to creating an additional 1.25 million jobs over the next five years, with 40,000 new jobs created just last month. Under our government, the level of welfare dependency is at its lowest level in 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ways we're keeping unemployment low is by backing small business. Small business is absolutely key to creating jobs in our communities. In the Berowra electorate, we have over 15,000 small businesses that provide thousands of jobs to people in our community. From budget night, the instant asset write-off was increased and expanded from $25,000 to $30,000. The instant asset write-off was also expanded to businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. This will cover an extra 22,000 businesses across Australia, employing 1.7 million Australians. Already more than 350,000 businesses—businesses like CoHo or Harvest Coffee in my electorate—have taken up the instant asset write-off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continues to deliver on its record $100 billion infrastructure plan. Families in Berowra are benefitting directly from this investment. If we want a strong economy, we must ensure Australians are spending less time stuck in traffic and less time waiting for public transport. In my community, some key initiatives will give people back more productivity in their day. More time for work and more time for family is more fulfilling than more time for traffic. New Line Road is a massive headache for families in our area, and on budget night the government announced that $10 billion is being invested for the thorough planning of New Line Road to get it shovel-ready for state government investment. It's because of our strong economic management that our government is the first to inject government funds into New Line Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NorthConnex is one of the biggest infrastructure projects currently undertaken in New South Wales. Pennant Hills Road, as you know, Deputy Speaker, is one of the worst roads in Australia. The road carries around 80,000 vehicles per day, including more than 10,000 trucks. This project will deliver twin nine-kilometre tunnels that will enable motorists to drive from Newcastle to Melbourne without a single set of traffic lights. This project will take 5,000 trucks off Pennant Hills Road every single day. It will return the road to our community, improving transport times, reducing commuter travel and improving the overall safety of our roads. This project has also created 8,700 jobs and is a $412 million investment from the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's good economic plans have enabled us to lock in funding for hospitals and schools. There is $1 billion in federal government funding going into Berowra's schools—government, Catholic and independent—over the next decade. The good fiscal policy doesn't stop there. We're delivering budget surpluses. We're back in the black and back on track, as the Treasurer likes to say. I'm proud to be part of a government delivering for our country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  This week around 1,088 people woke up in the Illawarra, where I come from, without a home. They're no closer to getting a home this week than they were last week. They're homeless, and they're part of the hundreds of thousands of people in the same situation right around the country who are suffering. Not only are they locked out of the homebuyer market; they are locked out of the home rental market. In fact, if they picked up the newspaper on the weekend and looked for a place to rent, and that person was on income support, there would not have been one house available for them to rent. There is no hope now and no hope in the near future of any relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 9,692 people in the Illawarra who are looking for a job. Over 80 per cent of those are long-term unemployed. They currently receive around $278 a week. I dare anybody in this place to say that they could survive on $278 a week. You couldn't pay your rent, let alone your electricity bills, let alone put food on the table on $278 a week. So, whilst the member for Berowra, who I think is an honourable person, comes to this place with a motion talking about how wonderful the economic management of this government is and how strong the fundamentals of the economy are, if you're one of those 9,692 people looking for a job, you're not seeing any of the strength. If you're one of those 1,088 people who are sleeping rough tonight, you're not seeing a lot of joy in the local economy or the national figures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted with interest that the member's motion celebrated the fact that they're planning on creating 1.25 million more jobs over the next five years. It's unfortunate that when these motions are put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> it's often several weeks before they are debated, because a couple of days ago we received the latest figures on job creation. Deputy Speaker, you will have picked up, as I did, that over the last month a paltry 500 new jobs were created. So, if the last month is typical, it is going to take 208 years for the government to reach their 1.25 million jobs target, which many are suggesting is a low-ball target anyway. So, far from the economy being strong, it is in a very parlous state indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just Labor who is saying this; it is analysts. In fact, look at what the Reserve Bank is doing. Interest rates are at one per cent, with a further interest rate cut factored in by the market. Interest rates are at record lows. In fact, they are lower now than they were in the global financial crisis, when representatives from the coalition were saying they were at crisis rates. So, far from the economy being strong, it's very weak, and this government has no plans to do anything about it.</span>

                  </a>  I congratulate the member for Berowra on putting forward such a motion. Of course, the coalition government is absolutely committed to delivering what it said it would deliver during the last election campaign. That includes our $100 billion infrastructure plan over the next 10 years. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker McVeigh, being a regional member, this infrastructure plan is critical for our connective infrastructure, for growth, particularly in the regions, and for ensuring increases in productivity. And, of course, those increases in productivity make us much more competitive when we look at world trade.</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, not only will our $100 billion investment in infrastructure help drive regional productivity; it will allow our producers to be more competitive, particularly in terms of trade deals and arrangements overseas. What we in this place all know is that trade means jobs for Australia, and more trade means more jobs. We have already been successful in terms of those trade arrangements through agreements with China, South Korea and other countries. That has helped lift productivity and jobs in regional areas—in particular, in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is now worth over $60 billion, and the coalition government has a plan to drive that to $100 billion in the future. But that can't be done without the correct infrastructure—in particular, water and transport infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of what we talk about in this place at a national level, all stories are local. For the people of my electorate of Hinkler, where we have any number of challenges, we are driving commercial operations to be more successful, to have better operations and to have more jobs to help drive our regional economy. We are doing that with record infrastructure investments. The Hinkler regional deal, which was announced last year, is a commitment of $173 million from the federal government across a range of projects—from connecting roads and infrastructure, to port studies and all the way through to a multi-purpose conveyor at the Bundaberg port, which will be constructed with a 100 per cent grant from the federal government. But that assumes that the Queensland Labor government will decide to get on board. They have been dragging their heels to date. They continue to refuse to sign documents—</span>

                  </a>  We hear interjections from those opposite about dams. We have had billions of dollars on the table for dams and, quite simply, the Queensland Labor government have not picked them up—not a single one. In fact, their current proposal is to reduce the capacity of the Paradise Dam, not repair it. They want to drop the dam level by 10 metres or 15 metres. That will result in a reliability level of 60 per cent for irrigators. That does not help us with our trade and export plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have opportunities here, but we know that the true Premier of Queensland, Jackie Trad, is not on board. We need her to step up and help the people of regional communities. We cannot continue to sit around and have the federal government commit such large amounts of money and the state refuse to build them. We need them to get on board. We need them to build the roads. We need them to accept the money to build that connective infrastructure, particularly in our port. They continue to play games. They play games with the people of my electorate. These are individuals who are desperate for work. And yet we find that Queensland Labor, once again, are getting in the way of progress. They have no interest in our people—none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone on the opposite side knows the Constitution and what it sets aside for individual states and their responsibilities. We cannot make them build a road, but we need them to do it. We have put up our contribution—80 per cent for those connecting roads. In fact, we have a safety intersection on the Bruce Highway at Buxton. We have put forward $10 million. This is a substantial infrastructure investment, but the state refuses to play ball. We cannot continue to argue with ourselves when we are funding so much important infrastructure to drive jobs, to drive regional economies, and have the Queensland Labor government continue to get in the way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  What an absolute farce this motion is! Who, other than this government, thinks our economy is going well? Which economist can they point to who would actually agree with this motion? This government has cherrypicked these statistics as though they have something to brag about. The RBA said in its minutes released last week that GDP growth had been well below trend over the year to the March quarter. They also said growth in both household disposable income and wages had remained low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that the economy is weakening, because they feel it. They live it every day. They are worried about their job security and worried about making ends meet and putting food on the table. They actually experience the reality that a steady, decent income sufficient to pay a mortgage and raise a family is increasingly hard to achieve. They know what every well-paid economist knows: we have a floundering economy that cannot withstand another six years of inaction by this Liberal government. Where is this economic management and strong economy that the member for Berowra speaks of? I don't see it in the economic growth figures, which show that our economy is growing at its slowest rate since the GFC. I don't see it in the cost of living, which continues to rise above what families in this country can afford. I certainly don't see it in the wage stagnation that working families are experiencing around Australia across all industries. This government cannot manage the economy and can't be trusted to deliver the services that Australians rely on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth unemployment rate in this country is 12 per cent—double the national average. Ask a 22-year-old who hasn't been able to find a job since leaving high school how the economy's going for him or her. Ask his or her parents who are in insecure work, who can't plan financially because they don't know what shifts they'll get next week, let alone whether they'll have work the next day, and who can't afford to pay their bills because wages haven't risen in years. Is this a strong economy? Is this the best that working Australians can ask for? Is this truly the economy that the Prime Minister and the coalition promised they would deliver during the election? These are not the indicators of a strong economy. This is blatant economic mismanagement by a government that is failing the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government flaunt their record on job creation. The unemployment rate in this country is 5.2 per cent. The RBA says that it should be around 4.5 per cent, and some studies show it should be even lower. What does this government say to that? 'Job done; well done; move on'. Well, I disagree. Our economy can and should be employing more people. Our growth figures show quite plainly that consumption is a real issue in this country, that people cannot and are not spending their money outside of buying the bare essentials. To boost consumption and our economy, we should be employing more Australians. The RBA have said that if we continue to reduce unemployment and underemployment we will likely see an increase in wages and an increase in household incomes. Reducing unemployment should be a key target for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government boasts about the unemployment rate, what it is saying to young people in rural and regional Australia, where youth unemployment rate sit around the 15-20 per cent mark, is that the government has no role in job creation for them. Again, I couldn't disagree more. We are experiencing skills shortages in Australia and are forecast to continue to experience skill shortages into the future. This is in part due to Australia's high youth unemployment rate, leaving them unable to gain experience or receive training as part of work. As our population continues to age and skilled workers retire, the inability to receive training early in one's working life continues to impact on the individual. This results in constrained incomes for the remainder of their working life as well as impacting on the economy in the form of skills shortages. We must recognise that we need to invest in employing more Australians, particularly young people. I believe they deserve to be able to find employment, to be able to work in a decent, fairly-paid job and to gain the experience and dignity that work brings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need change. We can't continue to accept unemployment figures as they are. The RBA has been clear about that. We need a government that takes decisive action and that makes decent policy to address unemployment to get Australians into decent jobs. I urge the government to take a good, hard look at themselves and to act with decency. You may be fooling yourselves into believing the economy is strong but you certainly aren't fooling the Australian public.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I'd like to congratulate the member for Berowra, my good friend, and the author of 'Leeser economics: the wisdom and insight around strength and growth and opportunity'. I need to make it clear that I am not taking ownership of that title. That is of course up to the member of Dawson, but he has inspired me. More critically, this motion speaks to the government's ambition and exactly what this government wants to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout earlier debates today, we have heard other members, particularly the member for Fremantle, rant and rave about the narrowness of the government's agenda—only focused on tax. Don't get me wrong: tax is part of the government's agenda. But we see in this motion, in particular, a substantive component of every part of the full suite of the government's agenda in focusing on investment in infrastructure to build Australia's future; knowing we can pursue the opportunities of greater free trade with our neighbours and across the world; and the opportunity to build on the earlier success of a million new jobs over the previous five years to 1.25 million for the next five years. And of course there is that critical test, which the opposition has never met, of a budget surplus, one where the economy grows strongly but we also maintain prudent management of our books so that we can pay down the legacy of their debt and deficit and the fixed expenditure that they legislated without any care or concern for future generations—a discarding of concern for Australians and their future. And of course we're doing this all. And it must bite so hard that we were able, at the end of the last government, to have delivered—but also that we will be able to continue to deliver, at the end of this one—record funding for schools and hospitals. They talk it; we deliver it—that is the critical difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had the member for Cooper up here, waxing lyrical about her various concerns and saying, 'Where are these economists that are saying the Australian economy is growing strongly?'—which is filled very easily with answers like that from the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr Philip Lowe. We also have people like Chris Richardson, from Access Economics, saying the same thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't misunderstand: economies go through challenging times; economies face external threats; they do. It would be nice to be in a position where we could pull more fiscal stimulus levers, but I recall that they were all blown in one hit by the previous Labor government. We have other levers we can pull: monetary policy and interest rates. And we have the opportunities of structural reform. There are plenty of measures that we can take. But we need to be adaptive and responsive and understand the critical challenges that we face. Yes, we do need to be agile and innovative, but the benefits of being agile and innovative can only be secured if you run a strong budget position. And the legacy of the member for Oxley and his colleagues on the other side of this chamber is that they have shown scant regard or concern for doing so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is the benefit to Australians from this record investment? Most members will be able to say quite clearly what they think the benefits are in their electorates. So why don't we talk about some of the benefits in the wonderful Goldstein electorate, where, by delivering $100 million of infrastructure investment, we were able to do things like upgrade parking at local stations like Hampton, Brighton Beach, Sandringham and Elsternwick, to ease people's daily commutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't have a massive expectation of what government can achieve, because they know that, ultimately, the people most responsible for the success in their lives are themselves. But where there are unnecessary bugbears, and government can come in to remove problems and challenges from their lives—particularly from things as simple as their daily commute—they hope government will do that, and that, when local representatives stand up and speak on behalf of their communities, they will hear and act. And that's what we've done. That's what we were able to deliver. That's what we were able to secure.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  'Dreams'! Talk about nightmares—that's what we just heard in that contribution from the member for Goldstein, who, unfortunately, as we know, with my colleague the member for Berowra, is languishing on the backbench, not promoted. While all those other people are rushing up to the front of the table, they're languishing behind. As a consolation prize, they were given the notes by the Treasurer, saying: 'Come on. We're feeling the pressure. In you go. Read out what we've prepared for you.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this is a new parliament, but it's the same old government dragging the economy down. We might have new slogans, new excuses and new faces on that side of the chamber, but what we've heard today is this parallel universe, this alternative universe—that somehow we are supposed to believe that the government should be congratulated for a supposedly strong economy. The numbers tell a completely different story. And it's not just the numbers; it's the businesses and the residents in my community and hundreds of communities right around Australia who are feeling the pinch of a struggling economy, thanks to this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion even goes so far as to say the government should be thanked for the economic management and its plan to grow the economy. Let's look at the facts. The Australian economy has slowed to its weakest level since the tail end of the global financial crisis. Growth is just 0.4 per cent for the March quarter and 1.8 per cent for the year. Australia is still in a GDP per capita recession, with the measure having fallen for the last three quarters. For the first time since the 1982 recession, the national economy has gone from being the eighth fastest growing economy in the OECD in 2013 to the 20th now. Wages are growing at eight times slower than profits. Productivity has fallen for four consecutive quarters. Household spending is weak, and living standards are growing slower under the Liberals than under the previous Labor government. These are not the signs of a strong economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the leading business surveys. The NAB declared that the retail sector was 'clearly in recession'. Senior analyst Tom Youl said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Households will see little benefit over the next 12 months as both wages and household consumption are expected to experience modest gains. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The recently approved income tax as well as lower interest rates will offer some relief to incomes but financial policies are unlikely to provide meaningful economic growth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must offer a well-thought-out and constructed plan to turn around one of the weakest economies this generation has ever encountered. We know what the economy looks like now. The signs are not great. We are now in our third consecutive quarter of per capita recession, the longest period since the early 1980s downturn. With the absence of wages growth, with cuts to penalty rates and with rising household expenses such as electricity and child care, more needs to be done to complement interest rate cuts to put more back into people's pockets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what really gets up my nose, and what really shocked me in the last week, is how out of touch this government is. In this motion, the government wants to be congratulated; with all that negative economic data, it is out of touch. That little nobody Senator Anne Ruston—someone I'd never heard of; I had to google who it was; she just fell into the cabinet because there was no-one else—had the audacity to go out in the community and say pensioners are getting a generous handout from this government. You can hear the silence from the opposite side. No-one is defending the nobody Senator Anne Ruston—whoever she is. I've never heard of this person! She's lecturing everyone that the pension is somehow too good to be true: 'It's a generous amount of money that Australian taxpayers make available to our older Australians.' I bet that if you go to Mackay, and to the leafy suburbs that the member for Berowra represents, and say to pensioners, 'You've got too much money; you've got a generous handout'—who phrases terms like this? It is the minister responsible for administering those social payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard no contrition from the government whatsoever. They are lecturing everyone about responsibility and about tightening their belts. But what they say to pensioners is a big slap across the mouth from the minister responsible. I'm sure she'll be changed through that ministerial portfolio like the rest of them. To condemn senior citizens like this is disgusting. It's a sick joke, and I think the minister should go out and apologise. If that's how this government thinks they can treat pensioners—the member for Moreton, the member for Cooper and the member for Lyons, on this side of the House, will stand up for pensioners in the community.  Forget the fact that it was the opposite side of the chamber that tried to cut the pension. Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with the issue of deeming rates. This government was dragged kicking and screaming, by pensioners and by the Labor leader Anthony Albanese, to deliver a fair go for pensioners. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to move the motion that has been circulated in my name. The matter before the Federation Chamber recognises that, for Australian children who are in the education system right now, time is passing. As sung by Fleetwood Mac, and I think by the Dixie Chicks, children get older. Australian children who commenced prep when the coalition formed government are now entering their final semester of primary school, and those students who commenced high school when the coalition formed government have already transitioned to earning or learning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is about to commence its seventh year in office. The decisions it has made, or failed to make, have had real consequences on the educational outcomes of Australian children and young adults. Since the election of the coalition government in 2013, students, schools, universities and TAFEs have all been under constant attack. One of their first acts in government was to cut $30 billion over the decade from projected school funding. They've failed to restore cuts to public schools; failed to address the continuing decline in literacy and numeracy standards, much to our international shame; failed to provide adequate support to students, parents, teachers and principals; failed to address increasing fees for students undertaking vocational education and training; failed to address the decline in opportunities for apprenticeships and on-the-job training; reduced the threshold for repayment of student loans; capped university places; cut penalty rates; and failed to address the disconnect between higher education courses and industry demand for skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this Morrison-Frydenberg government's failure to address key issues in the Australian education system, Australian school students are continuing to fall behind in literacy and numeracy standards. Australia has fallen below Kazakhstan in the global education report card. How good is Kazakhstan! 150,000 fewer young Australians have the opportunity to undertake apprenticeships. Young Australians are having to repay their student loans when they are earning barely more than the minimum wage. Thousands of clever young Australians are missing out on the opportunity of a university education. Many young Australians are missing out on vital classroom contact hours because they have to work longer to make up for those penalty rate cuts to weekend pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coalition government should hang its head in shame that education standards for children growing up in Australia are falling on its watch. What a disgraceful legacy! Every Australian child deserves a world-class education system not only for their future but also for the prosperity of our nation. Countries around the world are investing in their education systems but, sadly, the Liberal Party and the National Party are letting Australian kids down. As a parent I know that the best future investment any parent can make is in their child's education. The same is true for this nation. The best investment we can make in our future prosperity is to invest in our education system but, sadly, this is an investment that the coalition has failed to see as having much value at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month the Productivity Commission released its research paper <span style="font-style:italic;">The demand-driven univers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ity system; a mixed report card</span>. The Productivity Commission, not exactly a left-wing think tank, was particularly concerned about the retention and completion rates of university students. The report commences with this paragraph:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">University can be transformative. Most university students succeed academically and go on to rewarding careers. On average, they earn higher wages and are less likely to be unemployed—which means higher taxes and lower social security benefits—and they make the economy more innovative and adaptive.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">An economic evaluation of higher learning from the Productivity Commission—yet this lost coalescence of a coalition government over there still sees no value in funding education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always been the party of education. It is the great transformational policy and our resolve remains unchanged. Labor is committed to a lifetime of education and to making sure that every Australian has the opportunity to obtain a great education. Our economy can only benefit from investment in education. It delivers increased productivity, a skilled workforce and the jobs of the future. I call on this coalition government under Prime Minister Morrison to urgently address the multiple issues facing Australia's education system—problems that have surfaced under their watch—to support public education and reverse the cuts that they have delivered; to address literacy and numeracy standards, which have fallen on their watch; to make sure young Australians can afford to go to university or TAFE so that we get our brightest and best people at university to create the jobs of the future; and to ensure Australia's future workforce has the skills it needs. Listen to the economists, listen to the educators, listen to the parents in your communities and invest in Australian education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I'm going to break with tradition and say that I don't agree with the motion. I will speak on it but merely to demonstrate the absurdity with which it was moved. The motion moved by the member makes the biggest list of grab-bag calls for every single thing under the sun as a way of perpetuating relevance for an opposition that simply has no agenda but complaint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is we all have empathy. The foundation of equal opportunity is, of course, education. It was Prime Minister Gladstone, the great liberal Prime Minister, who introduced in the UK the universal Elementary Education Act. It's liberalism that believes in the power of education. We Liberals, encourage people to realise the fullness of their lives regardless of their background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not pretending that, from time to time, other political philosophies don't co-opt liberalism. In fact, when you have no political philosophy that anchors or guides you, as with the opposition, I can entirely see the alluring attraction of liberalism. But to give the speech that the member just gave he would have to have gone not to education but to re-education to distract himself from the realities of what this government is doing. There is apparently, according to the member who spoke before, no money spent on education in this country, which would come as a bit of a shock, I think, to most parents who send their kids to schools. One of the things that makes it so absurd is not just that we fund education to record levels—and we do—but that actually we fund public, Catholic and independent education to record levels that have never been seen before under a Liberal or a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even more than that, we have a skills package investing $525.3 million through a range of measures to try to confront the challenges that young Australians face to give them the best chance in life. There's the National Careers Institute, the national careers ambassador program, the Foundation Skills for Your Future Foundation, the streamlined incentives for Australian apprenticeships, the additional identified skills shortages payment, industry training hubs, the national partnership with the Tasmanian government to enable Tasmania to train a skilled work force, 400 Commonwealth scholarships to young Australians, a national skills commission and pilot skills organisations, an extension to the National Rugby League’s VET Apprenticeship Awareness Program, phase 3 of the jobs and education data infrastructure program and an extension to the unique student identifier service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, what we have done at every point under this government is actually meet the expectations of the country and the challenges it faces. Our focus is on what we need to do not just to secure the retirement of Australians who came under direct assault from the opposition and not just to provide the record funding for education and improvement in standards which is the heart of our package—and you will see more about that through the life of this government—for young Australians. It is to make sure that at every point we try to improve the standards to make sure that, once people finish school and choose to go into tertiary education, they then have pathways to choose for the rest of their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, like economic growth or lower taxes, these are foreign concepts to our political opponents. Perhaps that's a reminder of why they sit on the other side of not just this chamber but the big one downstairs. It's because they simply do not appreciate or understand the challenges that Australians face. This is the gift and the opportunity of this government off the back of a strong budget position and off the back of a surplus which members like the member for Chifley call a vanity project. I wonder whether the members opposite think that a budget surplus is a vanity project or not. They rhetorically say they support the idea. Swannie even promised it. But the easier thing to do was to get rid of Swannie rather than have him around musking up like a bad smell.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Moreton—the member for Goldstein might remember that—which I'm very pleased to second because there's no more crucial role for government than to deliver an education system which, I agree, acts as the greatest social equaliser of all and offers the best chance for opportunity for anyone who wants to take it. On that measure, as this motion outlines, the government gets a big F for 'fail'. The member for Goldstein is leaving, but he has been rolled out tonight to defend the indefensible a couple of times, I see—well done! The government gets a big F because they think if you want a good education you should pay for it. Education is a matter of livelihoods, health and happiness, and governments should provide it. Yet the future opportunities for young Australians have been curtailed by the inability of the government to address the education needs of Australian students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Cooper, education is the No. 1 issue raised with me, and that's why I'm proud of Labor's education policies, which highlight a real commitment to getting the best outcome for kids. Labor would have restored the Liberals' cuts to our schools, especially public schools, which have had $14 billion ripped away from them—$14 billion under the Liberals. Sure, the Liberals have committed to restoring funding to Catholic and independent schools, where you have to buy an education, but no such commitment has been made for public schools. Public schools teach two-thirds of Australian children, the majority of children in remote and rural areas, the majority of Indigenous children, the majority of children with a disability and the majority of children with a CALD background. Labor would have boosted funding by $14 billion nationwide, $18 million of which would have benefited the kids in the schools of my electorate of Cooper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially for Cooper's families, this boost in funding would have allowed schools to deliver wraparound services like speech pathologists, social workers, family liaison officers and domestic violence case workers, as well as smaller class sizes, more teachers and more one-to-one attention. We know how important these services are. Caring for the students and their families holistically allows them to thrive. It allows their communities to thrive. In Cooper, Thornbury High School is managed by scrimping some funds together to offer some professional psychological supports to their students. This support is crucial for so many reasons and is accessible to all their kids. The school credits the support service with dramatically increasing the pass rates of students as well as their wellbeing. It's not rocket science. Why would any government deny the ability for all schools to provide such care as this without having to sacrifice other vital services?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow assistant minister for skills, I can say with some authority that the government, who have been in power for over half a decade, are not only failing school students; they are failing to students in the vocational, education and training sector as well. Since they were elected, they have severely damaged VET, cutting more than $3 billion in funding, presiding over a drop of 150,000 apprentices, closing TAFE campuses and allowing dodgy for-profit providers to gouge the system. TAFE and vocational education funding and the number of supported students are lower now than they were over a decade ago. This is despite an increasing number of jobs requiring vocational skills. For students enrolling in VET, it has meant an unaffordable cost shifted to them, fee increases, limitations on access, and unequal treatment across the post-school sector, not to mention poorer quality courses. The threshold for student loan repayments has been reduced while young people are struggling to find decent, secure work with a wage they can live on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many things this government has turned its hand to, the assumption that a market-driven, privatised approach will build a better, more efficient sector has been proven completely false. Last week I met with an incredible bunch of TAFE educators and AEU members. They spoke to me about what it's like to watch the great institution of TAFE suffer through years of a neo-Liberal government, the death by a thousand cuts, privatisation by stealth, declining hours teachers have, unstable work environments and anxiety created by precarious jobs in the sector. Unlike those who sit opposite, Labor knows that a well-functioning VET sector has TAFE at its heart, setting the benchmark for quality and standards. The minister for skills, Michaelia Cash, said she wants to see the VET and university sectors on equal footing, but we are yet to see the Liberals commit to the funding and reform required to achieve this important outcome. The answer to the ongoing demise of the VET sector is a $525 million skills package, but that is only $54.5 million in new funding for the sector. We need to see a commitment from this government to our youth. We need to see a commitment to public and TAFE education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  Deputy Speaker, you may have heard, as I have, that, since achieving at the last election the lowest primary vote it has had since the Great Depression, Labor has embarked on a listening tour around the country. But, after what we've heard from those opposite, I have to say that they haven't listened very hard, because we've effectively heard the same tired talking points that we heard in the last parliament, and in this motion we're hearing the same ideas that Labor peddled in the last parliament. It's the same old Labor with the same old lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people didn't just reject Labor's $387 billion of new taxes at the last election; they rejected Labor's record of failure in relation to schools, higher education and skills training. Labor never tires of giving us lectures in this place about schools funding. But, rather than actually implementing the Gonski funding regime when they had the chance, they ran around the country doing 27 special deals. Their deals were largely criticised by those people who authored the Gonski funding. They flew in the face of Labor's rhetoric of equity, fairness and 'giving a Gonski'. As education minister in the former government, the member for Maribyrnong cut $1.2 billion from government schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's failures extended to the time they last won government from opposition. Upon taking office, they promptly splurged $8 billion on schools halls. Most schools didn't want the money. It was money that could've gone to train teachers, buy school resources or invest in student wellbeing. They wasted $2 billion on their failed Laptops for Kids program. The member for Moreton comes in here and gives us a lecture about literacy and numeracy. Meanwhile, the seeds of the results that we're getting, where we're being beaten by Kazakhstan and Slovenia, were sown from the fruits of Labor's last policy, when they spent $540 million on a failed literacy and numeracy program. They even spent $16 million to recruit only 14 new teachers. Under Labor, grades went down and our global ranking suffered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we heard about higher education. Labor doesn't like to talk a lot about this, but the truth is that in the last budget before the Labor Party lost office they announced cuts of $6.6 billion to higher education and research. They removed incentives from universities to meet performance standards. International educational went backwards under Labor and their failed VET FEE-HELP policy left thousands of students with massive debts and no qualifications. This caused enormous international damage to Australia's VET reputation—damage that had to be cleaned up by our government. We've cleaned up Labor's mess and we've delivered record funding in the school, university and vocational education sectors. We abolished the special deals Labor created and we created a genuine needs based funding arrangement: an extra $37 billion for all schools, an average increase of 62 per cent per student. This brings total school funding to over $310 billion—funding we can actually guarantee thanks to our strong economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Schools in my electorate of Berowra are going to benefit to the tune of an extra billion bucks over the funding period of the next 10 years, and it doesn't matter whether they're independent, Catholic or government schools. Our government has also secured the agreement of every state and territory, including the Labor states, to this program. Funding for students with disability attending schools is at record levels and growing, and, by working with the Smith Family, we're committing an additional $4.9 million to boost the attendance of disadvantaged students who can least afford to miss out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor often misses the point that quality education is not only about money; it's also about good teachers and best practice. That's why we're investing deeply in improving teaching with phonics. We're ensuring phonics is included in university teaching courses so new teachers can use it in their classrooms. We're investing $15 million in an excellent organisation, Teach For Australia, to train high-achieving teachers who'll become high-quality school leaders in rural, remote and disadvantaged schools, which will help improve performance. We're providing more funding to train teachers in STEM subjects to give the next generation of graduates the skills they need for the jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's motion also says nothing about regional Australia, and that's largely because they don't represent regional Australia anymore. Only the Liberal-National government will spend $15 million this year to create five further regional study hubs, with additional Commonwealth supported places to support students to study their university courses in their local communities. I know that many coalition members who are regional members have been at the forefront of advocating for these very important regional study hubs. In universities we've increased funding by 19 per cent, and by 2022 that increase will be 28 per cent. We've invested $490 million to help students from regional Australia access universities. Our government is committed to a vision for Australia's education future. The Labor Party remains stuck in the past.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  As always, I jump at the opportunity to speak in this place on education. I thank my colleague the member for Moreton for bringing this motion before the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very well established principle, in terms of growth and development and the flow-on effects, and the opportunities that that has for jobs, that there are two significant issues that a country needs to get right. One is investment in education at all levels and the other is infrastructure. At the end of the day, as many of those opposite have said on many occasions, it's not the government that creates jobs but it is the government that creates the environment in which the opportunity to create jobs occurs. For these two aspects of government responsibility, I would have to say that education has been an abysmal failure for this government. Almost seven years in government and I could not tell you—and I very much doubt anybody could tell you publicly—what the education agenda is of this government or of any of the variations that have preceded it. There is never an articulated view of what the future of our education system should be. There is never prosecution of a case of the contribution of education to economic growth and development, and its ability to ensure equality within that so that all people get an opportunity to share in it. At most, what we get is that some of the old diehards here will get up in a debate like this, rattle off a shopping list of things and say, 'The government's putting more money into this and putting more money into that.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague the member for Moreton indicated, of course, as the population increases, the size of the government's expenditure increases. But the reality is that the agenda that was established by the previous Labor government, which was well articulated, well discussed, across all sections of education and within a framework looking at the way in which education contributes to economic growth and the sharing of prosperity—those particular reforms were critically important to the opportunity for growth and development, and the government has made cuts. For example, in the school education sector, as many of my colleagues have talked about, there was a $14 billion cut to the money that was projected to go to schools. Those opposite say it wasn't a cut. Let me ask them this question, if they want to make that argument: when the Catholic system said it had had a cut and the government said 'Oh, yes, you have had a cut. We'll reinstate your funding,' how does that apply to one sector but they say there hasn't been a cut on the public education side? If the Catholic system had a cut and got its money reinstated, that means the public sector, under the same funding system, had a cut and it has not been reinstated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of you would know, I am very passionate about the vocational education sector. If I have to listen to one more minister from that side get appointed to this portfolio, get up and say, 'The big problem with the vocational education sector is it's got an image problem'—time and time again, every new minister trots off to the media, saying: 'I'm going to tell people the vocational education sector is great. I'm going to tell people they should be getting young people into apprenticeships, because there's an image problem and we need to fix this.' First, you don't fix an image problem by constantly cutting funding. The poor old vocational education sector has had a cut in every budget and MYEFO; I've followed every single one of them. Every now and then, the government, under so much pressure and embarrassment, will throw a bit of money at a particular program but none of it is actually increasing participation. Every single cut has had the impact of tearing the heart out of the vocational education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous member said, 'What are Labor's views on the importance of the TAFE sector?' The previous speaker in this debate said, 'Why doesn't Labor ever talk about regional areas?' I tell you what: when you go into regional areas, one of the things they really care about is their TAFE. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I thank the honourable member for bringing this to our attention. This is an issue which is very important to me. Vocational education and training is an issue which is very important to me, as is tertiary education, university education. I don't know how many people in this place have done a trade or been TAFE educated and university educated, but I am one of them. And I can say without a shadow of a doubt—and this might make sense to members opposite—that I am who I am because of my vocational education and training background as a carpenter and joiner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, one of the problems that we have in Australia is that, ever since around the years of the Gillard government, all young people were told that you need to go to university if you want to be someone. That has had a lasting impact on all those young people who didn't go to university. They are now having their own children, and there is still the concept that, if your son or daughter is going to be someone, they need to go to university and get a law degree, an economics degree, an accounting degree or a business degree. We are facing a situation where many young people now feel that they have to go to university. But in my view we need to encourage young people by telling them that, if they want a qualification as a tradesperson, they can contribute to society just as well as someone who goes to university.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WALLACE:</span>
                  </a>  I will tell you why in a moment. If you just shush, you might learn something! The problem with doing a trade is that, out of a four-year apprenticeship, an employer will really only get about one year of productiveness out of that apprentice. The reality—and I can speak for this because I have been through it—is that, as a first-year apprentice, you are next to useless. As a second-year apprentice, you are getting better but still not earning the boss any money. By the third year, the apprentice is starting to do well and is able to earn his or her keep. By the fourth year, the apprentice has become so expensive that you could actually employ a subcontractor for less. So you will get one fruitful year, economically, out of an apprentice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we on this side are introducing a new policy whereby the government will provide very significant subsidies. The government will provide a wage subsidy of up to 75 per cent for a first-year apprentice, 50 per cent in their second year and 25 per cent in their third year. We on this side understand that we have got to fill this skills shortage. If we don't fill this skills shortage, we are going to have to import tradespeople from overseas. It would be an absolute disgrace if we had to go down that route. We have to encourage young people. We have to give them a sense of pride in their work. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a skilled tradesperson; in fact it is a matter of pride. If you work for yourself as a plumber or electrician, by and large, you will earn more money than you will if you get a business degree. So, young people, go and get an apprenticeship and earn yourself some decent money and start your own businesses.</span>

Both the focus and the funding for vocational education in South Australia has been under sustained pressure for many years. The three TAFE sites in Mayo—Mount Barker, Victor Harbor and Kangaroo Island—work hard but with incredibly limited resources, facilities and equipment. I was impressed with how much TAFE was able to do with so little, but significant additional investment is clearly needed. Higher education continues to rise in importance. Not everyone is cut out to be a university student and not everyone should be. Quality investment in vocational education leads to quality, worthwhile jobs. This is why before the federal election I made a commitment to the people of Mayo that I would advocate strongly for additional investment in Mayo's TAFE campuses. Briefly, I will summarise the more prominent benefits additional investment in local TAFE could achieve across hospitality, age and disability care, and building and construction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adelaide Hills region is well known as the destination for food, wine, hospitality and tourism. The region is home to over 35 recognised wineries and cellar doors, complemented by a number of restaurants, cafes, microbreweries, hotels and accommodation. Demand for skills and labour across the tourism and hospitality sector continues to grow in the region. The challenge is that it is incredibly hard for our young people to get the skills needed to provide a career pathway and ongoing opportunities. Additional investment would allow the establishment of a true centre for excellence in front-of-house hospitality and tourism training and a move towards the possibility of developing a fully functioning training cafe, which would see students able to provide live service to students, community members and small business start-ups attached to the new community centre and business incubator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mount Barker and the surrounding region contains more than 30 residential aged-care and disability facilities. Victor Harbor and its surrounding region contains more than 15 residential aged-care and disability facilities. The move towards individualised and specialised service provision through individual care plans and the National Disability Insurance Scheme has created an unparalleled shortage of new workers. Refurbishing the existing skills labs at both campuses would create a significant expansion and deliver a greater capacity for training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no fewer than 18 different building and housing developments underway across my region of the Adelaide Hills, in close proximity to Mount Barker, with many more set to start. Mount Barker is projected to grow to 55,000 people by 2036 and become South Australia's second biggest city. Despite that enormous growth and despite that being one of fastest-growing areas of South Australia and a major construction hotspot, the Mount Barker TAFE campus is currently unable to deliver genuine live training in building and construction. It makes no sense. The development of a wet-trades specific training space and the procurement of heavy plant equipment would provide this capacity and allow local would-be workers to be locally trained and employed. At the Victor Harbor campus, the purchasing of racking and liftable materials would enable the campus to locally deliver fork-lift licences to the Fleurieu Peninsula, instead of requiring trainees to travel 70 to 90 kilometres to Mount Barker or to Tonsley. And I have not even detailed the benefits that can be secured in the automotive and IT programs as well as in early childhood education and care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, we have seen a slow eroding of funding for vocational education and a slow eroding of value. We have members in here saying how important it is. I agree with them: it is important. But you've got to put your money where your mouth is. We need to properly fund vocational education. We are not doing it now and we can do better. I will continue my advocacy to the state government and to the federal government until they too share a vision that recognises that we need to invest now in vocational education if we want to find the one million workers that we are going to need in aged care. If we want to ensure the NDIS is a properly funded and workable model, we need to have the skills set now. We can do it. It is time to get out the chequebook.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I would like to thank the honourable member for Moreton for bringing this motion forward. He is one of the people who have truly earned the moniker 'honourable'. I'd like to think the members for Cooper, Calwell, Cunningham and Mayo for their contributions to this debate, as well as my colleague from Goldstein—I think he is a frustrated teacher or maybe even a lecturer; he is more in the didactic model of Socrates—and the members for Berowra and Fisher, who brought their own particular interests and knowledge to this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think where we have got to in this debate is a great shame, and I mean that sincerely, because there is no doubt that I'm going to stand here and tell those opposite who remain that their arguments that we have cut spending are just wrong, and they're going to argue until they're blue in the face that I'm wrong, and all of us are going to engage in mathematical models that would put quantum physicists to shame. But the truth of the matter is that this is about more than funding. We know that education is the golden bullet. As a member of the Liberal Party, which believes primarily in equality of opportunity above equality of outcome, I know that access to education for everyone is the most important thing that any society can provide if you are to live that creed which you say you live by. So, for me, this is just the most critical thing that any government can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to break the cycle of poverty. I know the member for Cunningham and the member for Moreton see in their community, as I see in mine, a third or fourth generation of children repeating the mistakes of their parents. They are going to live terrible lives, because we cannot break that cycle. It is heartbreaking to go to school presentation nights and see people with enormous potential. There is no reason why they cannot be so much more, but they are trapped by the environments into which they were born. No matter what we do to try to break that, we have failed. Frankly, too often the policies of this parliament have made that even worse. Education is the golden bullet for breaking that cycle. We have a choice between being the parliament of interest groups in education or the parliament that delivers for the children of this nation and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I really want all of us to put politics aside, because this subject is too important. The member for Mayo ended her speech by saying it's time to get out the chequebook. More disappointing words will be spoken in this chamber, I know, but that was just so disappointing, because too often we boil education down to how much money we can throw at it. We know from overseas that money is not the answer. It is an element of it, but Singapore, which has an education system that leaves ours for dead, funds its students at 30 per cent per student of what we do in Australia. We know that, as we have increased funding in Australia, education outcomes have gone down. I know correlation is not causation, I know that there are underlying factors, but, as I or anyone who stands in this parliament today knows, there is a negative correlation between education funding and outcomes. It's not good enough. Singapore have chosen to trade off class sizes. They have much larger classes than we do, with higher pay for teachers and better support for those teachers, like master teachers and other specialties that they can provide for teachers in planning to make those things. We know that there has been too much stress in our education environment on getting people to universities. In some of the most successful nations in the world, with the lowest levels of youth unemployment, such as Germany and Singapore, they have 80 per cent of people going into trades and technical colleges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />There is so much more that I want to say about this, but there is politicisation of education. In my area, there are public schools that have fair funding on their things. There are principals who throw out my congratulation notes to students who've won awards—because they can. They can make sure that I'm not allowed to speak to students. That politicisation has to end. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
