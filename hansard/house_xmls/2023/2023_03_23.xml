                    </a>  by leave—I rise today, as the Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, to speak on the annual report of the Integrity Commissioner for 2021-22. Under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity has a statutory role to examine each annual report prepared by the Integrity Commissioner. The committee held a public hearing on 8 February 2023 in order to examine the report and to speak with ACLEI about its performance over the reporting period, which was 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The committee heard that ACLEI performed well against its performance framework in 2021-22, achieving most of its performance targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The areas requiring work were: improving time lines and assessing work in investigations. These areas have come into sharp focus with the preparation for ACLEI to become part of the newly formed National Anti-Corruption Commission, NACC, in mid-2023. The Integrity Commissioner told the committee that ACLEI had three key priorities for the remainder of its time: firstly, to complete the legislative requirements for ACLEI; secondly, to finish ACLEI well, meaning ACLEI is in a fortunate position of knowing it is coming to an end, and it will take the opportunities over the next two months to celebrate all that that committee has achieved; and, finally, to work with the Attorney-General's Department on the establishment of the NACC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the areas for improvement, the committee was pleased to hear about the effort in order to reduce the backlog of investigative reports, but the committee notes in its report that this effort will need to be sustained given the number of matters that may be referred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard that recruitment was a major focus for the reporting period. While investigative teams have grown, recruiting specialised skills such as those of investigators and intelligence analysts in this already small market with a tight labour market will be a significant challenge for the NACC. The committee noted various strategies that had been put in place, such as broadening the pool of ACLEI's officers over time beyond a law enforcement background, and opening offices outside of Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting the upcoming establishment of the NACC, the committee was pleased to see that ACLEI is now sharing information with a broader remit beyond agencies in its jurisdiction. For example, ACLEI has published its second annual <span style="font-style:italic;">Corruption </span><span style="font-style:italic;">vulnerabilities brief</span>, and the Integrity Maturity Framework has now been developed. The committee noted the importance of this work, as agencies will come under NACC's jurisdiction with differing levels of maturity in relation to their integrity framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee thanked the Integrity Commissioner and the staff for their work over the reporting period.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:06</span>):  I rise today to join with many others in speaking in favour of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. This bill amends the Ministers of State Act 1952 to provide for greater transparency and accountability at the Commonwealth level of Australia's system of government by ensuring that the Australian people are able to access information in relation to the composition of the federal Executive Council, those who have been appointed to administer departments of state and the offices that ministers of state hold. It's difficult to believe that this was truly necessary. To me, as a long-term Canberran, this is still one of the most extraordinary parts of the record of the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this legislation is reactive. It's being introduced because the member for Cook went behind the backs of his closest cabinet colleagues and was appointed to administer multiple portfolios during 2020 and 2021—the departments of health; finance; industry, science, energy and resources; Treasury; and home affairs—in addition to his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We now know, from revelations in the last couple of weeks, that there were further secret appointments. Such a lack of transparency is indicative of a lack of respect for the institutions of government, a lack of confidence in ministerial government and, in terms of the general public, a particular lack of respect for a public that has a right to know who is running their government and who administers particular portfolios. The Albanese Labor government was elected with a mandate to restore public trust in the institutions of government and in government itself. The cornerstone of this is the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. That legislation was passed in the parliament late last year. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 follows the same core principles that underpin the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this power grab was discovered, it was once again up to Labor to clean up another mess from the former government. I will take this opportunity to remind the House how this government responded. On 26 August last year, the Prime Minister and Attorney-General announced the establishment of an inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments. That inquiry was led by the former High Court Justice Hon. Virginia Bell KC, with a final report being provided to the government on 25 November last year. Those opposite labelled it a political witch-hunt. What a shock! Well, we found a witch. This inquiry was not about politics. It was about working out how the former Prime Minister was able to be sworn into five key portfolios, without having to notify the Australian public or even his own cabinet. Our parliamentary democracy relies on basic government transparency as a critical means to provide checks and balances. As the Solicitor-General made clear:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for the Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the whole of the previous parliament, I well recall the number of questions which were put to the Prime Minister but were then referred off to ministers despite the fact that, we now know, he actually had the capacity to respond directly to those questions himself, because he had that ministerial responsibility provided to him in secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill demonstrates the government's readiness to act promptly to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials. The measures in the bill will restore integrity and transparency to the process of appointing elected officials to high office and ensure we have a system of government where there are checks and balances. Never again will one person be able to garner powers without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. I will always advocate for and encourage greater accountability in government. I represent a large population of current and former public servants who have strict guidelines that they have to follow, and they expect their ministers to do the same. The member for Cook's inability to hold himself to the highest level of accountability, which his former office expected of him, is deeply concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When speaking with journalist Niki Savva, the former member for Kooyong said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I don't think there was any reason for Scott to take on the additional Treasury portfolio. The fact he did take it, and it was not made transparent to me and others, was wrong and profoundly disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was extreme overreach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When his then deputy declares it as 'extreme overreach', what does it say about the judgement and motives of the former Prime Minister?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is about transparency. The introduction of this bill shows that this government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics. The measures in this bill will go some way to provide greater integrity and transparency around the process of appointing elected officials to high office and especially to ensure we have a system of government where one person cannot again, as I said earlier, garner powers without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will require the Official Secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument, registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, as soon as reasonably practicable, that the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn in an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council; appointed an officer to administer a department of state; or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It will also require such a notification on the revocation of any of these positions. The notifiable instrument will include the name of the person; the department of state, where appropriate; and the date on which they were sworn, appointed or directed. In the case of revocation, the notifiable instrument is to include the name of the person, the name of the former office, and the date that such membership, appointment or direction was revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite wouldn't know what accountability or integrity was, and the Australian people shared that view last May. That's why this government has continued to roll out multiple pieces of legislation to restore integrity and transparency in the federal government. That's why the Albanese government introduced long-overdue reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which will put Australia on the path to a best-practice whistleblowing framework for the public sector. In my working life before coming here, I represented public sector workers across a whole range of Commonwealth agencies. I've had the great privilege of working with people with great integrity, who at times have needed to shine a light on public sector maladministration or corruption. The need for greater whistleblower protection and the ongoing need for integrity reform is clear to me, and it's a privilege to speak on this bill as part of the greater moves to address these issues. There is still work to be done, but already the reforms in the first year of the Albanese government have led to an improvement in our global corruption perceptions ranking, as the latest Transparency International data shows. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's work in restoring accountability does not stop with greater whistleblower protection or with the reforms in this bill. The passing of our National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation last year was a great step in increasing government transparency and integrity. I'd like to take this opportunity to remind those opposite what the National Anti-Corruption Commission looks like. The commission will operate independently of government, with a full suite of powers similar to those of a royal commission. It will have discretion to commence inquiries into serious or systemic corruption on its own initiative or in response to referrals, including from whistleblowers, who will have strong protections, and there will be exemptions for journalists to protect the identity of sources. It will have the discretion to undertake investigations, of both criminal and non-criminal conduct, and to refer matters to another agency or to take no action. It will be able to refer findings that could constitute criminal conduct to the Australian Federal Police or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. It will have the power to investigate allegations of serious or systemic corruption that occurred before or after its establishment. After what we've seen over recent years, and the diminishing public trust in government as a consequence, this is extremely important. We are establishing a National Anti-Corruption Commission with real power and authority. Importantly, our approach consistently meets the path of cooperation and collaboration so that all Australians are heard. The establishment of a National Anti-Corruption Commission begins the important work of restoring the faith of the Australian people in their parliament and government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will continue to lead on matters of national integrity and transparency. This government understands that everyday Australians are losing trust in their political system and that we need a comprehensive approach that will go further than maintaining the status quo but ensures the federal government operates with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. This is not some sort of victory for the government. It's effectively a key to ensure that Australians can have faith and trust in any of their governments. I thank the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General for the hard work they have done in this space in restoring confidence and trust to government in relation to the NACC, enhanced whistleblower protections and now with this legislation to ensure that the Australian people are notified when there has been a change in ministerial arrangements. I would encourage all members in this place to support this bill to take one further step to restore public confidence in government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, as a Canberran it baffles me that this bill was ever necessary. If there's one part of the day that nearly all Australians are familiar with, and often judge this place on, it is question time. That is the most visible part of the day, and it is a part of the day when there is an expectation that ministers who have responsibility for portfolios will respond to questions that come from electorates all around the country, whether they be represented by the opposition or by the government. It's still extraordinary to me that, for a significant period of time, without any explanation, the Australian people were hoodwinked. Effectively, when questions were asked of the Prime Minister, where the Prime Minister had assumed responsibility for a number of portfolios, those questions were not answered. That responsibility was not acknowledged. It was, certainly, an extraordinary act of bad faith for members of the government of the day, an extraordinary lack of both trust and confidence in their capacity to do the jobs for which they were appointed. It was an extraordinary breach of faith and confidence with the Australian people, something that we should ensure never happens again in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australians all around the country are watching or listening to question time or to other parts of the day when legislation is introduced, they should have a firm understanding of who is responsible and who is accountable for the work that goes on in this place. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:20</span>):  I commend the words of the member for Bean because it is quite extraordinary, and still hard to fathom, that for a very long period of time we sat on those opposition benches questioning the government and the Prime Minister—the then prime minister, the member for Cook. He knew things that he was not disclosing to the parliament. He knew things his own ministers didn't know. The very premise of this parliament, the premise that this is a place where governments can be held to account, particularly, as the member for Bean indicates, during question time, was really treated with contempt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the core of this legislation, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, and the efforts that we are making to ensure that cannot happen again, that this parliament cannot be treated like fools and can't be held in contempt because of a prime minister failing to disclose actions and decisions that he's made. He failed to disclose that he was, in fact, the minister for many, many things, not just his prime ministerial role. That is the core of this piece of legislation and why it is so important to have on the record the processes that have led to this point. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about restoring the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and part of rebuilding the integrity in public sector institutions, in the processes that we have and in the officials. It's also a key to ensuring that there is a capacity to hold a government and a prime minister to account. The bill will implement reforms to provide for greater transparency and accountability in the administration of this parliament, in the ministries and in the Commonwealth. It implements the first of the six recommendations from the Bell inquiry, so it isn't the only thing that we will be doing. It follows the steps that we've taken already so that we finally have, in this country, a National Anti-Corruption Commission. This is as important as that National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to walk through how we got to this point because this is historic—we have never been at this point before—and why it was so important that we censured the member for Cook on this matter. The Prime Minister has spoken about this issue, and I thank him for his leadership. But we should all be deeply saddened that a censure of a former prime minister was necessary. It is a real shame for all of us that this institution had to take that step because, had we not taken that step, we would have been saying: 'That's okay. Maybe it wasn't the best thing to do,' but we'd shrug our shoulders and he'd get away with it. It isn't something that can be overlooked. It is too dangerous a precedent to be setting by overlooking that sort of behaviour. That's why we are committed to addressing the loopholes that allowed that abuse of power to occur. I think the Australian people are absolutely entitled to know who is appointed to administer departments of this country because they make such profound decisions that have impacts on everybody's lives. I hope the Australian people recognise that that is the basis of our desire and determination to clean up this system so that what happened can't be repeated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just remind ourselves what actually happened, and we learnt some of this because of the Solicitor-General's advice. The advice from the Solicitor General was published in August last year, and that advice found that between March 2020 and May 2021 the member Cook was appointed by the Governor-General to administer five departments of state: Health; Finance; Industry, Science, Energy and Resources; Treasury and Home Affairs. This wasn't made public. It was only revealed through reports in the media. As a former journalist I have great regard for the role the media plays in revealing things, but, seriously, this is not something that should have been left to media to find out. It is something that should have been disclosed freely to the parliament. The Solicitor-General found that the principles of responsible government were fundamentally undermined by the actions of the former government. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for the parliament to hold ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just a fundamental principle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We learnt more through the Bell report. The Bell report, for me, was really, really key to understanding and allowing me to get to the real core and gravity of this. The Bell report found that the appointments were unnecessary. If either the then Minister for Health and Aged Care or the then Minister for Finance had become incapacitated and it was desired to have a senior minister exercise the health minister's expansive human biosecurity emergency powers or the finance minister's significant financial authorities, the member for Cook could have been:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… authorised to act as Minister for Health or Minister for Finance in a matter of minutes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It could have happened in a matter of minutes, so the excuse that we were in a pandemic and things were difficult was just a fallacy. Here we have the recognition that, had someone become incapacitated—another minister—that could have been resolved in a matter of minutes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other appointments, including to Treasury and Home Affairs, the Bell report found are in a different category to the Health and Finance appointments. The Bell report said these appointments had 'little if any connection to the pandemic'. It went on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather, Mr Morrison was appointed to administer these departments to give himself the capacity to exercise particular statutory powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We learnt all this thanks to the Bell report, and I commend the work of the Hon. Virginia Bell AC who did this work. She noted that the member for Cook also instructed the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to prepare a brief for his appointment to administer the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. Apparently, he decided not to proceed with that appointment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale of it is staggering. When asked to explain this, the Bell report noted it is difficult to reconcile the member for Cook's choice not to inform his ministers of the appointments 'out of his wish not to be thought to be second-guessing them, with his belief that the appointments had been notified in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Gazette</span>'. We've got two opposing thoughts here: 'I didn't want to alarm them and think they didn't have my confidence,' but 'Oh, I thought they were going to be noted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span> and gazetted.' That sort of language has given no-one any confidence that there was a desire for transparency and disclosure. If people haven't read the Bell report, I would encourage them to do so because it makes very clear what processes were involved and why we should be so concerned about what happened and why there is a need for this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's really what this is about. It's not about us and the parliament; it is about the responsibility we have to the people who have put us here, and that is to be transparent, to disclose things and to ensure that we are meeting their expectations around integrity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was surprising to know that there was an additional part to this story that was only very recently revealed. That was when we discovered that the member for Cook's secret appointments extended beyond himself. Documents released under freedom of information revealed that the approach of the previous coalition government, when it came to giving the Prime Minister, himself, additional portfolios, extended to other ministers, and multiple assistant ministers were appointed to multiple departments. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former member for Tangney was appointed to administer the home affairs department, and the member for Capricornia was appointed to administer the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. While these appointments were gazetted, the member for Cook specifically asked that there be no swearing-in ceremony, no public event held to show what was happening, no changes to the official ministry lists. That is a total breakdown in the trust upon which our democracy depends. </span>

It is a shameful page in the history of that government. There were multiple things for that government to be ashamed of, but this one, in particular, went to the core of what this place is about. It went to the heart of what we are here to do. This legislation will go a long way to ensuring we don't see a repeat of it. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires the Official Secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument registered on the Federal Register of Legislation as soon as reasonably practicable—not months later or only when FOI documents are revealed or only when someone tells it to a journalist for a book that's going to be published. It will say that the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council, appointed an officer to administer a department of state or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It will also require any notification when those positions change. </span>

Where an appointment has been revoked, it will include the name of the person, the name of the former office and the date that such membership, appointment or direction was revoked. The notifiable instrument may also comprise a copy of an instrument issued by the Governor-General, ensuring there are no loopholes and no ways to get around it; there is no way of sneakily putting it through.</span>

The centrepiece of this promise has been our legislation for a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission, and the provisions in this bill add to that. They go some way to ensuring greater integrity and transparency, and we will continue to look for ways to make sure the people of Australia know that we are accountable and that governments are held to account.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill. Integrity and accountability should be central to everything we do, both inside and outside this parliament. These qualities should be a constant, especially for parliamentarians like ourselves, not only because we should set and uphold those standards but because Australians demand and deserve their representatives to do so—to be honest and display integrity in every decision, every interaction and every behaviour. Our democracy demands those qualities and our democracy is worth protecting. Governments should operate in the nation's interests, governing for the people who elect us to represent them. This is how I serve my community of the electorate of Pearce. The community's interests and needs are first and foremost in my mind, as is operating with the highest level of integrity in advocating for all my constituents. I listen to my community, and what they tell me is that integrity is vitally important to them. That is why the response to the Albanese government's decision to establish the National Anti-Corruption Commission has been so positive. The National Anti-Corruption Commission has been warmly welcomed by the people of Pearce, and rightly so. Australians want and deserve accountability and integrity, and they will get that through the important work and oversight of the National Anti-Corruption Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of our community have been rightly horrified by some of the actions taken by the former government. One example was when they learnt that, between March 2020 and May 2021, the former Prime Minister and member for Cook was appointed by the Governor-General to administer five portfolios, in addition to his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The former Prime Minister had quietly helped himself to a few extra portfolio responsibilities. He'd kept his colleagues and the public out of the loop and created a secret stash of ministries on top of what he already had. This was nothing less than an extraordinary scenario. It left many people astonished when the news broke and the secret was revealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, just last week we discovered, through freedom of information requests, that the member for Cook's secret appointments extended beyond himself. Documents have revealed the assiduous approach of the previous coalition government in appointing ministers. Multiple assistant ministers were appointed to multiple departments. For example, the former member for Tangney was also appointed to administer the Department of Home Affairs and the member for Capricornia was also appointed to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. While these appointments were gazetted, the member for Cook specifically requested that there be no swearing in ceremonies—no public events to show what he was doing—and no changes to the official ministry lists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate that over the past decade the people's trust in politicians and politics has been eroded. We must change that. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill will go a long way to restoring that trust. It is important for my electorate of Pearce that I speak on this bill. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill provides for greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration, something Australians want and deserve. This bill will ensure that Australians are able to access information about the composition of the federal Executive Council. It will ensure Australians know who is appointed to administer certain departments of state and the high offices that ministers hold. It will prevent a situation ever again occurring whereby a Prime Minister can appoint himself or herself to ministries in secret, just as the former Prime Minister the member for Cook did. The former Prime Minister did so while his Liberal and National Party colleagues were blissfully unaware. It was a long list of roles, in the departments of health, finance, industry, science, energy and resources, Treasury and home affairs. Bear in mind that this was in addition to his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast we, the Albanese Labor government, are doing things differently, to have a positive impact on our nation, to make the lives of Australians better every day and in every way we possibly can. We are here for the Australian people, caring for and supporting families, businesses and organisations. We are creating a legacy of positive changes for our communities and our electorates. This is what drives us. I'm so honoured to be a part of this positive and lasting change. We are easing cost-of-living pressures by providing many positive changes that help families, including cheaper child care, because early childhood education is vitally important for life outcomes, and cheaper medicines, because we want to make sure people don't forgo the medication that they need because they can't afford it. For the first time in 75 years, the maximum cost of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has fallen. We made that happen. We are investing in social and affordable housing to tackle housing pressures. We are investing $10 billion to establish the Housing Australia Future Fund. Returns from the fund will be used to build 30,000 new social and affordable dwellings over five years. On wages, we are getting them moving again— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>I will continue. On wages, we are getting them moving again, supporting and standing up for lowest-paid workers as inflation bites. One of the Albanese government's first actions was to support wage increases for Australia's lowest-paid workers, to ensure their real wages do not go backwards. The Fair Work Commission delivered a minimum pay rise of $40 per week for full-time workers, benefiting around 2.7 million workers. We are supporting gender equality under workforce participation, which is great for our economy. We are supporting families and working parents by expanding paid parental leave, which has passed the Senate. This expansion is the biggest reform to the scheme since it was introduced. Expanding paid parental leave will enhance economic security, improve gender equality and increase participation and productivity. Importantly, it will support parents to spend more time with their children and share caring responsibilities more equally. These are some of the robust policies the Albanese government is driving for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back: when the government referred the former Prime Minister's secret appointments to the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC, Dr Donaghue advised that the principles of responsible government were 'fundamentally undermined' by the actions of the former government, and that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for the Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2022 our current Prime Minister and the Attorney-General announced the establishment of the Inquiry into the Appointment of the Former Prime Minister to Administer Multiple Departments. This was led by former High Court justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC. The final report by former High Court justice Bell was provided to the government in November last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ministers of State Amendment Bill forms part of the government's response to the Bell inquiry. The bill will amend the Ministers of State Act 1952 to provide for greater transparency and accountability at the Commonwealth level of Australia's system of government. In simple terms, it will achieve that by ensuring the Australian people are able to access information about who is doing what in government—simple, but absolutely necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bell inquiry was truly an extraordinary moment in time for Australian politics. The fact that a former High Court justice was required to investigate a former Prime Minister for swearing himself into multiple secret portfolios, and the fact that the former Prime Minister did so without notifying his colleagues—there can be no better, or should I say worse, example of a reason to need this bill than this secret-portfolio affair. Although, the shocking and damaging robodebt was also a dreadful and low moment in Australian politics that left the public reeling. And what about sports rorts? That was another funding disgrace by the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is good reason to establish an anticorruption body, as the Labor government is delivering. Democracy can be severely damaged by a lack of transparency. Politics and this place must be open, fair, decisive, responsible and caring, and above all else it must be accountable. We must—I repeat, we must—ensure transparency in our government processes. Our system of parliamentary democracy relies upon conventions and the Westminster traditions of checks and balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has accepted all the recommendations of the Bell inquiry into the former Prime Minister's sneaky, secret, squirrel ministries. Our progress on this matter shows the Albanese Labor government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics. At the heart of that is the establishment of the powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. The measures in the Ministers of State Amendment Bill will ensure integrity and transparency in the process of appointing elected officials to high office. Never again will one person be able to garner powers without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and the Australian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The actions of the former Prime Minister the member for Cook have been strongly condemned not just by the Australian public but by multiple former Liberal prime ministers too. The former Prime Minister appointed himself the Minister for Finance but did not even tell his own finance minister, an extraordinary move. The former Prime Minister had zero respect for the then finance minister to not even have mentioned his bizarre appointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every member of this place, including those opposite, should care about the integrity of our parliamentary process and the people who we are privileged to represent. We should be able to leave here with our heads held high, knowing that we served to the best of our ability with integrity, honesty and transparency and with heart. The Australian people deserve nothing less, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. I must say that, like so many other speakers on this side, I contribute to this debate still completely outraged about the actions of the member for Cook. It is quite overwhelming—and that's certainly what people in my electorate constantly tell me—with the size and scale of what happened here. The member for Cook actually took it upon himself to act in this manner and appoint himself to so many portfolios. So I think our outrage and concern is certainly more than warranted, and we hear that in the community all the time. People just find it amazing that this even happened. Never would I have ever believed that here in modern Australia a prime minister would actively seek to damage and distort our democratic processes, parliamentary conventions and Westminster checks and balances. It does seem completely remarkable that somebody would do that in such a way when we need to ensure there is faith in all of these institutions. The previous Prime Minister the member for Cook certainly undermined all of those through these actions. Never would I have thought that it would actually be necessary for there to be specific legislation to ensure that ministers can't be secret ministers. I think we all share that. We never thought we would be here having to speak on legislation like this, yet here we are, having to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just have a look at some of the actions of the member for Cook. Between March 2020 and May 2021, we know the former Prime Minister appointed himself to administer five portfolios in addition to his duties as Prime Minister. Last year out we found out that the member for Cook had appointed himself, firstly, as the Minister for Health on 14 March 2020; as the Minister for Finance on 30 March 2020; as the Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources on 15 April 2021; as the Minister for Home Affairs on 6 May 2021; and as the Treasurer on 6 May 2021—completely remarkable. When I say that when we found out we were all shocked, it wasn't just us on the side of the House. The general public everywhere were completely shocked, and we know that MPs who were members of the former Morrison government were equally shocked. Indeed, four members of the cabinet were very shocked as well and had no knowledge of it. I think when that news broke it was a bit overwhelming, and it still is. I think the reason people were outraged is that it was so devious and undermining to do that and to keep it all a secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really ironic about the actions of the member for Cook is that he was so eager to have these multiple portfolios of responsibility yet in actual fact he refused to take responsibility for anything. I think that is one of the many hypocritical parts about this. Instead, all we had was a decade of a Liberal-National government that really was bereft of any responsibility at all. That certainly was a characteristic that we saw time and time again with the member for Cook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, this lack of responsibility was very apparent in my region, with the devastating floods that we had just over a year ago. We've just had the first anniversary of those floods, and there is still a very long way for so many people to go with the size and scale and impact of the floods. But that anniversary that has just passed certainly reminded us of the inaction of the member for Cook. Firstly he failed to include the people in my electorate in some of the extended disaster payments, and that was devastating to people on the ground who had been through so much. Secondly, the member for Cook and former Prime Minster failed to come and talk to people on the ground throughout the area and hear firsthand what they had been through. He failed to take responsibility, as the Prime Minister, especially during those times of natural disaster. He was nowhere to be seen during the floods that devastated my region. When we look back also at the terrible bushfires over Christmas 2019, what was the response of the member for Cook and former Prime Minister? He said he didn't hold a hose—again, failing to take responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, there were many faults and flaws with the vaccine rollout and so many other issues. Again, according to the former Prime Minister, those were the job of somebody else. He would say: 'That's not my job. That's not my job.' It really is unforgivable for a prime minister to not take responsibility. Despite not taking responsibility for those issues, there was the member for Cook secretly having himself sworn in to take responsibility for all these other ministries. So many people in my region are really shocked, I think, and outraged because it is emphatically the job of the Prime Minister to maintain the public's confidence in political leaders and institutions. That is so vital to our nation. Yet here we are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud that the Albanese Labor government is taking decisive action with this bill to protect our democracy. The bill before us today has come about due to the very swift actions of our Prime Minister and Attorney-General in establishing an inquiry. The inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments was led by former High Court Justice Virginia Bell. These actions are, of course, in stark contrast to the actions of the member for Cook. Our bill will amend the Ministers of State Act 1952 to provide for greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration, ensuring that the people who actually vote us in here—the Australian public—have visibility over the offices that ministers hold. That is so vitally important. Really, it is the cornerstone of our democracy. Specifically this bill provides that the Official Secretary to the Governor-General must publish a notifiable instrument, which will be registered on the publicly accessible Federal Register of Legislation as soon as is reasonably practicable, advising that the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the federal Executive Council, appointed an officer to administer a department of state or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It's very important to have these measures in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are putting this bill forward now because it is so important to restore the confidence of the Australian people in our system of government and our institutions and to rebuild that integrity. This is a confidence Australians deserve to have. Anyone in this House can recognise how significant the actions of the member for Cook really have been. In fact, it's important to point out that three of his predecessors have come out and condemned this conduct. Former Prime Minister John Howard said: 'I don't think he should have done that. I don't think there was any need to do it, and I wouldn't have.' Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'I'm just not going to defend what was done. It is just highly unconventional, highly unorthodox and shouldn't have happened.' Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: 'This is sinister stuff. This is secret government. This is one of the most appalling things I've ever heard of in our federal government.' The very idea that a prime minister would be secretly sworn in to other ministries is incredible. I think those comments from those former prime ministers reflect the sentiment we felt at the time when we first heard about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then again, there were more developments recently. We discovered that the member for Cook's secret appointments extended beyond himself. We know that multiple assistant ministers were appointed to multiple departments. Ben Morton, the former member for Tangney, was appointed to administer the home affairs department. The member for Capricornia was appointed to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was all secretive. Whilst these appointments may have been gazetted, the member for Cook specifically requested that there be no swearing-in ceremony. There was secrecy surrounding it. There was no public event to show it was happening and no changes to official ministry lists—again, just more disregard for our democracy and our democratic institutions. In relation to these most recent revelations, the member for McPherson has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given what we've heard, it's not surprising that I wasn't told about it. It's not okay to behave in the way the former Prime Minister and others have in relation to keeping information secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… at no time during those discussions did Ben Morton raise with me the fact he had been appointed to administer that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just goes on and on. So we have the former Prime Minister not only appointing himself to portfolios but also secretly appointing other people to roles and, obviously, ensuring that that's kept secret as well. The member for McPherson continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's … extraordinary … it's very disappointing that this information is coming to light now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Who knows what the reason was behind any of that … there was no reason to keep that hidden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that reflects how we felt recently when that further information was revealed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is so important for us to restore faith in our democratic institutions and in our parliament. These are values we on this side hold very dear, and the Australian public do, and they deserve to. This bill, alongside our National Anti-Corruption Commission, will ensure that integrity can be restored. The commission will work to investigate and report on serious and systemic corruption. I was very proud to speak on this bill when it came to the House because that was a very big issue throughout the community for many, many years—they were calling for a national integrity commission. One of the major actions of our government was to introduce that. Under the previous government, they refused to do that for many, many years. They refused to have that particular commission in place that's so vitally important. We do that to restore faith in our institutions and our systems that the Australian people deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us here in this House, each and every one of us, are immensely privileged and honoured to be standing here, representing all areas right across this great country and also to be active participants in our democracy. We are incredibly privileged to be doing that. When actions are taken, like those of the member for Cook and the former Prime Minister, it does diminish that, because we know that, with the actions that the former Prime Minister took, it was impossible for the parliament and, therefore, the public to hold ministers to account for the running of departments. Members had no knowledge of what was going on at all. It is incredibly disappointing, and, in terms of the role of our parliament, it is incredibly wrong. It's important to have this new legislation in place to restore integrity. It must have been very disheartening for members across the chamber when it all came to light. It was incredibly disheartening for us and the entire general public. It still is absolutely absurd to think that someone in the role of prime minister could take that action as the former Prime Minister did and to just trash our democracy and our institutions, all of which we hold very dear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're committed to this legislation. It will fall to us—the Labor Party—to uphold the virtue of those institutions and the parliament, so that there is proper recourse and accountability, and we proudly do that because we believe in all those values and we fight for all those values. I certainly commend this bill to the House. It is very important. It will ensure that a person cannot ever again garner powers without that adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people, to the Australian parliament and to the House. It does reflect very. very poorly on the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister, in taking those actions, and he should rightly be condemned by people in this House and the general public for that. We very proudly commend this bill, and we will work to upholding the integrity of our institutions that we hold dear. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  The actions of the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, in secretly swearing himself into ministries in 2020 and 2021, without the knowledge of ministers and without the knowledge of the Australian people, is one of the darkest periods in our nation's democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a fundamental principle of Australian democracy that the people get to choose who administers government on their behalf and that the people have the right to know who is administering government departments on their behalf. That was taken away by the actions of the member for Cook. It fell to media reports for the Australian people to find out in August last year that the former Prime Minister had sworn himself into six portfolios, including Treasury, Health, Finance and Home Affairs—quite serious and large government departments—without telling the ministers who were previously sworn in to administer those departments but, more importantly, not telling the Australian people that he had taken over responsibility for those portfolios—and during a health crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that's remarkable about this is that it wasn't needed. He didn't need to conceal it from the Australian people. Given that we were in a health crisis, I'm sure if he had come out and said, 'Look, I've consulted with ministers and, given that people are getting sick and there's a great risk that many ministers may be struck down with COVID, we've taken the option of swearing additional people in to administer departments in case that occurs,' most people in the Australian public would have said, 'That's quite reasonable.' Certainly we, on this side of the chamber, would have said, 'Yes, that's something reasonable to do in a pandemic,' particularly, as the minister's pointed out, for the Department of Health. So it wasn't even needed. You'd have to question the motivations of the former Prime Minister the member for Cook in doing that. Why didn't he tell the Australian people? I'm sorry, but the justification that was given in the speech delivered by the member for Cook simply wasn't good enough. Australians were rightly horrified. They were horrified that they weren't told about this important principle of knowing who was administering government, particularly during a health crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we found out, of course, the Albanese government acted appropriately and referred the issue to the Solicitor-General, who recommended that a broader inquiry be undertaken, and we appointed a former High Court judge, Justice Virginia Bell, to look into the matter. She conducted a thorough inquiry and made a number of recommendations to the government in November last year. This bill is a result of those recommendations. It's the government acting on the recommendations that were made independently by Virginia Bell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will ensure that the Australian people are able to access information relating to the composition of the Federal Executive Council and those appointed to administer departments and offices that ministers hold. Specifically, it will require the Official Secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument, registered on the Federal Register of Legislation, that the Governor-General has summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council and to publish notification of revocation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>The notifiable instrument will include the name of the person, the department of state and the date on which they were sworn, appointed or directed. In cases of the revocation of the notifiable instrument, it will include the name of the person, the name of the former office and the date when such membership, appointment or direction was revoked. The notifiable instrument may also comprise a copy of an instrument issued by the Governor-General. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of the government restoring transparency and accountability to important decisions such as the swearing of ministers of state to administer government departments on behalf of the Australian people. It comes on the back of other reforms of this government that are aimed at improving transparency and accountability, most notably the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which, as we all know, the Australian people put front and centre of the recent election campaign because they wished to ensure there was government action on this issue. This government will make sure that the Australian people understand who their ministers of state are and know that they are administering government on their behalf. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This episode also demonstrates why we need to begin a serious debate once again about having one of our own as our head of state. I want to make the point that the Governor-General did nothing wrong in the circumstances he was put in by the former prime minister, the member for Cook. The Governor-General acted entirely appropriately in swearing the member for Cook into those ministries. The convention is, under our system, the Westminster system, that the Governor-General acts on the advice of the government of the day, and that is what the Governor-General did. There is no fault at all with the Governor-General. The fault lies with the member for Cook. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that had we had an Australian head of state, one that was appointed by the Australian people either indirectly through the parliament or directly by election then that head of state would be accountable to the Australian people. A head of state put in that situation, such as the one the member for Cook left the Governor-General with, would be obliged, in my view, to ensure that the Australian people were informed of the former prime minister being sworn into those ministries. At the moment the way the Governor-General is appointed, as we all know, is that the Governor-General is the King's or Queen's representative. They swear allegiance to the King or the Queen when they take office. Their obligation is to be the representative of the King or the Queen. </span>

In my view, if we had an Australian head of state that was appointed by the Australian people, either through the parliamentary process or directly elected by the Australian people, they would have an obligation to the Australian people to ensure that the fundamental principle of democracy is upheld—the right to know who is administering government on their behalf. In such a scenario, if the Prime Minister were say to the Australian head of state, 'I want you to swear me in to these ministries,' the head of state would of course be obliged to do so; however, having been appointed by the Australian people, I believe they would also be obliged to say, 'If you don't tell the Australian people, I will.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is another reason why, after we get through the process of looking at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, which is the priority of the government this year, we need to begin a serious discussion with the Australian people about, in the future, debating whether or not we should have one of our own as our head of state, someone who is accountable to the Australian people and who represents Australia's unique culture and identity, improving the system of democracy that we have and cherish in Australia. Hopefully, some good can come of this dark period in our history when the Australian people were left none the wiser about who was administering government on their behalf, because of that dastardly act of the former Prime Minister to attempt to cover up—and that's implicit in the fact that he didn't tell anyone—the fact that he'd taken the ministries of other ministers, attempting to hide it from the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, we now have a government that prioritises transparency and accountability. This bill delivers on the commitment to ensure that we have transparency and accountability in our decision-making, particularly when it comes to who is administering government on behalf of the Australian people. In the future, because of this reform, the Australian people will always know who has been sworn in as a minister of state and who is administering government departments on their behalf.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  It is extraordinary that we're standing here today discussing the need for a bill to ensure that the public is informed when a ministry is assumed. We have a proud Westminster system, which we've inherited from our British brothers and sisters. This is something that's based on conventions and principles, and our great Australian parliament is built on these conventions. The main convention that was breached by secret ministerial appointments was that of accountability. This convention means that the ministerial decision-makers in the executive government are responsible to the parliament and the parliament is responsible to voters. As Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue KC explained:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Plainly enough, it is impossible for the parliament to hold ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Bell, from the inquiry into the matter, explained:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given that the Parliament was not informed of any of the appointments, it was unable to hold Mr Morrison to account in his capacity as minister administering any of these five departments—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not one, not two, not three but five—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Solicitor-General concluded, the principles of responsible government were "fundamentally undermined" because Mr Morrison was not "responsible" to the Parliament, and through the Parliament to the electors, for the departments he was appointed to administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conventions of responsible government are a fundamental pillar of our proud Australian democracy. They are required to maintain the public's faith in our political constitution. This bill, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, is essential to restoring our faith in democracy and upholding the conventions necessary for responsible government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the trends identified in the 2022 CSIRO report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Our future world: global megatrends impacting the way we live over coming decades</span>, was that societies are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability. This underpins trust in governments, trust in science, trust in organisations. What we have seen in this decade is a decay in trust. There have been events such as 6 January 2021, the storming of the US Capitol. This occurred because of the inability of a leader to accept the limits of their power and to be accountable to the people. Then we had the 8 January 2023 storming of the Brazilian Congress, which was born out of the lack of trust in the democratic institutions in Brazil and their ability to deliver a peaceful transition of power. In my home electorate of Swan, one of my Australian-Brazilian constituents was shaken to the core by what was happening here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our democracy is precious. I am so proud that we are a part of a democratic nation, but it is fragile, and we need to strengthen it. This is something that's worth fighting for, and this is something that the public wants. Maintaining the trust of the people is so important to make sure that we prevent things such as violent backslides. Whilst we might not have those conditions here, we should always be working to improve the health of our democracy and to strengthen the conventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speeches, sometimes we look at literary references. I think it's unfair to judge people in this place based on the way that they look. Aesthetics are based on your genetics. What I am interested in is character, because character is something that you have the ability to work on, to improve. Following literary references, what the member for Cook did as Prime Minister reminds me a little bit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lord </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Rings</span> character Gollum. What Gollum wanted to do with the ring was extend his power and life beyond the realm of the ordinary. That's what Gollum was interested in. He was fascinated by this symbol. He wanted the power. He wanted to extend this power beyond his actual natural capabilities—and that's what we saw in this place. You know what? If people had known the truth, they would have been disgusted and they would have seen the true essence of what it was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the member for Cook did as Prime Minister, in secretly assuming five ministries, was well beyond the ordinary and was a total defiance of the conventions of our parliamentary systems. I remember in my former workplace we changed some of the reporting of a particular thing, and I looked to my boss and said, 'I want rules and I want to know how to interpret them.' My boss said to me: 'I don't want to write rules, because I want you to use principles. I want you to orientate your decisions based on the principles.' That is what the Westminster system was based on. It was based on principles. It was based on this fundamental understanding that the people who are elected to this place have principles. What did we see? We saw a government and a leader that didn't represent that. Even though we didn't know this when we were doorknocking during my election campaign in Swan—we knocked on 45,000 doors—people could smell it. People could see it. They knew it. I would talk to people, and they would have the sense of: 'You know what? I just don't trust our Prime Minister. I just don't trust it.' And that smell could be smelt from across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not wanting to be held to account was a theme of the previous Prime Minister. I remember having a radio interview with Liam Bartlett, and I said that there are these characteristics of the member for Cook, which are that he's a liar and a bully. He said, 'But you're saying that from your side of politics.' And I was like: 'No. Let's have a look at the conservative side, and let me give you this long list of conservative people that are pretty grumpy about the character of this person.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, from a WA perspective, the former prime minister's support of Clive Palmer's case against WA's hard borders, which saved lives, was fascinating. This was pushed in question time by the then opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, followed by the member for Whitlam. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw his minimised role in the robodebt saga. Despite being its creator, he passed the buck onto the department and his colleagues. Morrison, in December 2022, in the royal commission, said that legal advice warning that the scheme was unlawful was not raised directly with the ministers until late 2019, when the program was eventually shut down. That was when he left the country during the Black Saturday bushfires and sought to deflect criticism by saying, 'Don't hold a hose!' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we had the vaccine rollout face delays, the member for Cook stated, 'It's not a race,' rather than acknowledge that it was a failure of his government to ensure that we had secured enough vaccines for our nation. Then, with the 'bully' and 'liar' and 'not a team player' vibes, we had the Liberal senator for New South Wales Concetta Fierravanti-Wells say Morrison is 'an autocrat' and 'a bully who has no moral compass' and 'The fish stinks from the head.' I think that's what people could smell in the heart of Swan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former deputy prime minister and member for New England said: 'He is a hypocrite and a liar, from my observations, and that is over a long time. I have never trusted him and I dislike how he earnestly rearranges the truth to a lie.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have former Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate and the way her dismissal was handled, which she explained as 'one of the worst acts of bullying I have ever witnessed'. The member for Cook said that she needs to go. What did she do? She kept post offices open during a pandemic. She kept banking options available to regional Australians. As a girl born and bred in the Goldfields who loved going to the post office, and sitting up on the bench and seeing the wet roly thing that you put the stamps on, I love our post offices! They are the heart of regional towns and this is something that's fundamentally important. The truth is, Christine Holgate is seen as an amazing female business leader. And what did this government do? </span>

                    </a>  It's about the outcomes and who is responsible for the outcomes. It's about the government of the day. Isn't it ironic, the member for McPherson saying that he needs to resign and leave parliament!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former New South Wales Liberal premier Gladys Berejiklian described the member for Cook as 'a horrible, horrible person' and bemoaned that he was 'more concerned with politics than people'. Then we have French President Emmanuel Macron, who said, when asked whether the member for Cook had lied to him, 'I don't think, I know.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He doesn't hold a hose, he doesn't order enough vaccinations and he says, 'It's not my job.' The thing that's hilarious is that during the election campaign we had these corflute signs that said, 'Not my job!' They were splattered throughout Western Australia. But the thing that's ironic is he had five extra jobs that we didn't know about. How is the Australian public to know? I think the irony of that is amusing—except for the fact that this is our democracy. This is a really special place to be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would remind people that when we had the censure moment in the House and the member for Cook's colleagues—what was interesting for me, as I watched in this place, is that everyone, after the censure moment, lined up to shake the hand of this man, after this really monumental moment in this parliament. There was this line of support which, to me, was the symbolism of condoning the behaviours of our previous prime minister. I want to see an improvement in our parliament, and this is the reason that we have this bill, but I think that the other side need to reflect on their behaviours and reflect on what renewal looks like. If you continue to do what you're doing and get stuck in the past, you're not going to see where the rest of Australia is going. The support was amusing, and I think it's something that we need to recognise. The seventh edition of the<span style="font-style:italic;"> House of Representatives Practice</span> says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A censure motion, as the words imply, expresses more a disapproval or reprimand at particular actions or policies of the Government …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A former Prime Minister being censured in the House of Representatives for the first time is historically significant. There was one exception. I remember looking across the chamber during that time, and there was one member I saw who, to me, looked like she had the weight of the whole other side of the House on her shoulders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Swan, time and time again people have been telling me that the minimum requirement for being a member of parliament is integrity, principles. I think it's extraordinary that we have this bill where we need to actually look at this. Under the previous Liberal government, there were no actions on a national anticorruption commission. There was not a draft bill. Legislation was not introduced to the House. They were asleep at the wheel. The substance of this bill is making sure that we have a parliament that we can trust, a democracy that we can believe in and a democracy that we can have for future generations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 is only before us because of the extraordinary steps that were taken by the former Prime Minister the member for Cook, who, between March 2020 and May 2021, was appointed by the Governor-General to administer not only his own Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but an additional five portfolios of the executive. He made himself the secret Minister for Health, the secret Minister for Finance, the secret Treasurer, the secret Minister for Home Affairs and the secret Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. In almost all cases, the gazetted portfolio minister was completely unaware of their understudy. But, even as late as last week, details of this deception were still being discovered, with the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Guardian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Australia reporting that the former member for Tangney Ben Morton and the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, were appointed to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Home Affairs. As the member for Swan has pointed out, the member for McPherson summed it up best in her interview with Sky News last Thursday. The member for McPherson said: 'It's not okay to behave in the way the former Prime Minister and others have in relation to keeping information secret.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is only the most recent chapter in this tale of deception. On 22 August 2022 the Solicitor-General's advice was publicly released, noting that the principles of responsible government were fundamentally undermined by the actions of the member for Cook. This finding directly challenged the coalition's response to the news about the then Prime Minister's action. They argued it wasn't against the law—a desperately narrow observation and one which shows little respect for the Australian parliament and the Australian people. The Solicitor-General's finding was repeated by the Bell inquiry, which observed that the principles of responsible government were fundamentally undermined. As a brief aside, can you imagine watching an episode of<span style="font-style:italic;"> Yes</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Prime Minister</span> where Jim Hacker secretly takes on five extra ministries? We would have laughed and laughed and probably thought that, even for this show, they were stretching it a bit too far. But, in reality, these actions were the quintessence of how the Morrison government operated, with a command-and-control structure which inevitably led to mess and mismanagement. So much for cabinet government!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' mess and mismanagement is the culmination of a decade of inaction. No matter where you looked, you would find evidence of their mess and mismanagement. For example, when Labor was first elected in May 2022 there were one million backlogged visas; that's one million people who were awaiting a decision that they could come to or stay in this country, build a family here, visit their loved ones or bring much-needed skills to Australia. That's one million people the previous government was unable to help or was simply uninterested in helping. By the end of 2022 our Labor government had processed over four million visas since the election. That meant Australians were reconnected with loved ones before Christmas. And we were addressing the skills shortages the previous government left us and our economy. Despite hiring 400 staff to process applications, there is still work to be done in processing just under 600,000 visa applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is also working to clear the backlog of NDIS cases that was left by the previous government, who were too preoccupied with their harsh, unfair and illegal robodebt scheme. The government has established alternate dispute resolution processes to address NDIS appeals, resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The latest numbers regarding the AAT backlog show that 4,401 NDIS cases have been resolved at the AAT since 1 June 2022—a 27 per cent reduction in overall caseload since May 2022, and 70 per cent of the 4,501 legacy cases active in May 2022 have now been resolved. I have seen the impact of this in my own electorate of Cunningham, where, with the support of the minister, my office has been able to bring resolution to the logjam of cases left by the former government. These are more than just statistics; these are brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, husbands and wives who need support to live fulfilling and meaningful lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government has turned to Australia's leading disability advocates and policy experts to help turn the tide on NDIA culture—including former Australian of the Year and Paralympic legend Kurt Fearnley AO, who is now chairing the NDIA board. Only now, in 2023, because of this government's decisions, are there five people with disability on the NDIA board—the largest number in the NDIA's history. Having people with disability feeling as though they are forced to fight for a moderate support package makes no sense. I, like the minister, acknowledge there is still more work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' mess and mismanagement also saw the Australian energy grid and energy users come under increasing pressures. Only the Albanese Labor government is making the investments that should have been made a long time ago—including in my community, where we have invested more than $1 million in a University of Wollongong study finding ways to keep Australia's grid secure through the renewable energy transformation. We are investing $10 million to establish the Energy Futures Skills Centre, located at the University of Wollongong, so we have the skilled workforce to build the grid of the future; $2.5 million for a renewable energy training centre at the Wollongong TAFE—I acknowledge my colleague the minister for skills and vocational education—which will include upgrades to equipment and teaching aids; $9 million to Hysata to develop and deliver new low-cost hydrogen in Port Kembla; and 400 community batteries to store excess energy from rooftop solar generation, like the one in Warrawong in my electorate, which is one of the lowest socio-economic areas. And we are listing the Illawarra as one of the first six proposed sites for offshore wind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this is in addition to the New Energy Apprenticeships Program, which will support Australians to train for the jobs of future and help power Australia's path to net zero emissions. Apprentices training in eligible occupations in the clean energy sector can now attract up to $10,000 in direct support, helping them to manage the cost of living while they train in sectors that are essential to Australia's transition to a clean energy economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the mess and mismanagement of the former government, this side of the chamber is getting on with the job of fixing the problems by investing in the skills that are needed for our future prosperity. The bill that is before us shows the government is delivering on its promises to the Australian people, promises that were made to restore trust and integrity to federal politics.</span>

                    </a>  I don't know how you can argue against trust and integrity, but anyway. These include the recent introduction of legislation for a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission, one which the opposition failed to introduce. These measures will go some way to providing greater integrity and transparency around the processes of appointing elected officials to high office not only in this government but in governments of the future. This parliament has a responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of accountability, checks and balances and strong parliamentary oversight of executive government. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Throughout the world, orderly societies function on acceptance of standards of behaviour, standards of behaviour that often evolve over time—over centuries—taking into account cultural values and general principles of common decency and respect for others. Many of those standards have over time become enshrined in law. Others simply become entrenched in culture and carry on from one era to the next. In Australia's case many of our standards and our values arise from our foundation constitution. We find within that the very values and laws which so much of our society is built on. This very parliament is part of those laws and those values, and this very parliament is guided by House practice, previously modelled on the UK House of Commons practice but, since 1981, from the Australian parliamentary practice. It has been entrenched in practice since Federation in 1901—and probably prior to that in the British parliament, upon which the Westminster system of government is modelled—that all ministerial and parliamentary appointments are immediately notified to parliament. The Westminster system of government and of parliament is frequently held up as a leading model of democratic parliamentary process, embracing transparency and accountability of government. Transparency and accountability are critical to public confidence in parliament and in government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very reason this legislation, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, is before parliament is that former prime minister Morrison, the member for Cook, trashed centuries of tradition. In doing so, he trashed that structure of society here in Australia, trashed our Constitution and, quite frankly, trashed our democracy. He did that by failing to publicly disclose that during his last term in office, between March 2020 and May 2021, he had appointed himself to five ministerial portfolios without notifying this parliament, let alone the Australian people. It was only in mid-August 2022 that this information about the former prime minister's five ministerial appointments became public knowledge—that is, 2½ years after the events began and three months after the federal election in May 2022. It was, to my knowledge, the most disrespectful treatment of parliament and the Australian people by a prime minister since Federation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of it all is that, because of the extraordinary powers held by the Prime Minister under the Westminster system, none of the former prime minister's actions were necessary. By convention, the Prime Minister can at any time override or replace a minister in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, and contrary to former prime minister Morrison's feeble response, there was no emergency which necessitated the unprecedented action which we saw him undertake. If the then Prime Minister believed he was acting in the national interest, why did he not disclose his actions to the Australian parliament, to the Australian people or even to his own party room? Surely, if there was unprecedented action required and it was in the national interest, the argument could have been well made at that time by the former Prime Minister. But he didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That then raises the obvious question: just why did he appoint himself, and find it necessary to appoint himself, to all of those different ministerial portfolios? He appointed himself as Minister for Health, Minister for Finance, Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Minister for Home Affairs and Treasurer. Is it because he had lost confidence in his ministers but was too afraid to replace them because they might, in turn, turn on him and he might be voted out of office, or was he obsessed with power? I guess we'll never really know. We can make assumptions about what the reason was. Nevertheless, it really raises the question: why did he act in the way he did when the truth is that he didn't need to? Whatever the reason, the lack of transparency and the underlying dishonesty of not disclosing his actions further eroded trust and confidence in parliament and in politicians more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that we have before us now prescribes transparency, prevents a reoccurrence of the member for Cook's actions and re-establishes some trust in the parliament. The truth of the matter is that this legislation should never have been necessary, because parliamentarians—starting from the very highest office in this land, that of the Prime Minister—should have acted with honesty and integrity. Had that happened, not only would the Australian people have continued to have at least some level of confidence and trust in this parliament but we would not today be having to try to legislate for that trust rather than have it because people acted in accordance with the expectations of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, real trust and confidence are best assured when those in positions of authority voluntarily act honourably and with integrity. That's when you get real trust and confidence throughout the land. That wasn't the case in the last government, and perhaps it was a reflection of a failed government that for its whole term in office was riddled with acts which caused a loss of confidence in this parliament among the Australian people. This was a government that failed to enact a national anticorruption commission. In hindsight, it's quite clear that the Morrison government didn't want a national anticorruption commission because that commission would then very likely have had the power to investigate actions of the very government that established the national anticorruption commission, and that was the last thing they wanted. They could not bring in a national anticorruption commission that was not independent of government, and, once it was not independent of government, the former Prime Minister saw some problems with that body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the government that pursued the illegal robodebt scheme which we're hearing so much about right now—again a matter that the Morrison government did not want exposed and inquired into. As we're seeing right now, we understand why and we understand how detrimental to the lives of so many people that illegal action was. This was a government that stacked the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal with 85 politically aligned appointments—appointments made simply to carry out the agenda of the government of the day and not make the impartial decisions that one would expect of that body. This was a government that rorted grant funds in a way that I have not seen before. There are many, many examples of that that people can talk about and analyse. The reality is that this was a government that did that each and every time funds were made available for a particular program. This was a government that paid $30 million for land valued, at best, at $3 million. Yet they've never explained why and how they came to that value. I hope there are going to be more explanations about all of that. This was a government that refused to disclose the $1 million of funding to the former Attorney-General and that also cut funding to the only other office we had in the land that might have been able to inquire into government operations, and that was the Auditor General 's office. I could go on about all of those matters that the Morrison government oversaw in its time in office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that the Morrison government was a government in office at a time when there were many matters before this parliament that the Australian people were asking questions about. The last thing that the government wanted was to be held accountable. So it turned out that, rather than the Prime Minister of the day setting up the bodies and ensuring transparency, he did the exact opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to finish my comments with this perspective. As I said from the outset, we live in a structured society. We live in a country that is considered one of the most democratic in the world. Consider this. Had the Prime Minister, instead of taking on the responsibilities of five ministers, taken on the responsibility of each and every minister in the cabinet—which he could have done in exactly the same way that he took on the responsibility of those five—there was nothing stopping him from going all the way and replacing every single cabinet minister with himself. What sort of country would we have had then? Yet the system allowed him to do so and he took advantage of it for his own personal reasons. That is the seriousness of what he actually did. It would have effectively made him a dictator. It wasn't just five portfolios. That simply highlights what could have been possible under that scenario.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to members opposite that this legislation is before the House because we don't want to see a repeat of that. It's before the House to try and restore the confidence that the Australian people, I believe, have for almost a century had in the parliament. It's before the House because we want this parliament to operate with transparency and integrity. Quite frankly, it had done so for nearly a century, and all of those traditions and all of that confidence were lost because of the action of one single person, the former member for Cook, the Prime Minister at the time. I commend this legislation to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 is an extremely important piece of legislation, but it's also an extremely important broader topic, because there are few things more important than the integrity of government and government processes and the way in which that is perceived by the broader community. So I'm going to spend a bit of time today talking about the arrangements that the former Prime Minister put in place but I'm also going to talk about the fact that these arrangements were emblematic of a broader pattern of stretching and bending rules, of acting in a way that undermined confidence in some of our key conventions and patterns of behaviour. This is something that is of first-order importance and that we, as a government elected just 10 months ago, are right in wanting to correct, because the behaviour of the previous government undermined institutions that were already suffering from challenges in public perception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANU's Australian Election Study found that Australian's satisfaction with democracy in 2019 was at its lowest level since the of the 1970s. Indeed, it had fallen in a little over a decade. Fifty-nine per cent of Australians were satisfied with democracy. This is 27 percentage points below the level that it had been at in 2007. I contend—I think, with very good reason—that the behaviour of the former Prime Minister when it came to secretly appointing himself to multiple portfolios and the behaviour of the previous government in stretching the rules when it came to allocating funds were material contributors to that broad trend. It's absolutely critical that this parliament, in a cross-partisan way, embrace a different way forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament has done so—or at least parts of this parliament have done so—in a range of ways, including by passing legislation in relation to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Passing this bill will be a further step. But it's also important that we change the culture—the culture of the way in which ministers are held accountable in this place, the culture of the way in which ministers interact with government departments and the culture with which we appropriate funds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the Bell report and its findings in relation to the way in which the previous Prime Minister, the member for Cook, was appointed to a number of portfolios. Going to the Solicitor-General's opinion, cited in the report, I quote paragraph 29:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While I consider that Mr Morrison's appointment to administer DISER was valid—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">technically valid, in a legalistic sense—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">that is not to say that the absence of any notification of that appointment to the Parliament, the public, the other Ministers … was consistent with the principle of responsible government that is inherent in Ch II of the Constitution. In my opinion, it was not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, 'in my opinion' it was not consistent with the fundamental principles of responsible government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's worth referring to High Court statements on responsible government in other contexts. The High Court, in an earlier judgement, said that responsible government is a system by which the executive is responsible to the legislature and, through it, to the electorate. It is one of the most fundamental aspects of the Westminster system, where the executive is within parliament and the executive is answerable to parliament, in many forums, including question time, Senate estimates and many other forums. That is a fundamental tenet of how ministers, the executive and the Prime Minister are held accountable to this place, but also, even more importantly, to the electorate. The High Court has also said on previous occasions that responsible government is a fundamental, central feature of the Australian constitutional system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to another aspect of the Solicitor-General's opinion, and it is, in a sense, a more practical observation, which was made at paragraph 32:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Plainly enough, it is impossible for the Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where this all leads to. At the most fundamental level of question time, who can know who should be asked about what if you don't even know who's holding which portfolios? If multiple ministers are holding the same portfolio, who's going to make the decision? We saw in at least one instance, the Prime Minister making a decision himself, overriding a minister. Who's to say that wasn't to occur in all sorts of other contexts, and, potentially, who's to say that that kind of overriding wasn't to occur in a way that wasn't particularly transparent? It fundamentally undermines question time in a very practical way. But, as I said before, question time is but one of the ways in which the executive is held to account. I would argue that it undermines all of those different mechanisms. Which minister should turn up to Senate estimates? It is a fundamental undermining of the core of our very system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to some of the practices that have arisen as a part of responsible government. There is the publication of ministerial appointments in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span>, and ministerial lists are published in parliament. One can go to these various mechanisms and argue whether or not they're strictly required, but to me that's not the point. To me the point is all of these different aspects of accountability and transparency are a reflection of how important responsible government is, and how responsible government can only be implemented in a way that is meaningful if it's done in a way that is transparent in a practical way. That kind of behaviour on that side of the House, and I hope across this parliament as a whole, should not be permitted again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect of this broader issue of integrity in government is the National Anti-Corruption Commission. I go to that because this was such a major topic of discussion in the previous term of government. The previous government was elected on a promise of implementing, of legislating a national anticorruption commission. We prioritised that in our first 10 months, amongst other important policy areas that needed remedying. The previous government promised to pass legislation to implement a national anticorruption commission. What we found ourselves with at the end of the last term was this ridiculous situation where a piece of legislation was in the public realm, but the government refused to bring it into this place because they claimed they didn't like the signals they were getting from the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was one of the more bizarre instances that I've ever seen of a government clearly breaching a commitment. They had the legislation. The legislation had taken much longer to draft and there had been much less consultation than was ideal, but the government had gotten around to having a draft piece of legislation. But there was this bizarre situation where they refused to bring it into this place. I have never seen something so unusual. What the previous government tried to do was to somehow blame everybody else in the chamber for that. They didn't like the fact that we wouldn't give a commitment for its carte blanche passage, that we said we wanted to have a look at it because we said we may disagree with parts of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the model the previous government, now opposition, put forward. The Centre for Public Integrity labelled it the 'weakest integrity commission in the country' after comparing it with a range of state and territory watchdogs. The former Victorian Court of Appeal judge Stephen Charles labelled it 'a fraud'. The former New South Wales Supreme Court judge Anthony Whealy said the coalition's model was 'a farce' because it wouldn't be able to scrutinise and investigate corrupt conduct by politicians, ministers, their staff or two-thirds of the Public Service. We had a flawed model that wasn't even brought into this place, and that was another key element of why integrity was so seriously undermined in the previous term of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have remedied that particular aspect of what had gone on in the previous three years—or one could say the previous nine years—of inaction. We have brought forward legislation and passed it, and none too soon. It's important to note that we find ourselves where we are, with a community that is sceptical of a lot of what goes on in the political realm, in part because of what the previous government did with such an important piece of infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the way in which taxpayers funds were allocated in a range of contexts by the previous government. Now this is referred to as rorts, and in many instances it went above and beyond what people could consider reasonable. But at the heart of this problem is that people lose faith in the way in which government allocates funds if governments don't do it in a way that involves good faith, that involves rigour and that involves transparency. As a parliament, as an executive a government, what we need to constantly remind ourselves is that it is important that we constantly retain the trust of the people, that it is such a precious thing and such a fragile thing. In so many instances those opposite pushed the boundaries in a cynical way, in such a way it didn't pass the pub test. Again, we can get into debating legalities, we can get into debating all the different aspects of it in an administrative sense, but so much of it just seemed unreasonable and politically cynical that I believe it was also a major contributor to the public's declining faith in our most important institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the $4.8 billion Urban Congestion Fund, in which 83 per cent of projects went to Liberal-held seats. There was, of course, the $660 million Commuter Car Park Fund, so many projects of which seemed to materialise in marginal seats at the last moment without rigorous analysis. Not one of the 47 car park sites promised by the coalition at the 2019 election was selected by the infrastructure department. These are just basic things that they were getting wrong—well, I suppose the word 'wrong' may not be the appropriate word. It depends on what your frame is. 'Inappropriate' is probably the best word there. There was, of course, the rorting of projects under the sports program. Nearly three-quarters, 73 per cent, of the projects that then sports minister Bridget McKenzie approved were not recommended by Sports Australia. Of course, there were the multicoloured spreadsheets, which, for anybody in the community with any familiarity with Excel or anything to do with the most basic IT, would set off alarm bells. This is the kind of example of government administration that makes people cynical. In both cases, we see not just a skewness in the allocation of funds but decisions being made either against or without any reference to departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the Community Development Grants Program, $1.7 billion, distributed between 2013 and 2021. Safe Labor seats received $22 a head; marginal coalition seats and safe coalition seats received $202 a head; and marginal seats received $84 a head. Again, the optics of this are terrible, and those opposite were not able to demonstrate to us at any point in the last term a process that was transparent or rigorous where these projects had been allocated according to some kind of process of working it through with experts. Of course, this was the program to fund female change rooms and pools in remote areas of the country. As was noted so often in this place—and it became almost an icon of poorly appropriated funds—the North Sydney Olympic Pool somehow managed to squeeze itself in this very low-socioeconomic regional area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and on about this, but there are a number of major concerns. One is the sheer quantum. If you add up all these funds, we're talking billions of dollars. The second is the skewness. The third is the total lack of rigour. Of course people's alarm bells are going to ring when they're seeing Excel sheets and no reference to departments or departments being overridden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The immediate thing we're debating here today is a very important piece of legislation to remedy a breach in practice that I believe was completely unnecessary and egregious. It's a reflection of a previous government that acted in that manner in so many other ways—in delaying the national anticorruption commission and in the way it allocated funds. This bill is very important, and it's critical that this government continues to build on integrity in government to improve the way in which government operates for the sake of all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  The introduction of this bill, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, reflects the Albanese government's solid commitment to restoring trust in federal government and restoring integrity to parliament. It follows a shameful decade under the Liberal government, where harmful and destructive decisions destroyed lives and damaged trust in government. If left to fester, the Liberals' past performance could fundamentally undermine our democracy. But now the grown-ups are back in charge, and we are fixing the Liberals' mess.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first address to the House, I spoke of the power of government to help people, to give everyone the ability to strive and succeed. I said, 'I entered politics mostly because of my beautiful daughters, Lily and Isobel,' and I declared that my greatest wish for them would be that they grow up bearing witness to a fair and just future for our country. This bill will enable that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, it addresses the former Liberal Prime Minister the member for Cook's secret appointment to administer several ministerial portfolios, in addition to his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The ministries the former Prime Minister adopted for himself included health; finance; industry, science, energy and resources; Treasury; and home affairs. Of course, there have been some recent revelations of new areas that other ministers were appointed to administer without colleagues being aware of it. It is just astounding this happened without cabinet and the member for Cook's colleagues being aware of it and certainly without the parliament, this House or, most importantly, the Australian people being aware of it. It reflects the seriousness of these actions in undermining our system of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advice of the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC, were made public on 22 August last year. It noted that the principles of responsible government were undermined by the actions of the former Prime Minister. This led to the Bell inquiry and, importantly, recommendations contained in this bill to ensure that no such secretive or damaging actions by a prime minister, or any minister, can occur again. We've accepted these recommendations, because the Albanese government knows that high standards in parliament matter—high standards that demonstrate respect for parliamentary conventions like accountability, integrity and transparent decision-making. These conventions underpin our democracy, but under the previous Liberal government rules were broken, transparency in decision-making was ignored and democracy was challenged. It is time to fix the damage done after a decade of Liberal mismanagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill requires that the Official Secretary to the Governor-General publish a notifiable instrument on the Federal Register of Legislation as soon as reasonably practicable in the following circumstances: when the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council, appointed an officer to administer a department of state or directed a minister of state to hold an office. Further, the bill will require notification on the revocation of any of these positions to be published. These measures will ensure transparency and accountability in the appointment and revocation of ministerial portfolios by making these changes public knowledge as soon as possible. We need that public knowledge. We want to prevent a repeat of the secret appointments that occurred in the past. Without this transparency. it's impossible for the parliament to hold individuals accountable for their actions. Moreover, this bill reinforces the importance of the trust among ministers and in the Westminster system's conventions. The sad and sorry chapter of Australian history that we witnessed should never be repeated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a rapid response to the findings of the Bell inquiry. By requiring public disclosure of ministerial appointment changes and revocations, this bill will demonstrate a truly transparent parliament and bolster public trust in our democratic system. It has been sorely tested, and we need to ensure that the public have faith in their parliament and in their government. It is crucial that we implement every measure to maintain integrity in our institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that even the former Prime Minister's colleagues have questioned the member for Cook's actions and motivations and their capacity to undermine our democratic system. As many of my trusted colleagues have already highlighted, former prime ministers have weighed in on this matter. Former Prime Minister John Howard said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think he should have done that, I don't think there was any need to do it, and I wouldn't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott acknowledged the unconventional nature of the situation, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm just not going to defend what was done. It is just highly unconventional , highly unorthodox and shouldn't have happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull went even further, describing the situation as 'sinister stuff' and 'one of the most appalling things I've ever heard in our federal government'. Turnbull added:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I mean, the idea that a Prime Minister would be sworn in to other ministries secretly is incredible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These quotes from former prime ministers demonstrate the gravity of the situation and the impact it has had on our democracy. The actions of the former Prime Minister were extraordinary and concerning, and it's deeply disappointing that we must work to prevent such abuses of power from happening in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will achieve this, alongside establishment of the powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission as the centrepiece. Additionally, we have followed through on our election promise and established a royal commission into the Liberal government's illegal and callous robodebt scheme, which hounded vulnerable people for debts they did not have. It resulted in unnecessary anguish, anxiety and, in some very tragic circumstances, suicide. Passing this legislation will be a step forward, righting the wrongs of the member for Cook and ensuring that no future prime minister will repeat the actions of the former prime minister. It is a sad day when we must legislate to enforce conventions that should be fundamental to our parliamentarians who are elected to this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Respect for our democracy and the Australian people should be the driving force behind our actions. None of us should ever seek to undermine those conventions, nor should we attempt to manipulate the system for our own benefit. The opposition's support of this change is an important acknowledgement of that fact. While I do not take pleasure in revisiting this issue—the disregard shown by the former Prime Minister towards his role and responsibilities—it's crucial that we take steps to ensure accountability and transparency in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to upholding these values and I am proud to support this legislation. This legislation represents an important step towards restoring the public's trust in our democracy and holding those in power accountable. Let us remember that we are here to serve the Australian people, not ourselves or our own ambitions. Let us uphold the conventions and principles of our democracy and let us ensure that no prime minister can ever undermine them again. The Australian people deserve nothing less. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  This Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 seeks to implement the first recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Inquiry into the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Appointment of the Former Prime Minister</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">to Administer Multiple Departments</span> by Virginia Bell AC. That first recommendation requires the publication in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</span> of appointments to administer departments, directions to a minister of state to hold an office, the swearing in of an executive councillor or the revocation of any of these appointments. This is only the first of six recommendations from the Bell report, and it's worth recalling the conduct of the former Prime Minister that led to this point. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Bell's report found that the member for Cook had been appointed to administer six of the 14 departments of state. None of these appointments were disclosed to the parliament or the public, and, in several cases, the minister who was responsible for the portfolio wasn't even told. Ms Bell described the member for Cook's explanations of these appointments as 'not easy to understand', which puts it charitably. She noted that the appointments were not necessary, as an acting minister could have been appointed in a matter of minutes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The appointments to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, the Department of Home Affairs and Treasury had, in the words of Ms Bell, 'little connection to the pandemic'. They were, instead, made because the member for Cook was concerned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the incumbent minister might exercise his or her statutory powers in a manner with which Mr Morrison—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the member for Cook—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">did not agree.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the member for Cook's appointment to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources appears to have been made directly so that he could overturn the then minister, the member for Hinkler, Keith Pitt's decision to approve an offshore gas project. Just last month, the Federal Court overturned the member for Cook's decision due to questions about the member for Cook's impartiality in making the decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Bell stated the conduct of the member for Cook had 'fundamentally undermined the principles of government'. She also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the lack of disclosure of the appointments to the public was apt to undermine public confidence in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the secrecy with which they had been surrounded was corrosive of trust in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Solicitor-General, Stephen Donaghue KC, stated in his advice that Mr Morrison's appointments were:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… inconsistent with the conventions and practices that form an essential part of the system of responsible government prescribed by Ch II of the Constitution. That is because it is impossible for Parliament and the public to hold Ministers accountable for the proper administration of particular departments if the identity of the Ministers who have been appointed to administer those departments is not publicised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see this every sitting day in question time, when the Speaker calls a minister to answer a question. And yet in question time under the former government, the former prime minister could well have popped up and said, 'Well, as it happens, I am also the Treasurer, I'm also the resources minister.' This would have been extraordinary, but it was the state of affairs that prevailed under the Liberals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week we learned that the appointments went beyond the member for Cook. Ben Morton was appointed to administer the Home Affairs Department and the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, was appointed to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. While those appointments were gazetted, the member for Cook specifically requested there be no swearing-in ceremony, no public events, no changes to official ministerial lists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction from the general public has been one of shock and outrage, but so, too, has been the reaction from fellow Liberal Party colleagues. Josh Frydenberg described these appointments as 'extreme overreach'. That's the reaction he gets from his Lodge flatmate. Another one of the former prime minister's flatmates, the member for Fadden, Stuart Robert, described the appointments as 'nuts'. Those are the character references he gets from his flatmates. The member for McPherson, Karen Andrews, said, 'To be honest, I feel the Australian people were betrayed.' She has asked the member for Cook to stand down from parliament as a result of this affair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler, Keith Pitt, detailed his reactions in Niki Savva's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Bulldozed</span>. He said that after being told in June 2021 that the member for Cook had sworn himself in as resources minister to block the PEP-11 project, the member for Hinkler considered releasing a statement unilaterally approving the project. He also considered resigning. He ultimately did neither, but only to avoid plunging the government into further crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Malcolm Turnbull, a former prime minister and the member for Cook's predecessor. He has described the multiple ministries scandal as 'sinister' and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… one of the most appalling things I have ever heard in our Federal Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say that the most troubling thing about the saga was 'why the rest of the system went along with it. That's a thing I find most troubling.' Mr Turnbull is right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would mitigate a similar scenario in the future by ensuring that such decisions were made public. It is a bill that we hope the opposition will support, but that is despite the fact that the opposition leader has described the Bell inquiry as 'a witch-hunt'. It is extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition would downplay the Bell inquiry, an inquiry that was conducted by a former High Court Judge, an inquiry which went to a scandal that has rocked Australians and rocked many former Liberals. The member for Cook's actions in these secret ministries were just one of the many ways in which the Liberals damaged our democracy. We saw my own charities portfolio, harm minimisation and environmental charities, including the Grace Tame Foundation, unable to get deductible gift recipient status because the Morrison government disagreed with their political stance. We saw the gagging of organisations that wanted to speak out, from the community legal centres to overseas aid organisations to antipoverty groups. We saw the promise of a national integrity commission before the 2019 election, yet never delivered in the 2019 to 2022 term. We saw the sports rorts scandal, the land grants scandal, the stacking of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw, under the former Liberal government, cuts to a range of important government programs, ranging from the ABC to the Audit Office itself. When the Audit Office discovered substantial improprieties, such as the fact that the former government had paid 10 times too much for land for the new Sydney airport, the former government's approach was to cut $14 million from the Audit Office. We saw contracts given out to entities that were manifestly unable to handle then. We saw money going to entities, such as the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, that were clearly not capable of managing the significant government contracts to which they were being allocated. We saw the ultimate resignation of the sports minister for the sports rorts scandal and the failure of the member for Cook to take responsibility for this failure in public administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians look back at the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments and shake their heads at the way in which these governments mismanaged public finances. During the pandemic we saw almost $20 billion of taxpayer money going to firms with rising revenue. The JobKeeper payment was necessary in order to save jobs, but we didn't save jobs by giving $20 billion to firms whose revenues were going up, rather than down. Firms from Harvey Norman to AP Eagers received taxpayer money under the JobKeeper program, a waste which ultimately amounted to some $2,000 for every Australian household. No-one in this parliament denies that JobKeeper was an important program, but what Australians were so frustrated by was the mismanagement of our public finances that saw $2,000 per Australian household go to firms whose revenues were going up, rather than down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important bill which deals with one of the shocking scandals that occurred during the Liberals' time in office. It is probably one of those scandals that will serve as an example in public administration classes for years to come. When Australian students are looking at some of the worst moments of public maladministration in Australian history, they will look back at the multiple ministries scandal as an example of one of the incidents that really characterise the way the member for Cook and his colleagues saw public administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, these are weighty matters, but it did seem appropriate to add a little levity to the proceedings. So I asked ChatGPT if it could provide me with a moment of light-hearted humour to encapsulate the multiple ministries scandal. It suggested the following, which I will conclude with: 'Apparently Scott Morrison was secretly sworn in as minister for time travel. It's the only way he could've been in Hawaii and Canberra at the same time.'</span>

It was that feeling of incredulity that we had so frequently in opposition at the disfunction and the extraordinary situation that the previous Morrison government put this country into, the trashing of long-standing norms of responsible government, of good governance. Turning up to work some days you couldn't believe the kinds of things that were happening in the previous Morrison government. The multiple ministry scandal—even saying it out loud is an extraordinary thing—was probably the nadir of this. You cannot get a better encapsulation of what a megalomaniacal weirdo the member for Cook was as Prime Minister, and the damage and harm that his saviour complex did to the institutions of Westminster government in our country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 demonstrates the Albanese government is delivering on its promise to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials. The bill will implement reforms to provide for greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration. I saw a tweet this morning from the Manager of Opposition Business complaining this bill was just 'an administrative bill about Ministers' and that it wasn't worth the time of the parliament. It really shows that those opposite have learned nothing from their chaotic time in government and have learned nothing about the costs of their maladministration and chaos to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about the most fundamental responsibility of all of us in this chamber—the basic functioning of responsible government. When responsible government is trashed, the quality of government suffers. Our democracy suffers. Our national interest suffers. It is crucial the Albanese government acts to rectify the reckless trashing of these institutions by the previous government. The purpose of this bill is to implement the first of the six recommendations of the Bell inquiry. It follows the steps the government has taken to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anticorruption commission—the need for which became, unfortunately, obvious under the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has spoken about the importance of respecting parliament and its role. I know that he takes the obligations of his office incredibly seriously. That's why the recent censure of the member for Cook for his trashing of Westminster institutions and responsible government was so important. The fact that that censure was necessary was, for me, a profoundly sad moment; it was one of the low points of my time in this chamber, that that was necessary. But ignoring the member for Cook's conduct would have left us all complicit. It would have left us all saying, 'Well, that was alright; we're okay with that.' Instead, this government is committed to addressing the loopholes that allowed this abuse of power by one individual, enabled by those around him, to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people now have a government that understands the importance of transparency and accountability, and they are entitled to know who is appointed to administer the departments of their state, who comprises their executives and what offices they hold. We thought this was self-obvious. This information should be available to Australians to find out for themselves, not only when a journalist does, not only when a former prime minister takes it upon himself to brag about his trashing of Westminster institutions to journos writing a book about the dysfunction of his previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our democracy is precious. As we've seen overseas, from the assault on the Capitol building in the US to the recent events in the transition of government in Brazil, no-one around the world can take democracy for granted. All of us in this building hold our democracy in trust for the Australian public. This institution is bigger than all of us. Our conduct in this chamber needs to look to the big picture. We need to put the institution and our democratic traditions ahead of ourselves as individuals, ahead of our narrow paths and political interests. We need to leave these institutions of our democracy in better shape than that in which we received them for those who follow us. Unfortunately, the previous government did damage that will take some time to rectify in terms of public trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As details emerged of the member for Cook's actions, this government referred the matter to the Solicitor-General. We acted. The advice of the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC, was published on 22 August 2022, and the findings were damning. Between March 2020 and May 2021, the member for Cook was appointed by the Governor-General to administer five departments of state: Health; Finance; Industry, Science, Energy and Resources; Treasury; and Home Affairs. This was not made public and was only revealed when the Prime Minister told on himself to journalists writing a book about him. In the words of the Solicitor-General:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The principles of responsible government are fundamentally undermined by the actions of the former government … It is impossible for the parliament to hold ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's astonishing that we even have to say that in this parliament. The findings of the Solicitor-General made clear the need for an appropriate inquiry into the member for Cook's conduct, and the inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments was led by Ms Virginia Bell AC, an outstanding Australian. Ms Bell was eminently qualified for the role, having served as a justice of the High Court for 12 years, following an extensive legal career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Bell inquiry was to examine, and report on, the facts and circumstances surrounding the member for Cook's appointments and the implications arising from them. Ms Bell invited interested individuals and organisations to make submissions, and many did. Contributions were made by current and former public servants, ministers and ministerial advisers, along with academics and other experts in the field of constitutional law and public administration—people with a stake in the functioning of our parliament and our democracy. At the outset of the inquiry, Ms Bell also wrote to the leaders of the minor political parties represented in the parliament, the Independent parliamentarians, the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, inviting them to be heard—all stakeholders in, and trustees of, our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Bell's report was provided to the government on 25 November 2022. She conducted her inquiry with professionalism and dedication. Her report is comprehensive and even-handed. It is an important contribution to the institutional strength of our democracy. Ms Bell found that the member for Cook's appointments were 'unnecessary', as acting ministers could have been appointed 'in a matter of minutes'. The facile justifications of the member for Cook for these appointments—that somehow he needed to be able to take control and save the nation himself, solely, in the face of the COVID pandemic—didn't bear any scrutiny at all. Indeed, the later three appointments to industry, science, energy and resources, home affairs and Treasury, according to Ms Bell, 'had little connection to the pandemic' and were made because of the member for Cook's concern that 'an incumbent minister might exercise his or her statutory powers in a manner with which the member for Cook didn't agree'. It was about megalomania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The institutions and conventions of our democracy are designed to stop any individual from taking power in this way. It is important that we all assert that this was not okay. The member for Cook has learned nothing. He didn't agree to meet with Ms Bell and communicated with her only through lawyers. He has no shame. Ms Bell described the member for Cook's explanations as 'not easy to understand'. I didn't understand them, either—particularly his assertion in this chamber in defence of himself in relation to the censure motion that, if we had just asked him, he would have told us the secret ministries that he had been appointed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has accepted all of Ms Bell's recommendations, with this bill implementing recommendation 1. The bill provides that the Official Secretary to the Governor-General must publish a notifiable instrument, which will be registered on the publicly accessible Federal Register of Legislation as soon as is reasonably practicable, advising that the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the federal Executive Council under section 62 of the Constitution; appointed an officer to administer a department of state; or directed a minister of state to hold an office under section 65 of the Constitution. This bill will apply to appointments made by the Governor-General that take place following the commencement of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining to me, I want to make a few points. Dysfunction has consequences. The former Prime Minister's trashing of convention isn't just a function of Canberra bubble gossip. I do note the shadow minister for home affairs' personal hurt and chagrin at this conduct and her desire for the member for Cook to leave parliament. I agree with that, but it isn't about personal hurt feelings; it's about the hurt national interests. The member for Cook's megalomania had implications for my own portfolio and for Australia's relationship with the world. Echoing his bragging to journalists about these secret ministries, the member for Cook has recently bragged about the way he sidelined my department—the department for foreign affairs—his foreign affairs minister, Senator Marise Payne, and the then Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Frances Adamson, from the development of the AUKUS proposal until the very last moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from the same journalist, Simon Benson in an article headlined 'Scott Morrison kept AUKUS secret from cabinet ministers and senior diplomats'. Benson says, 'Senior diplomats and cabinet ministers were kept in the dark over AUKUS.' He quotes Mr Morrison:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was the most remarkably held project that I suspect many could ever recall … This secrecy was so essential because the second it moved outside those who only needed to know, it was a risk.</span>

It's a symptom of the crazy dysfunction and personal, individual megalomaniacal nature of that member for Cook and his personal weirdness about Australia's national interest. And, really, this was a bloke worried about national security leaks! That was his justification for not telling his own foreign affairs minister. This is a bloke who gave a TikTok of the deliberations of the National Security Committee to journalists writing a book about him. The calls are coming from inside the building.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese trusts his ministers and runs a functioning cabinet government, and the recent announcement of the Optimal Pathway for the AUKUS agreement benefited as a result. Minister Wong; the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, beside me; and the Prime Minister made more than 60 calls into our region—calls with our partners, calls with people who we wanted to understand our rationale of why we were entering into the biggest investment in our defence capability in our history. These calls, this groundwork, this diplomacy, this exercise of our foreign policy, paid dividends. It's reflected in the way that the optimal pathway announcement was received in our region by our partners.</span>

Those of us in this building, and particularly in the ministry, hold it in trust for the Australian people. But it's not an abstract concept; it underpins Australia's freedom, Australia's prosperity and the way that our society operates. It only exists because of the norms and the laws and the constitutional arrangements that our country operates under. We all have an obligation in this building and in the cabinet to put this institution, our democracy, before our own individual political interests.</span>

This is a bill that shouldn't need to be passed because what it seeks to correct should never really have been at risk. We shouldn't need to come in and legislate for basic honesty and transparency and clarity around our system of governance. We shouldn't need to legislate the expectation that the Prime Minister would be straight with the Australian people and that a government would be straight with the Australian people. You would think that, as a basic duty and obligation, anyone who has the privilege to serve in this place would start with that as No. 1 on their priority list when they come into this House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that rules, conventions, norms and sensible behaviours—the sensible observance of integrity—are critical to the good function of government in a way that is very, very substantial, and we know that bad practice leads to bad outcomes. We know that weak and perverted governance leads to incompetent and dishonest government. We know that because we just spent the last several years experiencing that. The Australian community just spent the last several years seeing that up close and personal. That kind of perverted, dishonest, incompetent, unaccountable government inevitably hurts the Australian community, and it hurt the Australian community in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Robodebt is what happens when you have a government that is a stranger to transparency, accountability and decency. That's what happens. Tens of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians get, at the very least, the fright of their lives—at the very least. Tens of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians get hit with debt notices that are wrong and unlawful, and the consequences in some cases, as we know, are the gravest that there can be. There are circumstances that have been disclosed to the robodebt royal commission that involve people taking their lives because the former government, the coalition government, was so awfully incompetent and unaccountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just a case of ignoring the sensible requirements of transparency and accountability that we ought to be able to take for granted; it was a case, in many instances, of intentionally perverting or covering up matters that the Australian community deserved to know about. It happened with the secret multiple ministerial moonlighting of the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook. It happened with the secret million-dollar donations to the legal fund of the former Attorney-General. It happened on multiple occasions. It happened with the secret legal advice—that never saw the light of day until all that catastrophic harm had occurred—that said that robodebt was wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Gellibrand just said, the one thing that has been notable in the 10 months since the change of government is that, in relation to all of those awful failures, there has not been one skerrick of collective reflection and responsibility from those opposite. Is it too much to ask, when you have patently failed in your obligations and your duties to the Australian people, that you at least acknowledge that, take responsibility for it and apologise for it? Under the previous government, long gone were the days when a minister, looking squarely in the face of the kind of failure that robodebt represented, would not have any particular courage but would just do the basic decent thing and say: 'I have to take responsibility for that.' There were, frankly, multiple ministers who could have done it. They could've had a conversation amongst themselves about who was perhaps best placed to wear that opprobrium, but so far that has not happened to one degree. We've not heard the word 'sorry' once from any of the people involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the parliament gave those opposite the opportunity for a bit of self-reflection, a bit of ex post facto accountability, those opposite weren't interested. The fact is that, when this House censured the member for Cook, which, frankly, was really the bare minimum that ought to have occurred in terms of recognising the gravity of the failure that has occurred and the deception of the Australian people that has occurred, those opposite voted to oppose that motion and essentially to support that conduct, and they gathered around the member for Cook afterwards, smiling and patting shoulders and shaking hands. I understand that. I've actually got nothing against people showing care for one another. The fact that someone on the other side might have taken the time afterwards to say privately to the member for Cook, 'It's a bit of a tough day when you get censured in the House of Representatives,' is okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking after one another through tough times is okay. But when you all have been tarnished by that kind of behaviour, to vote against the very sensible and, frankly, relatively mild recognition in the Australian parliament of something that should never ever have occurred—a bloke secretly swearing himself into multiple ministries, not even telling the ministers responsible. When that occurs, rather than taking the opportunity to say 'That was wrong. We recognise that was wrong. We don't want that to ever happen again,' and reflecting the sombre and serious nature of what a censure in the House of Representatives represents, you get people who couldn't rush over quickly enough to smile and laugh and clap the member for Cook on the back as if nothing had occurred, and that tells you a lot about the state of denial that those opposite are in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, the institutions and conventions that guide the best form of our Westminster parliamentary system are not window dressing. They are not optional extras. It is not the difference between whether you wear a tie or don't wear a tie in this place. They are the guardrails for proper government. They are the guarantors of competence and integrity. They are the buffers against incompetence and consequential harm that follows. If we can't do those things better and if we can't set right some of the failure that we saw under the previous government, then democracy in Australia will be weaker for it, and the quality of government that the Australian people receive will be weaker for it. It is worth noting that the—<span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Quorum for</span><span style="font-style:italic;">med</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span> Clearly that was too much truth for those opposite. I mean, why take responsibility and show some accountability for the frankly disgusting behaviour of the former government when you can just play silly games, when you can get up and interrupt people in the middle of saying something that is pretty important? I think the Australian people don't ever again want to see a situation where you have a secretive and deceptive Prime Minister going about arrogating power to themselves in multiple important ministries, appearing not to even remember which departments they'd been sworn into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth had to be dragged out of the member for Cook; that should be recognised. The member for Cook couldn't decide or remember, apparently, exactly which secret alternative ministerial costumes he had put in the closet for his use, and he never ever acknowledged the fact that what he did was wrong or unnecessary. As the member for Gellibrand said, he tried to excuse it afterwards with a whole range of pathetic excuses, including suggesting that it was in the nation's interest and it was better for the nation's defence and security. Frankly, that is ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth only came out, as we know, because the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister, bragged in relative secret to the writers of a book about it, because he thought the story would somehow reflect well on him afterwards—that it would show his preparedness to do anything, in his own twisted version of high-handed, top-down government. Not only did it take weeks and weeks of multiple interviews for the member for Cook to make clear the actual details of the various ministries that he'd secretly sworn himself into, but in the last few weeks we've learned that the former member for Tangney was sworn into one of his colleagues' departments. We've also learned that the member for Cook was very proud of the way that he kept the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs completely in the dark about some of the most serious defence and security matters that were under contemplation at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian democracy matters. All of it matters—the hardware and the software, the rules and the conventions, and certainly the behaviours and the norms. Ironically, from a coalition government whose twin ideological themes are, on the one hand, faith in the markets and, on the other hand, a desire to protect and maintain important conservative institutions, we had a complete abandonment of both of those kinds of thought. There was no interest in sensible market solutions to big issues like climate change or waste and recycling and there was a complete trashing of Australia's democratic institutions, norms and conventions. That is something that we can only hope they will reflect upon, but, from what we've seen to date, there's little evidence of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I think we're going to have to keep saying this in here multiple times every day until something changes: it is still astounding that a government can inflict illegal and wrong debt notices on tens of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians and that those responsible can be incapable—as yet—of saying openly that it was wrong, that it was a scandalous piece of incompetence—harmful, immoral incompetence. Not one person is prepared to say that. The coalition parties, individually or together, are not capable of saying that. There's been no ministerial accountability. There's been no acknowledgement at the leadership level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to put Australia democracy on a much healthier and higher quality foundation. We're doing that with this bill—which shouldn't really need to be passed—to simply make it crystal clear, particularly to those opposite, that Australians are entitled to expect accountability and transparency from their government. We've done it with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and we'll continue to do it through the leadership and conduct of the Albanese Labor government.</span>

                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I'm going to use a couple of words that we haven't seen for a while, and they are 'transparency' and 'accountability'. They're words that mean a lot inside this building, but out in the rest of Australia people often don't know what 'transparency' and 'accountability' are when it comes to the Westminster system of democracy. But they are essential terms, in the same way that, in the military—as I see the member for Solomon leaving—words like 'honour' and 'loyalty' might be essential. They're words that people live their lives by. Similarly, when it comes to good government, words like 'transparency' and 'accountability' must inform all that you do in government. Government is a messy business. It is not perfect. As they say, democracy is the worst system of government, but it's better than all the rest. Democracy only works when there is transparency and accountability. Sadly, those two words, 'transparency' and 'accountability', are not words we can associate with the former Morrison government. How many times did they, through their actions, fail to be accountable and transparent? Because of my love of poetry, I might quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning: 'Let me count the ways.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the member for Hume hiding the rises in electricity prices till after the election? Remember the colour-coded spreadsheets of sports rorts? Remember the park-and-rides for train stations that didn't actually exist? That was a Victorian special, I think—more pork than a piggery. Unbelievable. Remember robodebt? How shocking has the testimony at the royal commission been—400,000 Australians, some of them our most vulnerable Australians, robbed by a government. Remember the coalition government failing to order enough PPE at the start of the pandemic, then ordering PPE from overseas instead of backing in our local manufacturing businesses? Remember them not ordering enough vaccines? Remember them picking fights with premiers instead of working together through one of Australia's most difficult hours, through the pandemic? Remember the French submarine fiasco, where we built a big shed for the French? Remember the PM going on holidays during a bushfire disaster, and then there being lies told about that holiday, a holiday that no-one would begrudge any Prime Minister? And just last week we found out that Ben Morton, the former member for Tangney, was appointed by the Governor-General to administer the Department of Home Affairs, and it seems that the current member for Capricornia was included in the secrecy as well. Of course, this was never made public. Even the then Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, said she knew nothing about it, although I acknowledge that she did call it out later, to her never-ending credit. Sadly, I couldn't say the same of the rest of her former cabinet colleagues. They're like cardboard in the rain: they've completely lost their structural integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads us to what this bill before the chamber, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, is all about—ensuring that we do not see the shameful exploitation of the rules that allow a Prime Minister to secretly appoint themselves as a minister of the Crown. We're doing this because the former Prime Minister the member for Cook appointed himself to five extra portfolios. We have had other prime ministers briefly have a couple of portfolios. I know that we saw it with Whitlam and others, when they were fresh into government, but this was not one of those circumstances. We'd already had the Abbott-Turnbull conga line progression through to Morrison, the member for Cook, not an MP who I would say is blessed with lots of vision. I've seen disused service stations with more vision than the member for Cook. But he thought he needed more power. He made five self-appointments that he told no-one in his own government about, although at least two National MPs knew, after he swooped in and scuttled PEP-11. But it seems they didn't bother to tell anyone, because they were more focused on squeezing some extra stuff out of the deal for the Nationals—not the Australian people. They were just looking after themselves—reprehensible. It's almost as bad as their position on the Voice. How out of touch with the bush are these people in the Nationals?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other four ministers whom the member for Cook rode roughshod over—including his supposed best mate, the then Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg—had no idea about this set of arrangements. The fourth estate didn't know, and the Australian people didn't know. That's why this parliament needs to fix it so that it can never happen again. We need to take action to protect our valuable, precious democratic conventions. It's a very sorry day to be in parliament and have to protect our democracy in such a way in 2023. We have to ensure that the Australian public are able to access information related to the composition of the federal Executive Council. It's bizarre that we're doing it, I know, for those listening—that we have to protect our democracy. This is how bizarre the circumstances that befall us because of the actions of the member for Cook are. Those appointed to administer certain departments of state and the high offices that ministers of state hold should all be public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's with some reflection that I think of the actions that have been taken since. I will detail them. We had the Solicitor-General's advice that what had occurred was incorrect—no surprises there. We had Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Attorney-General establish an inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments, led by former High Court justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC, a very well-respected legal mind. Those opposite moaned that this was nothing more than a witch-hunt or a political pointscoring exercise. Maybe that's why they're taking quorum calls throughout the day. I'm not sure. I wanted to know: how was this allowed to happen, who was involved and, most importantly, how can we stop it happening again? As I said when I started this speech, transparency and accountability were not the hallmarks of the Morrison LNP government, but they will be the hallmarks of every Labor government. If the member for Cook hadn't casually told reporters who were writing a book about him what he had done, we might well still be in the dark today. This is why the investigation was required and essential. The final report was provided to government on 25 November 2022, which now leads to where we are today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government accepted all of Ms Bell's recommendations, and the introduction of this bill is one part of meeting that commitment—debating and voting for legislation to ensure that such behaviour could never happen again. Democracy is too precious. We cannot allow our system of government, parliament and cabinet to be undermined like this ever again. We cannot have another situation where our prime minister secretly desires to be the health minister, the finance minister, the industry, science, energy and resources minister, the Treasurer and the home affairs minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's little wonder that trust in our democracy is at an all-time low. That is sad for most of us in this place—and I mean on both sides of the chamber—who take our role in this democratic institution very seriously and professionally. I'm proud to be a parliamentarian, and I take my duty seriously. Most of us in this place, irrespective of where we sit in the chamber, are here because we believe in the power of democracy, of representation, of this parliament and of governments to change the lives of Australians for the better. That is why most people want to be in parliament and want to work for those changes on behalf of their constituents. I've been here since 2007, and I would say all but one, two or three of the people I've met in that time—MPs and senators—have been motivated by the same thing: to help their constituents or the people they represent—if, indeed, that is what senators do. The fact that a Prime Minister of this country had such disregard for those principles was shocking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it was the right thing for this parliament to censure the former Prime Minister. I noted, as earlier speakers have noted, that there was then a queue of blokes lining up to pat him on the back. Support is one thing, but brazenly pushing away any skerrick of responsibility was not the right gesture, I would suggest. The parliament and we here as representatives of the people in our communities had to stand up and say this was a serious breach of trust and must never happen again. It was a sad sight to see all of that backslapping and the congratulations after the member for Cook spoke against the censure. It just shows that they still can't see how damaging the actions of the former PM were and that they were as badly deceived by the member for Cook as the Australian people were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this would never happen under our Prime Minister and our government, but who's to say that a future conservative government might not think, 'Hey, let's do it again'? So the parliament was right to censure the former Prime Minister, because this must never happen. It must not happen again, because the people who are elected to this place to represent their communities, and even more so the people who are appointed to ministries and to be prime minister of this country, need to be publicly recognised. They should have at their heart a respect for democracy and for the conventions of our system that enable ministers, governments and members to be held accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill will require the Official Secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument on the Federal Register of Legislation as soon as reasonably practical in the following circumstances: when the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council, or when the Governor-General has appointed an officer to administer a department of state or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It will also require notification of the revocation of any of these positions to be published. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The notifiable instrument will include the name of the person, the department of state, where appropriate, and the date on which they were sworn, appointed or directed. In the case of revocations, the notifiable instrument is to include the name of the person, the name of the former office and the date that such membership appointment or direction was revoked. The notifiable instrument may also comprise a copy of an instrument issued by the Governor-General. These are the necessary steps to provide trust and accountability to the people of Australia. They need to know who ministers are. We cannot have a situation where secrecy is at the heart of appointments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill shows that the Albanese government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics. The measures in the bill will help restore integrity and transparency in the process of appointing elected officials to high office and ensure that we have a system of government where there are checks and balances. Never let anyone have too much power. Never again will one person be able to garner powers without adequate and warranted accountability, both to the Australian people and, more importantly, to the Australian parliament, where their representatives sit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, as the centrepiece of returning accountability and transparency to politics at the federal level is the establishment of the powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. It's something that Labor took to the last election, something that will make sure we take another step towards restoring accountability in the Australian democratic system. I commend the legislation to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  After it was revealed that the former Prime Minister secretly appointed himself to five additional ministries, these matters were referred to the Solicitor-General, Dr Stephen Donaghue KC. He advised this, and it's worth quoting this statement: 'The principles of responsible government are fundamentally undermined by the actions of the former government.' It's a simple statement. It's clear, concise and simple. Three former Liberal prime ministers of Australia condemned the former Prime Minister for his conduct. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>That simple statement by Dr Stephen Donaghue KC was followed by condemnation of the former Prime Minister's conduct by no fewer than three former Liberal prime ministers of Australia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Prime Minister refuses—still—to acknowledge how his actions have diminished and impacted our democracy. This is really the fundamental point, here, because some people might ask, 'Why does this matter?' His actions do matter. They matter not only because he was prime minister at the time but also because integrity matters, because transparency matters and because trust in our democratic institutions matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time not just in Australia but also globally when there is a 'trust deficit' in democracy—when democracies are under fire, under attack, both from external sources and internally, where there's disruption, disinformation and distrust of democratic governance—his actions absolutely matter. His actions have added to the diminishment of trust in our democratic system. From the position of highest office in this country, that of prime minister, that is the last thing you should be doing. You have an obligation and a responsibility not only to your fellow Australians but also to the very core of our democracy—its value. He took actions that diminished that value in the eyes of Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians see the struggle for democracy around the world. There are many brave people—this is not just a principle—who are protesting in the streets for their freedom, for democracy, and they are dying for those principles. We often take these matters for granted. We talk about them in the abstract. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw a comparison: a holder of the highest office and their responsibility and obligation, and the trashing of that integrity, that trust in democracy, through their actions versus a person on the streets of Myanmar, a 20-something protester who is willing to face real bullets to stand up for democracy. Just think about that for a moment. There are tens of thousands of people standing and fighting for their freedom, and for this democracy that we sometimes take for granted. They're fighting for their fundamental rights, and they're doing so in the face of abhorrent repression. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Atrocities have occurred, for example, on the streets of Myanmar. In Iran, there's a revolution for democracy driven by women, led by women—led by young women and girls in high school—who have bravely stood up against a theocratic regime and said, 'Enough!' They're willing to lose their lives for those principles. The people of Myanmar continue to experience the use of force against them—aerial bombing, the burning down of civilian homes and all manner of grave human rights violations that the military junta continue to persist in utilising against the democracy movement. These people believe in democracy. They are willing to die for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crimes against humanity continue against many peoples around the world. Those protesters know what we, at least, know intellectually—that democracy, the freedom that comes with it, is worth fighting for and worth dying for. Thousands have been killed for that principle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, Australia is one of the world's oldest continuous and successful democracies, and as representatives of that democratic system the least we can do is stand up in solidarity with those people who do not live in a democracy, have had it taken away from them or are fighting for it. It's important that we feel compelled to hear their voices of protest. We can't shut our ears or our eyes to what is happening, and we can't take for granted the hard-fought efforts of previous generations of Australians to fight for the democracy that we benefit from today. Let's be really blunt about this: the actions of the former prime minister in that context are retrograde. They are, effectively, in the eyes of Australians, a complete diminishment of the value of our democracy by the highest office holder in the land. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the previous generations of Australians, and we often talk about many previous generations who fought, frankly, against Nazis, and fascism in World War 2, in which 40,000 Australians died. They were fighting to protect and defend Australia. They were also fighting for a better world, a world that was not overcome by totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, like the Nazis and what they represented. That's real courage and commitment to what we see potentially in our day-to-day lives. We don't think about democracy that much; it's more of an abstract principle when we talk about it. But it is very tangible and very real when you don't have it. You can touch it, when you don't have it, and you can see what you're missing, feel what you're missing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ensure that the people of Australia can trust us as government officials in government and in parliament because we do have an obligation and a responsibility by virtue of the offices that we hold. By virtue of the fact that we are elected representatives to this place, we have a greater responsibility to the national interest with respect to standing up and defending our democracy, not trashing it, not diminishing it, not putting in doubt the integrity of the institutions that Australians rely on. We cannot be complacent in that respect—in fact, in the current climate that we face, with all the attempts to interfere in our system of government and in our democracy and all the attempts at disruption and disinformation, we actually have a responsibility to strengthen these institutions. We have a responsibility to protect our rule of law, to protect our democracy and to restore our international reputation for having robust democratic institutions that ensure the people of Australia can again have trust in our democratic processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we do a lot of politics, and sometimes it is quite partisan. But there is also substance and evidence to back up what I'm saying. In 2021 Australia received its worst ever corruption score, a global measurement generated by Transparency International. This score is associated with a lack of integrity. As I said, integrity is the cornerstone of any strong democratic system of government, and it's very closely connected to trust. Integrity reassures the Australian people that their government is working in everyone's best interests. For too long there was no Commonwealth agency devoted to integrity issues or to investigating possible corrupt conduct at the federal level. This gave too many freedoms and enabled the former prime minister to abuse the trust of the Australian people. The decline that we have seen, that lack of integrity and lack of trust that emanated from it, has probably been the most disturbing aspect of that debacle. Those actions weakened, undermined and completely diminished integrity in politics. Most of us here know how hard it is, when we talk to our constituents, to find a constituent that still trusts a politician. There's a lot of cynicism about politics and politicians. Well, those actions of the former Prime Minister really added fuel to that fire, didn't they? It's hard enough to gain the trust of the people we represent without the highest officeholder in the land trashing the integrity of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 10 short months, I think it's clear to say, and important to note, that the Albanese Labor government is changing this. We've passed legislation in this place to create a powerful, independent and transparent national anticorruption commission—something those opposite refused to do when they were in government; they sat on it. We value transparency, accountability and promptly acting to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials. We need this transparency because our system of parliamentary democracy relies upon such conventions. It relies upon the Westminster system and the traditions of checks and balances, and that is what transparency and accountability are about at the highest levels of government—rebuilding trust, something the Morrison government did not champion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we should never take our democracy for granted. We should never take trust in our institutions for granted. There are people who are fighting and dying around the world for those principles, for democracy—something that we enjoy here in Australia. The former Prime Minister's actions diminished integrity and trust in our system. That's why we are taking action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today with a small but important amendment to the Education Legislation Amendment (Startup Year and Other Measures) Bill 2023. One of the important objectives of this bill is to create a new form of higher education loan program or HELP assistance, currently known in the bill as the SY-HELP loans—SY for 'startup year'. These loans will help students build skills in an area of great importance to Australia and its future prosperity. The loans will support the participation of final year undergraduate students, current postgrad students and recent graduates in accelerator program courses at Australian universities and Australian colleges. Hopefully they will be successful and go on to become as well known as HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the understanding of what these loans are for will be improved by having a name which more directly references the kinds of courses for which they will be available. My amendment proposes that the loans currently referred to in the bill as 'SY-HELP' be termed 'Start-up-HELP.' This will make clear at a glance what the loans refer to and help make accessing these loans more user friendly. I have discussed these changes with the government, and I understand that they will support this amendment, which will make it easier for students interested in undertaking startup year programs. I commend the amendment to the House.</span>

We look forward to that to see whether there are any other practical amendments which might even further improve the bill. I thank the member for Mackellar for bringing this before the House.</span>

I think there is a great opportunity for us, in terms of the bill as a whole, to send a very important signal in terms of us tapping into the ideas of young Australians to build new businesses.

We want to get a wider range of people building those businesses—in particular I note the presence of the member for Goldstein; we spoke about this in the National Reconstruction Fund—particularly female founders, people from under-represented groups and people from groups beyond city boundaries who are able to use that network, the architecture of regionally based universities, to do that and create businesses in our regions as well.

I'm very grateful for the amendment put forward and the fact that we are very focused on sending the signal that young Australian's ideas and know-how matter. Creating firms that will create good jobs and being able to call up people from all corners to do so is a great thing. I want to express my support for the amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  When I heard that the former Prime Minister the member for Cook did what he did in terms of his executive positions, I thought back to Sir Henry Parkes, who of course was the Premier of the Colony of New South Wales on multiple occasions and who is known as the Father of Federation. His great Tenterfield School of Arts speech was where he really set the platform for conventions that would take place across a number of years before we got to the point in January 1901 when we became a federation. Sir Henry Parkes said this, and I think it's relevant to this particular debate today:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I believe that the time has come, and if two Governments set an example, the others must soon of necessity follow. There will be an uprising in this fair land of a goodly fabric of free Government, and all great national questions of magnitude affecting the welfare of the colonies will be disposed of by a fully authorised constitutional authority. This means a distinct executive and a distinct parliamentary power for the whole of Australia, and it means a Parliament of two Houses, a House of Commons and a Senate, which will legislate on these great subjects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Henry Parkes understood it. He understood the idea of a parliament for the whole of the country. He called it a House of Commons. We call it a House of Representatives, as per the American system. But he got it and the idea that the states would be represented in a senate. He understood the fact that there would be a constitution that would establish the parliament and establish the country and establish the executive, and that the monarch and the monarch's representative would be referred to the Governor-General. He got the idea of a distinct executive. Those were his words, 'a distinct executive'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw by the member for Cook as Prime Minister was a muddling of that distinct executive, so we didn't know who was accountable. And not only did the public not know, his ministers didn't know, his caucus didn't know and the opposition didn't know. So that distinct executive that Sir Henry Parkes talked about was dishonoured. He utterly dishonoured a distinct constitutional authority and that we have a constitution in this country. I wondered what people like George Reid, a Conservative prime minister, a former governor of New South Wales, would have thought; what Edmund Barton would have thought; or Alfred Deakin would have thought about that. It's important in the establishment of our constitutional system of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I learned, when I was at the University of Queensland studying law all those years ago, that our system of government is not just about the Constitution but about the principles of constitutionalism, where there is a separation of powers in a Westminster system of government. In some respects, it's a Washminster system, with a Senate rather than a House of Lords, but the executive must be accountable to the parliament. That means that the parliament must know who's serving in distinct offices, that there must be a distinct executive, to pick up Sir Henry Parkes's words. We didn't know that. The public didn't know that. The government didn't know it. The member for Cook kept that secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Democracy is a fragile thing. I come from the state of Queensland, where, growing up, at times it was a bit like a hillbilly dictatorship, where one political party could get elected with 18 per cent of the vote and form a majority in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, where ministers in the executive had conflicts of interest and decided on issues of mining leasing when they themselves had shares in those companies. A Premier could arrange a voting system in a gerrymandered way to make sure not only that the Labor Party was disadvantaged but also that the Liberal Party was disadvantaged. Representative democracy was trashed. Sir Henry Parkes talked about the idea of a house, this place, that was representative of the people, and a Senate, the other place, that was representative of the states. We are fortunate that the forefathers of this country decided that we wouldn't have a House of Lords, a sort of bunyip dictatorship or aristocracy, but we would have a parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, tragically, is a necessity because the member for Cook didn't listen to Henry Parkes, Alfred Deakin, Edmund Barton or even the great Labor hero Andrew Fisher, one of the early prime ministers. I wonder what those prime ministers who served in office in the first two decades of our Federation would have thought about a Prime Minister, 100 years later, confusing the public. They had a Minister for the Navy, a Postmaster-General and an Attorney-General. They had these types of distinct ministerial positions. There were fewer, because our country is more complex now and it's a lot bigger in population. The NBN, the internet and TV weren't known to Andrew Fisher when he was growing up, when he came from Gympie as the member for Wide Bay. He wouldn't have understood about them. It would have been science fiction to him. But the principles of 100 years ago or more still apply. In the last few years, in countries that we honour and believe are our allies and friends and that we identify with, like the United States of America, Brazil, and other places, we've seen people take peaceful protest to the point where it's almost armed insurrection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that we have before the chamber today is absolutely vital because of what the member for Cook did. I never thought I would see a prime minister do that. I never thought I'd see a prime minister appoint himself to a variety of different ministerial posts without it being published. I wonder what the former member for Kooyong really thinks in his heart of hearts about the fact that the former Prime Minister was appointed to the Treasury in his place, when they were bunking together in the Lodge during COVID. The former Prime Minister did not tell him, his good friend and political ally, that he was actually in the same role as him. When we were asking questions of the Treasurer or the Minister for Home Affairs in the last parliament, when we sat on that side of the chamber, we could have been asking them of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister didn't tell anyone. It's no good the member for Cook saying: 'You never asked me. No-one ever asked me. Therefore I didn't tell.' That's just not good enough. I mean, seriously, what sort of insult is that to the intelligence of not just this chamber but his colleagues? I can't believe how disrespectful he was to his own ministerial colleagues and to his own caucus. I am absolutely convinced that, if he'd told his colleagues about what he had done in appointing himself to all those portfolios, without them knowing whatsoever, he would not have been the Prime Minister within 24 or 48 hours. They would have simply shunted him off. I'm convinced there would have been a special caucus meeting of the Liberal Party, and he would have been replaced either by the member for Kooyong or by the member for Dickson. I'm sure that would have been the case. But he didn't tell anyone about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got legislation here that has come about through the advice of the Solicitor-General and of an eminent former justice of the High Court of Australia. It really is sad that we've had to bring this legislation before the chamber, and that we have to make sure that when you're appointed to a ministerial post it's actually published so the public can know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What possessed the member for Cook to think this? He got elected by the public in that area of the shire; they voted for him. You would think that at some level he respected democracy or the democratic process. To think he could come into this place, sit in that chair and in that office, and not tell anyone that he'd done this is just astounding. And then he appointed other people, like the member for Capricornia and his good mate the member for Tangney, into roles as well. At the time they were assistant ministers. There was an assistant minister getting responsibility for one of the most important portfolios, Home Affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder what the member for McPherson really thought? I'll give her her due: she's been very clear and very succinct about what she thought in some respects. I would have been furious with the member for Cook. And it's hard to believe that the former member for Tangney—we've got a good member for Tangney now—wouldn't have understood. Wouldn't you have thought that Ben Morton would have rung up and said: 'By the way, Karen, I just got appointed to this role. Is there any brief you'd like me to do? Perhaps I can approve a few visas while I go.' But it never happened.</span>

                    </a>  That's right. There was a backlog of one million; that's a lot of backlog. If they'd appointed three or four people to get through the visa backlog that would have been a good thing, but they didn't do it at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The excuse of the member for Cook was that, somehow, he wanted to appoint himself for COVID reasons. It would have taken a couple of minutes to appoint a new minister! The other excuse I heard him say was that it was because he couldn't trust the member for Hinkler—I think that's who it was—with a decision he might make in terms of resources and the environment. Honestly, how much faith did the member for Cook have in his National Party colleagues that he couldn't trust him to do that? It's just amazing that in 2022, 2021 and 2020 he was doing all this stuff. Sometimes governments use all manner of excuses during emergencies to avoid democratic accountability and transparency, but this takes the level of hypocrisy, secrecy and covert operations to an astronomical level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a sad day for Australian democracy when we had a censure motion in this chamber in relation to the conduct of the member for Cook, not because we had to do it but because he put himself in a position where it was so important to say to this place that representatives who are elected by their constituencies can have a say. It was important to say to the member for Cook, 'What you did was not on.' I couldn't believe it when those opposite were going up to him and kissing the ring—almost kissing the hand—after that particular vote, instead of saying: 'Look, you did the wrong thing. Own up and confess.' The fact that he didn't cooperate with the Bell inquiry, except through his lawyers—he had to lawyer up—is an indication there was a challenge. Power can be abused, and it was being abused with those appointments. And it should never have been abused. We need to know who's appointed to administer departments of state. It's not a hard thing; we get that. We're entitled to know who's in government and who's not in government. The public, who go to the ballot box, do the pre-poll and do the postal votes, are entitled to know as well. It's a simple process. I can't believe that we learnt all about this through the good efforts of a journalist—and I give credit to the journalist involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we learnt about this because the Prime Minister decided to cooperate in the writing of a book. It's about the folly of a criminal who gets caught because they're bragging on the mobile phone. They get their mobile phone and start bragging about something. It's the stupidity of the person who's a criminal who gets caught that way. And he's decided to reveal all and get his story out. He told the journalist about it and so a book's been written about it. He thought that was the appropriate way to reveal information. When the information came out that way and was published in the media, he thought, 'Oh, I'm going to take umbrage at this.' I listened to his press conference and I listened to that speech that day, and he still doesn't get it, at all. There's no admission of responsibility; there's no bearing of that responsibility. I say this to the member for Cook: you need to bear fruit that befits repentance, to use a good biblical saying. You need to say, 'I made a mistake. I did the wrong thing and I need to improve'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is important because of what the member for Cook did. It's sad we've got to do it, but it's a matter of necessity and I support it.</span>

I take no enjoyment in speaking to this, but it is important to do so. Our job is not about doing what is easy. It's about doing what is right. It is a deep honour to be in this place, to represent the people of Australia. This privilege also comes with great responsibilities—responsibilities that I do not take lightly. The Australian people rightfully expect a standard of behaviour from their parliamentarians. They rightfully demand that their leaders do the right things. As the government we set an example. We set a standard. The member for Cook, while Prime Minister, failed to meet the standard befitting an Australian parliamentarian. While Prime Minister of Australia, the member for Cook appointed himself to administer five additional departments. The then Prime Minister failed to inform the cabinet. The then Prime Minister failed to inform the House of Representatives. The then Prime Minister failed to inform the Australian public. In fact, the Australian public only became aware of these appointments after they were revealed by the media.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This secrecy is unconscionable. It is hard to fathom that this took place in Australia, one of the guiding lights of democracy in the world. The words from the Solicitor-General are damning. The Solicitor-General found that the principles of responsible government had been 'fundamentally undermined'. The Solicitor-General also found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing can survive in darkness and we need light to prosper. The findings of the Solicitor-General made it clear that a thorough inquiry was needed. This inquiry was led by Ms Virginia Bell AC. s Bell confirmed the Solicitor-General's view that the principles of responsible government were 'fundamentally undermined'. Ms Bell found that the appointments were unnecessary. Ms Bell found that these appointments were made because the former Prime Minister was concerned that an incumbent minister might exercise his or her statutory powers in a manner with which Mr Morrison did not agree. This is not the spirit of democracy. This is not the Australian way, to override someone because they make a decision that you do not like.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have three children. One day, when my children were little, four years old, they were playing in another room. They were carrying on, you know, being silly, being kids. My wife and I heard something smash, something fragile hitting the floor and breaking. I went into the next room. I saw a vase in pieces on the floor. I saw three very sheepish children looking at me. I asked my kids, 'Did someone break the vase?' All my children shook their heads and did not look into my eyes anymore. So, I got down onto their level, on one knee, and I asked again, very calmly and gently, 'Did someone break the vase?' One of my kids slowly put up their hand. I thanked them for being so honest and truthful. Then I told my kids: 'You know there is no shame in making mistakes. We all make mistakes. That is what makes us human. What is unacceptable is being dishonest about the mistake you have made.' I taught my kids that it is not acceptable to make excuses. I taught them that we must take responsibility for our actions. My children had learnt that lesson by the age of four. Imagine my disdain when the member for Cook failed to take responsibility for his underhanded actions as the then Prime Minister? </span>

I would not accept this from my children when they broke that vase all those years ago. I won't accept it now. The member for Cook said that, if people had asked, he would have answered. This erosion of transparency is a slippery slope. It's like rain that leads to a landslide. As a police officer, I saw the consequences of the abuse of power. I saw the real risk of an insidious lack of integrity. As parliamentarians, we take an oath to represent and protect our communities. We must be trusted to govern with probity, to be responsible custodians. We must be held to account for our actions. The foundations of our democratic institutions depend on it. </span>

We need to restore the public's faith in elected officials. This bill shows that the government is delivering on its promises to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government. I welcome the implementation of the first six recommendations from the Bell inquiry. Our democracy is precious. We must protect it together. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  At the last election I was humbled and honoured to win my seat of Paterson and get the vote from the majority of people for a third time. It really is an incredible honour, something that I never forget about and something that I think about often. It was a brutal campaign. I was up against a tough opponent who was cashed up. She had been on the ground for 12 months offering up more of the same. There were a lot of promises, a lot of criticisms of Albo and of me, a lot of TV ads and a sea of corflutes—not to mention many visits by the Prime Minister to either my seat or, more broadly, my region of the Hunter. What there wasn't was a commitment to a national integrity commission. There wasn't a commitment to take responsibility or change the ways of the Morrison government. There wasn't a commitment to be a better government. When I look back on that, it was such an incredible hint at what was really going on behind closed doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what excited me about the campaign was that there were many new constituents. My area had become somewhat of a safe place for people who knew that they didn't want to live in close quarters in Sydney and some of our bigger cities any longer. They took the opportunity to be able to work from home to move to the regions. I thought that was a fantastic thing. I love meeting them and talking to them. Many of them were incredibly surprised at how much the regions had to offer them: the space, the air, the environment, the opportunity and the good jobs. It really was such an incredible experience for so many people. There was better housing affordability, a better lifestyle and the natural beauty. I can distinctly remember one lady who I spoke to, and she said: 'I never in a million years thought I would look out of my kitchen window and see cows. I cannot tell you what a difference that has made to my outlook on life.' Isn't it funny that it's the things we often take for granted that can make such a pivotal difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What worried me though was long-term residents, who were concerned about many newcomers—not the people themselves but the pressure that they put on things like roads and infrastructure. They were worried about not being able to get into the doctor, the dentist or the vet. Even the local mechanic had a big queue. The roads were more congested, and even parking was becoming an issue in some towns where, truly, it had never been a problem. The world seemed to be changing so rapidly after COVID, and those people felt the former government just wasn't keeping up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That government at that time, of course, was changed because people had that sense that, whilst they had done a reasonable job during the pandemic, they had slid so far between the pandemic and that election. Everyone noticed that the cost of living was increasing and interest rates were rising. They were waking up to the fact that the trickle-down economy was really only working for the very wealthy. Retirees and young people alike were worried about their futures. They were sick of being told to get a job or get a better job; to stop renting and buy a house; and that climate change wasn't really a thing they should worry about. They were being told that our goals were being met at a canter. They were indirectly being told by their Prime Minister, 'I don't hold a hose, mate.' They were being told that international relations broadly didn't matter unless you were swapping red caps. They were being told 'how good' everything was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, people simply weren't buying it. Mr Morrison had exposed himself as not the daggy dad that everyone had wanted to embrace and just a knockabout good fellow but as someone who was of a much different character. That worried people. It was as if the daggy dad, when scratched a little deeper, had a darker side. They were very worried about that, and they were worried about the lack of substance. He was also showing his incompetence, and he was starting to show his true character. Sadly, for him, Australians just didn't like what they saw.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this business you do have to have a thick skin. You can't take things too personally. It is difficult. I will never get used to people saying to me, 'Oh, you politicians are all alike.' That's actually not the case; we are not all alike. Not everyone is in it for themselves, and we do want to make a difference. I think it upsets me because it is just so wrong. I am privileged to work with some of the most dedicated, hardworking people in this place that I have ever worked with across my working life. Emma McBride, the member for Dobell, is a wonderful example of this. As, indeed, are the member for Fremantle and the member for Bean, who joins me in the—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SWANSON:</span>
                    </a>  I'm just getting to that, Member for Fisher. We all come from different places across this country and some of the most dedicated, hardworking people come from all of the parties in this place. We come to this place to make a difference at your place, at home, and we want to represent our homes as best we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary opportunity to get to this place. As the great philosopher himself, John Denver, said, 'Some days are diamonds, and some days are stones.' But when you get something great over the line, like turning your local little airport in Newcastle into a serious international airport, with all the jobs and opportunities it brings, that's pretty amazing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SWANSON:</span>
                    </a>  Of course! The member for Riverina! All I could think was 'Wagga'. I want to pick up on that. I do want to specifically mention the member for Riverina when I talk about the Newcastle Airport because, in achieving the Newcastle Airport becoming an international airport, I do have to a debt of gratitude to the member for Riverina because he was most helpful. And that underlines what I said a moment ago: there are good people in this place, from all sides, who come here to make a real difference. We can work together, and we do work together, to make things better. I do cite that important example of making the Newcastle Airport an international airport, and I thank the member for Riverina for helping me do that in my previous term, when I was in opposition and he was in government. It is pretty amazing when you can get those things across the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are a few in this place—and thankfully only a few—who take the opportunity to enhance themselves before their community and forget the role we are here to perform as elected representatives. The backroom manoeuvring, the shady number deals, the promises of promotion become the focus of these Machiavellian imposters. Sadly, we did see our former Prime Minister move his way into his party by killing off his local opponent in a preselection in one of the most unethical ways that many people said they'd ever seen. We saw him make his way to the ministry, wreaking havoc through human services and terrorising the immigration sector. He made his way into the powerful role of Treasurer. And we all remember the member for Cook putting his arm around the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, and stating that he was 'ambitious for him'. We all know how that turned out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that no one man can find himself in the Prime Minister's office without the support of his colleagues. Some of the faithful servants of the previous Prime Minister remain in this place. The former member for Tangney was not so fortunate to remain in this place. He paid the ultimate price. The people of Tangney had had enough. The problem for the member for Cook is that the former member of Tangney will continue to be one of his closest allies. Some of the people that remain in this House must still have some mistrust. Sadly, when you appoint yourself to multiple roles under the cover of darkness that is what really causes distrust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the Morrison government was all about the lights, the clicks, the stunts. It is novel, but, let me tell you, this place isn't a game. Whilst we all occasionally ham it up for the cameras, and we all take social media to the next level, this is a serious business and it should be treated as such. The lives of Australians deserve the same gravitas that we like to think we give ourselves in this place. Each and every one of us makes decisions, creates policies, votes on legislation and takes on responsibilities that affect the lives of the Australian people. That is what we are here for and it is what we should be doing. Good government is what is expected by the Australian people, and when the government is failing them all the social media in the world means nought when your people are hurting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often said that governments lose elections and oppositions do not win. That certainly has credibility. The last election came down to trust, and the people made it clear that they could no longer trust Mr Morrison. He had lied to them once too often, promised a future that only served a few and was embarrassing our nation across the world. When the President of France confirmed that the former Prime Minister lied to him, and that he knew it, there was no doubt that Australia was no longer a country that could be relied upon. There was no trust. That is a terrible indictment on us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The now elected Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, I'm pleased to say, is the opposite. No matter how busy his schedule, he is back home in Grayndler as much as he can be. He knows what's happening in his patch, and he is always working for it. He has a strong sense of loyalty and is a man of his word. He's articulate. He's not a code-hopper; he's backed the same team all his life. He never forgets why he is here and why we are all here. He is a man of integrity, and his leadership team—the Deputy Minister, Richard Marles, and the Senate team, led by Penny Wong and Don Farrell—are people of integrity. Our Treasurer is an experienced economist, with the credentials to back it up. The Attorney-General—well, let's just say: national integrity commission, done!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated before, this is a tough business. They say, 'If you want a friend in politics, get a dog.' This hasn't been my experience in the Labor caucus. I've forged real friendships based on mutual interest and respect, and I know my leader is always honest with me. I don't know how you do this job when you can't trust your boss to be frank with you. The remaining members of the coalition that now sit opposite me could not trust their boss. Rumours of bullying and deception travelled these corridors on a daily basis. The country was not being governed; it was barely being managed, to be frank with you. The icing on the cake, the finding of the Solicitor-General, made it clear that an inquiry into the member for Cook's conduct was overdue. Let me repeat that—an inquiry into the former Prime Minister's conduct. It was an extraordinary time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advice of the Solicitor-General was damning. Between March 2020 and May 2021, the member was Cook was appointed by the Governor-General to administer no less than five departments: Health; Finance; Industry, Science, Energy and Resources; Treasury; and Home Affairs. These are your big-ticket items here in parliament, and the actual ministers appointed had no idea—not a clue. His cabinet had no idea. It turns out the former member for Tangney knew; he got the secret prize of Home Affairs. Who else that remains in this place knew that the leader of the coalition was misleading his cabinet, misleading his party room and, most importantly, misleading the Australian people? He said that it was because of the extraordinary times and that the pandemic created the obstacles where, indeed, this was justified. I say to you: there are no circumstances that justify deception. They were indeed extraordinary times, and if indeed it was so necessary for him to take on those additional roles the people of Australia would have understood. He should have been straight with us. He should have been straight with his own people. Sadly, that was not the case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, and I do so because I believe a primary role of this parliament and of government is to be accountable, transparent and honest with the people we are elected to serve. It might once have been fair to assume that the amendment before us would not be necessary. Those who drafted the original legislation would probably have never imagined the need to spell out the requirement for formal notification of any changes to the Federal Executive Council. Ministerial responsibility for crucial areas of public policy and administration is usually something that is universally understood as a matter of importance and in the public interest to know. But these so-called shared assumptions about how democratic governments are meant to function were suddenly no longer shared under the previous government, as we have seen and discovered. What we now know is that because of the actions of the member for Cook in the dying days of the government he led, this amendment is now indeed necessary. As we know, the member for Cook had himself installed as the minister for five departments, without bothering to tell the nation what he was doing—nor his ministerial colleagues, for that matter. It would seem that he didn't even bother to tell the sworn ministers that he had taken over their portfolios. Apparently being the Prime Minister and being responsible for administering the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wasn't enough for him. He decided to also avail himself and appoint himself as minister for health, finance, industry, science, energy and resources, the Treasury and Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Edelman Trust survey revealed that Australians have an alarmingly reduced level of trust in their governments. According to this annual survey, the level of trust Australians had in government had dropped quite significantly on the international trustworthiness index and was now below 50 per cent. It's no wonder that the Australian people have trouble trusting government, when the leader of the previous government clearly couldn't even trust his own ministers—so much so, that he decided to do their jobs form them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is necessary, because we need to rebuild trust in the integrity of government. There are many ways we can do this. We can do it by keeping our promises; by being honest and open about the challenges we face; through maintaining a practical commitment to fairness and equity in our policies and programs; through encouraging frank and fearless advice from the public service; and through spending public money wisely and in the national interest, rather than on securing votes in marginal seats. In many, if not all, of these areas the previous government managed to slowly erode more and more of the Australian people's trust. We on this side are committed to rebuilding that trust through honest leadership and with integrity. But for now, let us focus on the issue of transparency, because that's what this amendment seeks to enshrine when it comes to ministerial responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The hospital system in Western Australia is in crisis. As the member for Canning, I have a duty to speak up for the people of my electorate, particularly when Labor's failure to manage the healthcare system is putting lives at risk. Today I rise for the seventh time in this place to call on the WA Premier, Mark McGowan, to do his job and fix our hospital system. First, I want to make clear that my concerns are not with our doctors, our nurses or our hospital staff. They do an incredible job, often in difficult circumstances. My concerns are with Labor's mismanagement, which is leading to bed shortages, ambulance ramping and unacceptable waiting times. Our health system is in a crisis after six years of Labor state government. I have been campaigning for years with the community for WA Labor to deliver upgrades to the Peel Health Campus, my region's primary hospital. Since speaking up, northern residents of Canning have shared their concerns about Armadale hospital. My constituents cannot wait any longer while Labor sits on its hands. It's time for the Premier, Mark McGowan, and the four state Labor MPs in the Peel region, who were elected to represent us, to fix our healthcare system. Our doctors and nurses are the best in the world, but they need resources and the system management to provide the best possible care to our community. Mark McGowan and WA Labor have let us down, and I won't stop speaking for my constituents until we see action.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  A recent ANU study found that people are three times more likely to take up smoking if they've tried vaping. Three times—that's a scary number. After Labor governments have put in so much work to reduce rates of smoking, from banning advertising to plain packaging, to let vaping go unchecked now could undo a lot of that hard work. It's obvious vaping is being driven by big tobacco to try and increase smoking and drive up profits.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cynically, it's targeting young people with flavoured vapes and funky designs, such as looking like highlighters you can put in your pencil case and having unicorns on them. All sensible people know that government should do something. However, the Nationals propose letting people flog vapes in every supermarket in Australia. It's said that where there's smoke, there's fire, but where there's nicotine, there are the Nationals. The Nationals Party is still taking donations from big tobacco. Did this policy come directly from the tobacco lobbyists who want more kids hooked on their products? When Greg Hunt tried to do something to place import controls on vapes, he got rolled by those opposite, surely led by the tobacco funded Nationals. I support Minister Butler's move to work with the states to put a stop to kids taking up vaping because, unlike the Nationals, I don't want to see a rise in smoking rates and the disastrous consequences this has on the health of Australians and the pressures on our health systems. Talk to your local schools and you will find that vaping is taking place in every toilet in every school. We need to stop this.</span>

In the heart of my electorate at Castle Hill, this campus is offering state-of-the-art facilities, including study space, equipment, simulation labs and clinical training places. It is providing students with hands-on learning experience in vital fields such as nursing and health related fields, including a masters of nursing degree. This is an important facility in Western Sydney. As someone who's grown up in Western Sydney his whole life, I know we have world-class universities like the University of Western Sydney and Macquarie University. That the University of Canberra has opened a campus in my electorate and has that great offering for the enormous amount of young people coming through our schooling system is a real asset for my electorate of Mitchell. It's right next to the Metro line, which the state government invested in over many years, meaning that there are great transport links. It's well located. It has greatly experienced staff who have already set up, and it was a pleasure to meet not only the international students who have already started there but also the domestic students considering, and now studying, a career in nursing.</span>

The health and social assistance sector is the second-largest employer in industry-terms inside my electorate. I really want to thank the University of Canberra for a great and foresighted investment in our young people with this great nursing offering in my electorate of Mitchell.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On Sunday night at Darwin's Airport Tavern, 20-year-old Declan Laverty was finishing his shift when a 19-year-old customer allegedly stabbed him. Declan texted his parents, 'Love you, being stabbed,' before he died at the scene. Declan's senseless killing has rocked the Northern Territory. It is an unimaginable tragedy. No-one ever expects to go to work to face violence but many do. No-one deserves to lose their life this way. As Declan's mother said, 'He will never fall in love. He will never marry. He will never be a dad. His life, his future, our future, have been completely stripped away.' My deepest condolences to Declan's family and loved ones.</span>

Alcohol-fuelled violence has been and is a problem in the Northern Territory. I commend the Northern Territory government for the announced changes to bail laws and weapons offences yesterday. Improvements to security at licensed premises are essential to ensure the safety of workers. The whole Northern Territory community needs to have a serious conversation about alcohol and crime, and about how we can all work together to do our bit to keep the community safe. May Declan Laverty rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Since the days of the gold rush, the communities of the Central West of New South Wales have been advocating for a new crossing over the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point between Mudgee and Orange. At the moment it takes about two hours and 20 minutes to drive between the two, but the most direct route is via Dixons Long Point. With no crossing, the only way through is straight through the water. An improved road and crossing at Dixons Long Point would drastically reduce the travel time between Orange and Mudgee. It would provide access to vehicles all year round, withstand flood events and improve connectivity between the Central West and Hunter Valley regions, which would drive economic growth and tourism in the area. We could have used it during the recent bushfires.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Substantial funding had been committed under the Roads of Strategic Importance program by the previous government. Geotech work had been carried out, and the project was even put out to tender. Together, with local Indigenous groups, we cooperatively and respectfully worked through cultural heritage concerns and addressed them to find a way forward, and there was still $27.8 million in fully allocated funding sitting there in that kitty to get the project moving. Where is it now? Why can't any of it be used? One hundred and seventy years is a long time to wait for this crossing. I urge the government to back this game-changing project for our region. Get behind Dixons Long Point.</span>

They came to raise awareness of the need for a rail link between Ipswich CBD and Springfield, to the east of the fastest-growing city in Queensland. The Albanese Labor government is committing $3.4 million towards the business case. The rail corridor will service the fast-growing multicultural communities along the proposed route and ensure homes in the many greenfield sites are more affordable and attractive. It will link the Ipswich and Springfield campuses of the University of Southern Queensland and the Ipswich showgrounds. Without the rail corridor, the cost of congestion will go from $500 million to one billion dollars a year by 2036, with the average commute to Brisbane 2.5 hours.</span>

The successful election result enabled an incredible significantly experienced volunteer team to come together to develop a fully fledged strategy and plan to assist our community in achieving and establishing this goal. To everyone involved in that team: please know that the wider community and I will be forever grateful for both your commitment and the work that you have done in this area.</span>

Taking place at Norths leagues club from 10 am, the free event will be family friendly and will include some fantastic speakers; interactive and interesting exhibitions, including electric bikes and vehicles; and even face painting for anyone who would like it. I give special thanks to the teams at Smart Energy Council, Norths leagues club and the local councils that have worked with us, hand in hand, to make this event possible. It is certain to be a fantastic day, and I look forward to seeing our community make this transition quickly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  On Sunday 12 March, I represented the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at Guildford, in my electorate of Hasluck, to commemorate the 10th Light Horse Regiment with the unveiling of an emotionally charged statue of a soldier with his trusty steed, guiding the horse through knee-deep mud. The 10th Light Horse was raised in Guildford in 1914. It was the only light horse regiment recruited in Western Australia in the First World War and became one of Australia's best known and most effective regiments. The regiment was sent to Gallipoli, via Egypt, and used mainly in a defensive role until the August offensive. We can only wonder at the bonds between the soldiers and their horses and the suffering that both endured together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unveiling ceremony was well attended by dignitaries from the miliary, all levels of government, businesses and local residents. Guests included the Chair of the Australian War Memorial, the Hon. Kim Beazley, and even Nicholas Hasluck, the son of Sir Paul and Dame Alexandra Hasluck, for whom the electorate of Hasluck is named. I have a particular attachment to the regiment, as my own father, Peter Lawrence, who's here in the gallery today, was a member of the 10th Light Horse between 1962 and 1968. I pay my respects to all members of the regiment, both former and serving. I congratulate the artist, Dr Charles Robb, and the Guildford Light Horse Statue Committee for their efforts. I know the project went through some difficult times, but it was worth the effort. Stirling Square will now commemorate the efforts and service of our veterans, and the animals which served our nation.</span>

Coeliac disease affects approximately one in 70 Australians, making it one of the most common autoimmune diseases. It is also one of Australia's most under-recognised medical conditions. If you have coeliac disease, your immune system's response to gluten causes damage to the small intestine, causing in many cases quite serious medical conditions. My eldest daughter, Bridget, was severely anaemic before her diagnosis. The only treatment currently available is a completely gluten-free diet. This means households like ours have completely separate cooking implements and boards and have to be exceptionally vigilant so as not to contaminate a coeliac's food. Fortunately, there are now many businesses that cater for coeliacs, and I note PJ's Country Fruit &amp; Veg in Lismore, which has a complete section of products for the coeliac community. Coeliac Australia is a charity that works to support Australians with the disease. I thank them for the work they do. Coeliac Awareness Week is 13 to 20 March this year. It aims to raise awareness about the disease itself and how often it can be undiagnosed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  BAPS is a global socio-spiritual and volunteer-driven organisation with a commitment to empowering individuals to engage in projects that improve the community, country and world. I have had the honour of being a part of BAPS activities many times, particularly with their Melbourne South branch. Most recently, I commemorated International Women's Day with them. Their women's conference, with the theme Make It Happen, served as a platform to bring women together to discuss various methods of overcoming obstacles faced during the pursuit of our goals. They organised a play that focused on ways to seize opportunities to accomplish our ambitions. One of their beautiful performances was of the twins, Sidthi and Ridthi, and how they use time differently in life.</span>

I am proud to represent organisations like BAPS as the federal member for Holt. Their vision to ensure a harmonious society by promoting their culture through volunteering and service is commendable. Thank you so much for having me and thank you for the lovely sweets. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Today there are more than 135,000 Australians that are currently living with blood cancer, and sadly one in three of those people will have lost their cancer battle within five years of diagnosis. Blood cancers are the second most common cause of cancer death. This is why the World's Greatest Shave campaign exists, to send a powerful message of hope and relief to those affected by this terrible disease. I recently attended Grace Lutheran College in Rothwell in the Petrie electorate to attend their annual World's Greatest Shave fundraising event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2009 the Grace community have raised a whopping $378,516 for the Leukaemia Foundation. Televised by Channel Nine's Today show, 42 high school students and teachers lined up on St Patrick's Day, last Friday, to shave their heads in support of those living with leukaemia, with numerous others donating a gold coin to colour their hair and local hairdressers donating their time for a worthy cause. The highest fundraisers of the day were students Fraser and Declan, who each raised over $3,000, and Nicholas, who raised over $2,000. I met a young woman, Taleah, who voluntarily cut off her lower-back-length ponytail and shaved her head. She raised over $1,600. I want to highlight Kylie Duyzer, the principal, who let me colour her hair. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  There once was a premier called Perrottet. To privatise stuff was his only play. As hard as he tried, the impulse he couldn't hide, and he sold every one of our assets away. The New South Wales state election is upon us, and the choice could not be more clear. On the one hand, you have the coalition government which, after almost 12 years in power, are about as old and tired as they come. It's a coalition government which keeps the wages of our essential workers down—nurses, teachers, our ambos, the ones who got us through the pandemic. None of them deserved a pay rise, according to Premier Perrottet and his coalition government. It's a government who will, frankly, privatise anything with a pulse. </span>

They will create a publicly owned clean energy corporation to expand investment in renewable energy and put downward pressure on power prices. The Minns Labor team will protect public ownership of Sydney Water and Hunter Water by putting it in the New South Wales constitution. A Minns Labor team will remove the wages cap that has kept the wages of our essential workers low for too long. The choice is clear: on Saturday, vote 1 Labor. </span>

Of course, reference to the executive and interpretation by the High Court as to what 'consultation' means will mean the capacity for oversight of virtually all legislation. The definition of 'consultation' is something that other cabinet ministers don't have. They can't take something to the High Court because they haven't been consulted enough, but the Voice will. When the definition of the Voice happens, it will not be by the parliament and in equal proportion. It will be by the Labor Party and the Greens. They will define the Voice. Right now, we know the Solicitor-General has information and they won't release it. We hear the sort of attitude they have—the sort of belligerent attitude they have—where they will be belligerent and try to charge us with guilt and screaming, rather than in a debate. And I say this: if they don't trust you with the details, do not trust them with your vote. It is not racist to vote no, and bullying and guilt are going to be the attributes of those trying to debate this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Saturday the people of New South Wales will go to the polls, and across the Hunter and Upper Hunter I want them to think about these names: Clayton Barr, Kate Washington, Jenny Aitchison, Sonia Hornery, Tim Crakanthorp, and Peree Watson. These are our candidates across the Hunter, and they are fighting for your schools, your hospitals and, importantly, regional roads. Kate Washington is fighting for a new high school at Medowie. Clayton Barr is fighting for a new high school at Huntlee. At Maitland Hospital, we know the wait times have been atrocious under this New South Wales government. We are fighting for more staff at Maitland Hospital. Thank you, Jenny Aitchison, for that. You wouldn't get a better local member than Sonia Hornery, and Tim Crakanthorp has fought tooth and nail for a container terminal at Newcastle port. We know that he is putting his money where his mouth is when it comes to Newcastle. Thanks for that, Tim.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a fantastic team, but the one I want to highlight to you today belongs to the electorate of my good friend and neighbour Dan Repacholi. It's Peree Watson in the Upper Hunter. Give her your No. 1 this Saturday. She is dynamic and new. She's not tired like some of those Nationals in the Upper Hunter. Give her your vote. She'll work hard for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Every Australian has a right to go to work and feel safe. It goes without saying that this is the expected norm for every workplace right across the country. Yet workers at the Carmichael Mine in my electorate of Capricornia have been faced with physical and verbal abuse from a group of anti-coal activists whose beliefs are of utter contempt for the laws which have upheld our great country for over a century. For 18 months these activists have been terrorising workers with physical harm while boasting online of their altercations. I wholeheartedly believe in free speech. This is what makes our country what it is, and it's something that we see in action every day in parliament. These extreme activists hold dangerous anti-government and anti-authority ideologies which are a significant threat to our society. The laws should be applied equally, without fear or favour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Extreme activists are no strangers to me. Late last year, I too was targeted by activists who are also linked to this group. At an event I was attending, these activists were verbally abusive while shaking their spears. It left me fearing not only for my safety but for the safety of my staff also. Again, in our place of work we felt fear. We felt terrorised by a group of people who show no respect for anyone's views that do not align with their own. More needs to be done by the government to hold these people accountable for their actions and ensure that people feel safe in their place of work. These people are not above the law and should be dealt with by the full force of the law. Everyone should be safe in the workplace.</span>

This is what we all want. We want a fresh start in the state. We want to make sure that we're doing best. We want teachers. We want high schools. We want nurses. We want hospitals. We want fire brigades and stations. We want ambulances. We want the support of everyone who has been rorted over the last 12 years by a wasted government.</span>

Peree Watson is going up against a tired old Nationals Upper Hunter member in that area. He's new to the seat, but he's a bit quiet in that seat, I can tell you. Peree Watson—what an absolute legend of a lady: Peree '23. Peree will get there, and Peree will help us get over the line. Then we have our fantastic candidate Steve Ryan down at Lake Macquarie. We need Steve to push hard as he is continuing to do. I've been out doorknocking with both of these amazing candidates, and I wish them luck in the New South Wales state election. Go Labor!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I am, indeed. I have with me the inaugural NRL Pacific Showcase trophy, from the touch football game on Tuesday! It was played in very good spirits. It will go on to be an annual event. I want to give a shout-out to Jess Goddard from the NRL. It was her birthday on Tuesday and she spent it—before dawn—setting up the Senate oval so we could all have a game. JBR and the team did a fantastic job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, it was about the people-to-people links between us and our good friends in the Pacific, and continuing to build on that good faith, by a game of touch football and through sport. So a big shout-out to Petero Civoniceva—whose name I still can't pronounce correctly. Elsie Albert, who played on one of the sides, is the first Papua New Guinean to play in the NRLW, and she's a fantastic ambassador for rugby league amongst women across the country. Sia Soliola, from Samoa, is another female athlete playing in the NRLW. It's great to have her there. She had some serious wheels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To everyone who played and took part, it was a great event. But a special shout-out to the member for Nicholls, Sam Birrell, who was named player of the match. I could count the number of touch football games on one hand that he's played: State of Origin, three trials, the Pacific Showcase—I expect he'll play for Australia next.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  This Saturday, the people of New South Wales will vote for a new government. To assist the House I thought I'd remind them of all the scandals that have riddled the current Liberal opposition, when in government, who have well passed their use-by date. You Liberals are lucky I only have 90 seconds! I simply cannot cover every scandal, every rort, that's happened over the last 12 years, so here's just a sample of scandal, an amuse-bouche of transgression, if you will. Here we go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premiers O'Farrell and Berejiklian resigned after a scandal before ICAC. Damien Tudehope, former Liberal leader in the upper house had shares in Transurban, all of which are part of a government that privatised Sydney's roads to—you guessed it—Transurban. Dodgy Daryl Maguire was investigated by ICAC for his property dealings, charged by police for conspiracy for his part in a corrupt visa scheme. John 'Pork' Barilaro—I could spend 30 minutes on him alone. He politicised disaster funding grants excluding the fire ravaged Blue Mountains from a $100 million fund and then tried to score himself a half-a-million-dollar job to go to New York City. Liberal members of parliament Edwards, Owen, Cornwell and Webber all admitted to receiving illegal donations. We've had coalition ministers sacked from the ministry for Islamophobic and anti-vax jokes, and I could go on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New South Wales has an amazing record of booting out rotten governments—and they got it right when they kicked you lot out last year—and they're going to kick the Liberals out this year. This Saturday, vote for Lyndal Howison, Donna Davis, Chris Minns and Labor for a fresh start in New South Wales. </span>

This is truly a really great day for this nation. Last night the Senate passed the referendum machinery bill with bipartisan support, and just a few hours ago the Prime Minister announced the wording of the constitutional amendment and the question that will be put to Australians at the referendum. That question is:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six years ago, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people met at Uluru. The Statement from the Heart was the largest-ever First Nations consensus on a way forward for this country. There were 12 regional dialogues with more than 1,200 representatives—grassroots, bottom-up, not top-down. The Statement from the Heart is an invitation to walk together in a movement of the Australian people for a better future, to create constitutional reform so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can take our rightful place in the Constitution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a rigorous and comprehensive process. The Australian people can be confident the work has been done to ensure a voice that works, a voice that makes a practical difference, a voice that is not another layer of bureaucracy but will hold bureaucracy to account, a voice that will move Australia forward for everyone.</span>

Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, said this about the impact, on an ongoing basis, of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: 'The high inflation that we're currently experiencing is one of the legacies of the pandemic and of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.' That is what Philip Lowe said. That's what everyone here knows is a fact. Those opposite pretend that that hasn't been the case. This has had a global impact on energy prices. We are not immune to that because of the fact that the opposition's policies led to our exposure. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The provisions that we released today will enshrine two fundamental principles: recognition and consultation. It will do it in a way that absolutely minimises any risk of any non-considered issues.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something we released in July, in a speech I gave at the Garma Festival. Since then, we've consulted with the Referendum Working Group, and I thank them for their work. Since then, we've also had a legal group advising the Referendum Working Group. Why do we need this to happen? It's because we urgently need better outcomes. We have a 10-year-gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is twice as high as that of non-Indigenous Australians. We have tragic levels of child mortality and disease. We have a massive over-representation in incarceration rates—per capita, the highest rate of any segment of the population that you can look at in the world. We need to do better. It's not because of a shortage of good intentions on both sides of this chamber. Today Ken Wyatt was proudly standing there next to me in the Blue Room for this announcement. He was, of course, Australia's first Indigenous person to hold the high office that he did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments have tried to impose solutions from Canberra. What this is about is doing things with Indigenous Australians, not to them or for them. That's why the Referendum Working Group process was so important. This presents every Australian with a historic democratic opportunity. We will give them that opportunity between October and December. If this is successful, this will be an inspiring and unifying Australian moment. It will be important in giving respect to First Nations people, but it will also be important to the way that we as non-Indigenous Australians see ourselves and see our nation as well, as we recognise the great privilege that we have of sharing this great island continent with the oldest continuous culture on earth. That should be recognised in our nation's 'birth certificate'. What Indigenous Australians are asking is that that that be done in a way which gives them a voice and which allows them to be consulted on matters that affect them. It's as simple as that: recognition and consultation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge Australians to examine the words that have been put forward, to look at the Uluru Statement from the Heart and vote yes for a better future for this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:20</span>):  I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in this issue and her engagement. As the honourable member knows, the safeguard mechanism covers 215 existing facilities and will cover any facility that is new, of any type, which emits more than 100,000 tonnes of emissions each year. Indeed, that is part of the opportunity and the challenge of getting the policy design right, because it is important to capture every single facility, old and new, of varying types. And it is important to ensure that there is a framework in place for emissions reduction. I don't care whether it's an old facility, a longstanding existing facility or a new facility, of any type. It is also important to reflect the complexity of the different types and the types of abatement that are possible—and the honourable member refers to this. As I said yesterday in the House, some facilities have on-site abatement technology available to them now; others do not. Others have it emerging at different rates, and that's why the use of offsets is very important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to how new entrants are treated, I'd just make this point. At the moment, the emissions from facilities that are projected to join would be around 38 million tonnes. We can reduce that very, very substantially. If the reforms pass, there will be a constraint on emissions from new facilities. If the reforms don't pass, there will be no constraints on emissions from new facilities—or old facilities. That's the choice before the parliament next week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to design elements, I look forward to updating the public and the House and the Senate with the revised regulation. I said, when I released the draft on 9 January, that I would take advice and consult. There has been nine months of consultation, two different consultation papers, many hundreds of submissions and many, many meetings, including as late as today, between me and various industry groups. I look forward to that advice being reflected in the updated regulation, and I look forward to that regulation receiving the support of the crossbench and people of good faith across the parliament.</span>

Last week's AUKUS announcement—indeed, the advancement of AUKUS—has clearly been very positive for our relationship with the United States and the United Kingdom. It has taken two of our deepest relationships to a new level. But it's important to understand what AUKUS is. AUKUS is not a collective, exclusive security pact. Australia's alliance with the United States is embodied in the ANZUS Treaty, not AUKUS. We have a long history of military engagement with Great Britain, but that stands quite aside from AUKUS. AUKUS is a hugely powerful technology-sharing arrangement between our three countries, the most significant part of which is to have the UK and the US working together to share the technology with Australia to operate a nuclear powered submarine. But that capability is all about our relationship with our region. Operating a nuclear powered submarine will be Australia's contribution to the collective security of the neighbourhood in which we live. As such, it stands to improve our relationship with our neighbours. And this is the message—with over 60 calls from the Prime Minister, me, the foreign minister, the minister for the Pacific to leaders in north-east Asia, in South-East Asia and the Pacific—that we gave. The response from our region to the announcement that we made last week has been gratifying. Fiji's Prime Minister Rabuka has expressed his support for the AUKUS agreement. Samoa's Prime Minister, Fiame, who was here yesterday, said she, understands Australia's rationale for acquiring nuclear powered submarines. Indonesia, in respect of AUKUS, said:</span>

It's all I can do to get a question from the shadow treasurer, Mr Speaker. I acknowledge, as you did, Mr Speaker, the delegations from Townsville and Brisbane, and say particularly to the group from Townsville how much I enjoyed catching up with them through the course of the week. My advice to the shadow treasurer is to get on the blower to Kim and explain to Kim why when the shadow treasurer and all of those members over there had the opportunity to vote for a little bit of help when it came to a higher energy bills they left them hanging. Those opposite completely abandoned the people in every suburb of this country and every small business which will be eligible for the energy bill relief that was passed through this parliament no thanks to those opposite.</span>

We have been engaging with APRA, ASIC, the RBA, Treasury and the banks, and their advice is that our institutions are well capitalised and well regulated, and that we are well placed to deal with the volatility that is coming at us. What we're seeing on global markets is feeding into some uncertainty in the global economy, which is now tempering some of the slightly more upbeat forecasts that we had been seeing for the advanced economies.</span>

At a time when the medium-term pressures on our budget are intensifying rather than easing, and when our predecessors left key programs, like the My Health Record program, completely unfunded beyond the middle of this year, it's more important than ever that this is a responsible budget in May. It will build on the substantial restraint we showed in October as well.</span>

                  </a>  That restraint that was showed in October is best represented by the fact that we returned 99 per cent for two years of the upward revenue revisions. The previous government averaged 40 per cent and the Howard government averaged 30 per cent. We had payments falling in real terms over the next two years; the previous government averaged 2.6 per cent real spending growth before the pandemic. We had payments growing in nominal terms by an average annual rate of 4.3 compared to 5.9 under our predecessors. Most importantly, we found $22 billion in savings in the March budget.</span>

                  </a>  The last budget from those opposite delivered precisely zero dollars in savings. That's the sort of restraint that we showed in the October budget, and we'll see it again in the May budget. For all of these reasons, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made it clear in the middle of February that we aren't adding to inflationary pressures in our economy. If anything, we're actually moderating inflation with our energy price plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot going for us in this country but we have got a lot coming at us as well. The budget in May, like the budget in October, will have common elements: the combination of near-term and longer-term priorities; the best combination of relief, repair and restraint; and a premium on the quality of spending, not just the quantity of spending so that we can continue to invest in our people and their futures and clean up the mess that we were left by those opposite.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of those Australians has a story to tell, and each story is one that all of us should be listening to. Over 80 per cent of the increase in people who are homeless were women. And I want to remind members in this place and the other place that that's why, in its first five years, returns from the Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver 4,000 homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and for older women at risk of homelessness, as well as $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for these people. Sadly the data also showed that Indigenous Australians are over nine times more likely to experience homelessness. That's why returns from our Housing Australia Future Fund will provide $200 million for repairs, maintenance and improvements for housing in remote Indigenous communities.</span>

                  </a>  That answer is not one that is funny or that we should be proud of. On census night 1,555 veterans were homeless. Again, that's why returns from the Housing Australia Future Fund will provide $30 million to build housing and fund specialist services for veterans who are experiencing, or are at risk of experiencing, homelessness. As I said yesterday, of the 123,000 people, 23 per cent were young people aged 12 to 24. </span>

                  </span>The data shows that we all need to work together to do better. That's why at the last election we put to the Australian people a plan to tackle the country's housing challenges. Fundamental to our plan is increasing supply of new housing, and we are already delivering. Today homes are underway already across the country from our Housing Infrastructure Facility broadening. In our first budget, we had the National Housing Accord. We've already stood up the Interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, and work has begun on a National Housing and Homelessness Plan. We want the National Housing Accord, the National Housing and Homelessness Plan and the Housing Australia Future Fund working together, on independent advice from the interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, helping everybody work together and lifting the states and territories and putting pressure on them too to do more. Our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will be the largest boost to social and affordable housing in more than a decade. Our fund will help deliver more homes. I urge people in this place to support it, because Australians that need it most— <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

In the 10 months he's been here, he's made a wonderful contribution. Next week the parliament will have a chance to draw a line under the 10 years of delay and denial of climate policy in Australia. Next week the parliament will have a chance to send a message to people in Australia and to investors around the world that those 10 years of denial and delay are over. Next week the parliament will have a choice between delay and action—action on reducing emissions, action on encouraging investment in renewable energy and decarbonisation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asks about the consequences if we don't take that choice. The consequences will be very clear: 205 million extra tonnes of emissions in the air if we don't act. If we don't take this opportunity, the consequences would be that, instead of achieving a 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, it will be 35 per cent. These are the consequences of not acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of continuing with 10 years of dysfunction would be that the world will get a mixed message from our country. This parliament sent the world a message last year that we have one energy policy, one climate change policy, that's enshrined in the law of the land. Now is the time to implement this, and the key is attracting investment to decarbonise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been strong support for our policy from people who want to invest in our decarbonisation. Rebecca Mikula-Wright, the CEO of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said 'Policy uncertainty has been the biggest handbrake for long-term investors who are ready to invest in economy-wide decarbonisation.' Or Kristy Graham, the CEO of the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute, said of the safeguard mechanism's reforms, 'It'll provide an important signal to international investors, lenders and insurers that Australian climate policy is continuing to strengthen and enable Australia to attract capital to support the climate transition.' And that's what it's all about. Investment equals jobs. Capital equals jobs. But capital craves policy certainty. Capital craves policy stability. That's what this government is giving the Australian people and investors from around the world. That's what we invite the parliament to join with us in providing—in providing that stability and certainty of a framework for investment right throughout our regions in Australia's big industries, who can decarbonise and be world-leading in a decarbonising world. That is what is at stake in this parliament next week. The chance to give Australian industry and Australian workers that opportunity. I'm confident. I believe that parliament can and will seize that opportunity and not squander it.</span>

Prime Minister, you have said you support the $2.7 billion Gabba demolition and rebuild, which will see the destruction of a local public school and park and the resuming of homes. Why did the federal government commit $3.4 billion to the Olympics without first demanding the Queensland government drop the destructive Gabba demolition? Can you explain to the families of East Brisbane State School and the residents of Kangaroo Point why you support destroying their public school and park?</span>

We support Brisbane hosting the Olympics. We support that unapologetically, and that's why we are building a major centre. That won't just be about the Olympics, though. What the Brisbane arena will be about is giving the people of South-East Queensland and, indeed, the entire nation a venue that will be used not just for the Olympics, a venue that will be used for decades to come. That is what we're about. We're about supporting the jobs that are there in a real way. We are about making sure that we get this policy right. And, just as Melbourne continues to benefit from hosting the 1956 Games, and Sydney continues to benefit from hosting the 2000 Games, Brisbane and, indeed, the whole of Queensland will benefit, including from the 19 separate projects that we will provide funding for—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:54</span>):  I thank the most excellent member for Gilmore for her question. I want to acknowledge the extremely hard way in which the member for Gilmore works for the people that she represents in Gilmore and the families that she represents. In October 2020 the Prime Minister delivered his budget reply speech as opposition leader, in which he committed future Labor governments to making early childhood education and care more affordable. It was the most significant on-budget promise we made when in opposition, and, in our first six months in government, we've passed legislation in this House honouring that commitment. We're delivering on that commitment, we're keeping that promise and we're getting the job done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when Australian families sit down at the kitchen table and go through their household budgets, one of the first things that they have to factor in is the cost of early childhood education and care. Often that cost means that they then have to go on to work out how many hours they can work, and it often limits how many hours they can work or how many extra days they can work before that money is eaten up in early childhood education and care fees. We're fixing that, and, in just 100 days, around 1.2 million families right across Australia are going to benefit from our reforms. They can now start planning for the meaningful and ongoing cost-of-living relief that will hit their pockets from 1 July. For the average family on about $120,000 a year with a child in care three days a week, our changes will save them $1,700 a year. That's going to make a huge difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms aren't just about affordability. They will also ensure that children across Australia will benefit from the transformational effects of early learning. The research tells us this, and we know this. I've said before that children will be the main beneficiaries of our reforms, and it's true. This is an investment not just in the future of our country, not just in our economy, but in the future of Australian children, something I know that every member in this House is committed to. More Australian children will have access to the health and education benefits in those foundational years of learning, no matter what their background is, no matter who their parents are, no matter what their postcode is, no matter where they live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government, which delivers on our promises and puts Australian families first. We're taking meaningful action on the cost of living, giving real and responsible relief to families, and our reforms will deliver just that. </span>

We have had very high coal and gas prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the pandemic.' She went on to say, 'We've also seen a number of outages, in particular at old coal plants,' and that was a result of natural disasters having an impact. She went on to say: 'The proposed increase to the default market offer is much, much lower than it would have otherwise been. Forward contract prices for 2023-24 have fallen substantially since governments began discussing possible interventions in gas and coal markets in October 2022.' </span>

In 100 days time, child care will get a lot cheaper for more than one million Australian families. We are on the cusp of real cost-of-living relief for more than a million Australian families. Child care is expensive; ask any mum or dad with children in care and they'll tell you that. They'll tell you it's essential. They'll tell you they need it. They'll tell you that the cost is going up and up and up. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I told the parliament, when I introduced the cheaper childcare legislation last year, that the cost of child care had gone up by 41 per cent under the Liberal-National government over the last eight years. But I've made a blue. I've got it wrong. I may have accidentally misled the House, because information released today now tells us that the cost of child care under the former government went up not by 41 per cent but by 49 per cent. That's their record. That's why what we promised is so important, what we're doing is so important and what we're delivering is so important. It's why the Prime Minister made this the first policy that he announced in his budget reply speech, and why we all campaigned for it, right across the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about the reaction of families to the policy that we took to the last election. There are lots of reasons why families voted the way they did in May last year. There are lots of reasons why families in those formerly safe seats of Liberal legends like Menzies, Turnbull, Abbott and Frydenberg voted the way they did, and why these are no longer Liberal seats, why they're crossbench seats up there; or why the seats of Howard and Costello are now over here, behind me. But this is one of them. Our cheaper childcare policy is one of them. It starts in 100 days. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a family on a combined income of $120,000, with one child in care for three days a week, it'll mean that they'll save $1,700 per year. That's real money that will make a real difference. It means more kids getting access to quality early learning and care. It means that it'll be cheaper for their parents. It'll mean that more parents, particularly more mums, will be able to get back to paid work if they want to. That's why I say this is good for children, it's good for parents, and it's good for our economy. It's only 100 days away. </span>

Of course, on this side, we share her concerns. We know that the IPCC report is important, and it's important that we take note of its implications globally. Australia certainly has to do its share to make sure we get to a net zero planet for our kids and our grandkids, for human beings and for nature. I thank her for her question, and I reassure her that we take her concerns seriously. We need to put Australia on a new path, a new path towards a renewable energy future. We believe that. That's why we're doing it. That's why the best and most-important thing we can do as a parliament is to pass the safeguard mechanism so we can get to net zero.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite spent almost a decade in denial. If they had acted when they could have, we would be a lot further down the path towards a decarbonised future than we now are. They had 22 separate energy policies. The only place they actually overachieved was in coming up with energy policies. Sadly, they didn't land a single one. We on this side are boosting renewables as a share of our electricity grid to 82 per cent. As the minister says, 82 per cent in 82 months—that is a huge achievement. There is $20 billion for Rewiring the Nation and six new renewable energy zones in Newcastle, the Illawarra, Gippsland, Bass Strait, Bunbury and western Victoria. We are changing our environmental laws so that we can get these new renewable projects through the pipeline more quickly.</span>

                  </a>  We are supporting electric cars. We have signed the methane pledge. We have passed laws to protect the ozone layer. Decarbonising Australia is a massive job, but we are getting on with that job by constructing new renewable energy projects, by upgrading our poles and wires, by transforming our grid and by getting cheaper, cleaner renewable energy into our homes and businesses. It is not just good for the environment it is actually great for energy self-reliance, as well, and if we had started this massive job nine years ago, when we could have, we would be a lot further down the track now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is a proud Labor legacy, and the Albanese government is now building on that legacy. We are getting on with the job of expanding paid parental leave, making it more flexible and making it better when it comes to shared care. We know there is more to do to improve gender equality and women's workforce participation, but so far this government is delivering. We are delivering to families right across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 100 days, working families will begin to enjoy the benefits of our changes to paid parental leave. I am pleased to update the House that, this Sunday, pre-claiming under the improved Paid Parental Leave scheme will start. It will be available for parents having a baby due from 1 July. Opening up pre-claiming is very important for expecting families. It is a great feature of the scheme because it allows families to get their applications sorted before their baby arrives. We know that raising children and managing work is a juggle for many parents. We also know that it is a time when there are bills to pay and a lot of chaos in the house, so families need to be able to get that support without any bumps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of our changes, over 180,000 families each year will benefit from a stronger, more generous Paid Parental Leave scheme that is right for the times and right for the future. Not only will more parents have access to the government payment, they will also have more flexibility in how they transition back to work, which is important for shared care so dads and parents can spend more time with their baby. We also know that when parents share care it is good for gender equality, it is good for kids and it is good for the economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  The PM reminded us this week on several occasions that it has been 10 months since this Labor government came to power. In the lead-up to the election, in the lead-up to the last 10 months, Labor made many promises and, sadly, in the space of 10 months—10 months that the Prime Minister has described as 10 pretty good months—we have seen a growing list of broken promises. We can only assume there are more to come. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure those on this side of the House remember the promise of cheaper mortgages—broken. We remember the promise of no changes to superannuation—broken. We remember the promise of lower inflation—broken. We remember the promise 'we are not touching franking credits'—broken. We remember the promise that 'industry-wide bargaining is not part of our policy'—broken. We remember the promise 'we are doing our bit to assist real wage increases'—broken. We remember the promise that they are not about raising taxes—broken. We remember the promise to cut the cost of consultants and contractors—broken. And, of course, we remember the promise of a $275 reduction in electricity prices—broken.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all broken promises from a tricky government, from a tricky Prime Minister who is incapable of showing any empathy for the real issues that Australians are facing.</span>

                  </a>  In fact, I will take that interjection because this Prime Minister wants to talk about anything—anything—except the pressures that Australians are facing in their families and in their businesses. In these last 10 months—a pretty good 10 months, he claims—we have seen interest rates rise for nine consecutive months. These are rate increases we have not seen in this country for 30 years. We have not reached these inflation levels since 1990.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Power prices are going up. We just heard the last DMO—20 per cent increases. The Prime Minister does not even know the difference between the DMO and the Victorian default market offer. He didn't know the answer to that today. He has no idea because, quite frankly, this Prime Minister does not care about the pressures Australians are facing. He does not care at all. This is not his problem. His problem is power. That is what he is interested in—getting into power and staying in power. That is all he cares about. I tell you what, he will have a problem with power in the next couple of years because there will not be a lot of it in this country, the way this government is going with electricity prices and electricity supply. We have also seen in the last 10 months increased taxes. We've seen people on double incomes asking for help from charities to put food of the table. These are families with double incomes, and they're going to charities, in my electorate and elsewhere, because they can't put food on the table. People are being forced to take second jobs to pay the bills. A record number of Australians are turning to Lifeline, and this Prime Minister seriously thinks that it's been a good 10 months under this government. How out of touch is this Prime Minister?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, interest rates have gone up nine consecutive times under this government, and this latest increase means that a person with a typical mortgage of $750,000 is paying $1,700 more a month than they were before the election. That's $20,000 a year. No wonder we have families going to Lifeline. Quite seriously, this is absolutely diabolical. It's a scary time for many Australians; that's the reality. It is a scary time for many Australians, and when asked questions on this, the Prime Minister stands up, scoffs, laughs and refuses to answer. He refuses to answer because he is an out-of-touch prime minister. The latest national accounts show it is getting much harder for Australians to make ends meet. In fact, we saw interest paid on mortgages grow by 23 per cent during the December quarter. Instead of working in tandem with the Reserve Bank to take pressure off interest rates, the government is putting all of its energy into breaking promises and taxing Australians more. That's its solution to the problem for all Australians—tax them more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the government isn't doing enough to make the Reserve Bank's job easier. Australians, as a result, are facing a full-blown cost-of-living crisis. Data from the Reserve Bank says that 54 per cent of Australians with a mortgage will see that mortgage go from a fixed rate to a flexible rate this year. It is very important for those opposite to understand—it's clear the Prime Minister doesn't understand this; I don't think he really cares—that those on fixed rates have mortgage payments now on an interest rate of 2½ per cent. That's what they're moving from, and then they are going to be moving onto a new rate which is many times that. When he is asked questions on it, the Prime Minister says, 'It's okay. It's been a pretty good 10 months.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can look at the broader cost of living. We've seen a report recently from Finder. It says that 43 per cent of consumers are stressed about their grocery costs. It says that one in three Australians have asked friends or families for financial help in the past 12 months. And this Prime Minister wants to talk about everything else, except for that pressure. A total of 87 per cent of parents have had to reduce their spending on at least one expense due to the increased cost of living. Research from Roy Morgan shows us that an estimated 1.2 million mortgage holders—that's 25 per cent of mortgage holders—were at risk of mortgage stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned Lifeline earlier, and it's worth looking in detail at the numbers here, because they've reported an increase of almost 50 per cent in requests for help. There was no empathy from the Prime Minister when he was asked questions on these issues. Canstar's research has shown that 54 per cent of Aussies are losing confidence in the ability of the government to ease cost-of-living pressures. They're giving up on the government, and why wouldn't you? They want to talk about everything else, except for this. Tragically, data from Suicide Prevention Australia shows that 46 per cent of Australians have reported feeling increased pressure as the cost-of-living pressures continue to rise—up from five per cent the previous year.</span>

The member for Cook highlighted the devastating story of Caruso's Italian, run by Rocky and Kerrin, who, due to the rising costs of doing business, have had to close their iconic small business. It was an absolutely iconic small business. And in my electorate, Kym, the owner of the fantastic Barenz—anyone who has been to Camden on multiple occasion will know Barenz—is seeing fewer and fewer customers.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GORMAN:</span>
                  </a>  It is entirely relevant, because in the last 10 months of this government we have been cleaning up the 10 years of mess that was left by those opposite, and that mess started when the Leader of the Opposition was appointed as the health minister. He offered Australia a $7 GP tax—a fundamental assault on Medicare. He tried to increase the cost of medicines by $5. And then he had his big, bright policy idea: that we would charge people when they rock up to emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was what happened in the first 10 months when the now Leader of the Opposition was in the position of health minister. No wonder one of his other achievements in his first 10 months was to be voted the worst-ever health minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can continue. Let's look at his 10 months as opposition leader. The Leader of the Opposition, in his first 10 months, couldn't even get invited to the campaign launch of the New South Wales Liberal Party. He showed his fantastic judgement in the first 10 months when he called the robodebt royal commission a 'witch-hunt', when, as it has turned out, it has exposed so much of the failure that sat underneath the Morrison-Abbott-Turnbull government. We found ourselves seeing the Leader of the Opposition defending the secret ministries. Then, when it came to whether or not there were any new policy ideas from the Leader of the Opposition, he found that he didn't even have his own policy ideas. He was still stuck with Tony Abbott's one-word policy prescription, 'no'—or, to turn it into a three-word slogan, 'no, no, no'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to wonder why we are having an MPI about the last 10 months, because, if we were to talk about the last 11 months, maybe we would also be covering things such as the secret ministries scandal, which saw the then Prime Minister, the member for Cook, holding five secret ministries. There were two secret assistant ministers, which we only found out about last week. None of them had the guts to stand up and tell us about the two secret assistant ministers operating in the Morrison government. I thought it was interesting that the shadow minister opposite didn't mention that the inflation problem started on their watch, didn't mention that interest rates started increasing on their watch and didn't mention that, when they walked out the door, they left a trillion dollars of Liberal debt for the Australian taxpayers to repay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I'm disappointed that the shadow minister is no longer here, because they also left us with a secret energy price increase. I'm fascinated by this, because what we know about the secret energy price increase is, firstly, that the shadow minister, when he was asked on 26 October last year whether he had known before the election that prices would rise, said, 'No, I didn't.' A week later, on 1 November, when he was asked if he had signed the regulation delaying notification of the price rise, he said, 'I did, as it was recommended by the industry department.' So we have someone who is lecturing the current government when his own record was one of deception, hiding things from the Australian people before an election, and then refusing after the election to even own up to it.</span>

                  </a>  I will take the interjection from those opposite, who are saying they want to hear more about what the Albanese government is doing for the people of Australia. I take that interjection. Let's look at it. We supported an increase—again, because of a choice the Australian people made—to the minimum wage. We said, 'Absolutely we support it.' Those opposite went to the election saying they didn't support an increase in the minimum wage. We have backed a pay increase for aged-care workers, 15 per cent, so that they start to get the pay they deserve for the work for which we have for far too long said, 'Thank you,' but not given them the pay that they deserve. We've cut the price of PBS medicines down to $30, saving a family with two or three scripts a month up to $450 a year, and in 100 days from today we will see child care cheaper for 1.2 million Australian families. I will contrast that with what we saw from those opposite, who proudly presided over a 49 per cent increase in the cost of child care for working families in Australia over 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, when it was clear that we needed to take urgent action because of the challenges in the energy market, we brought this parliament back on 15 December, brought legislation into this place and asked every member: did they want to vote for cheaper electricity or did they want to vote for higher energy prices? Those in the opposition voted for higher energy prices. They voted against price relief for families in their own electorates. Then they come in here with stories about their constituents, and never do they say that they have explained to those constituents or to businesses that they voted against energy price relief. They simply ignore the fact that, when they were asked to act and to do their fundamental job of voting for legislation in this place, they chose not to vote for energy price relief.</span>

As to some of the other things that have been achieved, I want to commend the work that the member for Macquarie has done in making sure that we once again value our arts and creative industries. I commend her and the minister for their work on the Revive cultural policy, a fantastic piece of work that had been missing for 10 years. We didn't have a national cultural policy. We didn't get rid of it; I don't know who did. But I'm pleased that we have a government that once again believes in making sure we have a proper cultural policy with new money.</span>

She knows it's not just about helping families with cost of living; it's about investing in our children and the productivity of our economy. She's been a leading campaigner for that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the work of the member for Lalor, as the Chief Government Whip, who has made sure so much of the government's legislative agenda when it comes to Jobs and Skills Australia, to those 20,000 university places, to legislation to open the doors of opportunity—again, people on this side are committed to making sure—</span>

He has been, in this place, time and time again, asking those opposite to back the National Reconstruction Fund so that we can once again back manufacturing in this country, as opposed to those opposite— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When you get an opportunity to talk about what your government has done in the first 10 months of its operation, you'd think you would spend some time saying with pride what you think the government has done. In that woeful performance he spent about 7½ to eight minutes having a crack at the other side—and some of it was on stuff from 10 years ago. There were some big smiles on some faces on the backbench because that was woeful.</span>

I'm going to start with one thing that is quite traumatic; I feel very strongly about this. When the Prime Minister says it's been a pretty good 10 months, it hasn't been a pretty good 10 months in those remote communities where the cashless welfare card has been removed. The cashless welfare card was having some real practical impacts on the ground. I know one of the communities quite well and have been to one of those communities quite a lot as well. Those communities were telling me they did think the cashless welfare card was working, and the stats prove it. Since that cashless welfare card has been removed from some of those remote and regional communities, domestic violence is up, child abuse is up—</span>

I will spread the information about where this meeting is at 10 o'clock on Monday morning. There are going to be community members from these communities who will tell their stories, and I will invite you to come. It will be interesting to see which of you members do turn up to that who don't believe what's been going on in these communities. Again, I think the blind ideology that you have had about that card has caused great distress in those communities, and I think it certainly hasn't been a pretty good 10 months for those communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously that topic has taken up more time than I thought it would, but there are other things I do wish to mention very briefly. This government said that its energy policy was the most modelled policy by an opposition in history. The Ukraine war had started, when they came into government, and they were saying they were going to lower everyone's electricity bills. Again, it hasn't been a good 10 months for anyone who has to pay an energy bill. The mortgages—they actually said mortgages would be lower under them when they came into government, and, again, it hasn't been a great 10 months for any mortgage repayment person in this country. So there's a lot that this government has to be ashamed of in its first 10 months.</span>

Still, when I'm in my community and talking to people, it is absolutely the case that people walk up to me and say, 'Look, I just want to say: you guys are doing a really good job,' or, 'I just want to say, it's so impressive having the adults in charge again. I just want to say how refreshing that feels.' So that's what is happening in our community at the moment, and it's happening because this government is getting on with the job of all the things that those opposite ignored, and not just ignored for 10 months; they ignored them for nearly 10 years!</span>

Deputy Speaker, I cannot tell you how many times people in my community came up to me in despair under the previous government, in absolute despair about where this country was heading, in absolute despair about the future of their children, of this country and of our entire world, because what they could see was that nothing was happening—absolutely nothing under those opposite. Those opposite don't even believe climate change is real. The member for New England has made that very, very clear. So, as a result of all of that, this government came in with a very big task, and we have been getting on with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 10 months, our government has delivered this country's first real climate change policy in a decade. That is a massive achievement. We know we haven't got it all done yet. We know how much there is still to do, but we are on the right track. We are on the track that gives this country a future, which helps build the jobs and the industries of the future, which helps make sure that we are a clean, green energy superpower.</span>

                  </a>  That's what I am here to do. You invited it this afternoon. I am absolutely here to tell you how good we. That is exactly the topic you gave us; thank you. One of the other areas that our government has brought a real focus to over the last 10 months is transparency, accountability and honesty. Again, if I look at things people in my community were saying to me before the last election that they were so concerned about, they were about how this place operates. They were about whether they could trust the people in this place and those in charge. And what have we done since we were elected? We've delivered the National Anti-Corruption Commission that those opposite could not deliver. They promised, but they did not deliver. We know that Australians want those in power in our country to be held to account. We know that they want those of us in here to behave to the highest possible standards, and that's what we have been getting on with.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making lives fairer and more equal for Australian women. We've put gender equality at the heart of our work, delivering cheaper child care, the biggest boost to paid parental leave since the scheme was introduced, a record investment to improve women's safety, gender responsive budgeting and great work in women's health—such important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to close on one of the most important things our government has been doing in the last 10 months, and that's the work we are doing to advance an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to this place. Just today we have seen the Prime Minister unveil what the question will look like. This is such a massive opportunity for our country. I want to commend all the people who have done the work to get us to this point. I want to encourage all Australians to take up the opportunity that is now before us, to turn a new page in our country's story, to walk forward together and to embrace what it means to have the oldest living continuing culture in our country. It is a huge, exciting opportunity. I'm so proud to be part of a government that is doing this together with our country for our country.</span>

In his heart of hearts, he knows that it hasn't. Certainly it hasn't. If he and those opposite believe otherwise, they belong in the next chapter of history's most famous people who are delusional. It certainly hasn't been a pretty good 10 months for farmers, who, thanks to the Minister for the Environment and Water, are now faced with buybacks in the river communities. They are not saying that it's been a pretty good 10 months.</span>

Indeed, we heard on 97 occasions that there was going to be a $275 cut to those bills. Where is that cut? Of course, it's delusional. It is delusional of those opposite, but they won't even mention the $275. Oh, no, you don't hear them mention that figure anymore, because it has been wiped from their talking points. It was in their talking points.</span>

I know the member for Page mentioned this, but the cashless debit card had led to better communities. It had led to better outcomes. Certainly, the Aboriginal people who live in those remote communities were getting better outcomes from the cashless debit card, and that has been taken away. That is indeed so sad.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't been a 'pretty good 10 months' for truckies. I acknowledge the frontline medical professionals—the nurses and the doctors—and everyone else who played a part in saving lives during COVID, but it was the truckies who transported the vaccines and the personal protection equipment around the country and who did so much to keep the toilet rolls supplied when everybody thought they needed 10 toilet rolls every time they went to the loo. They were the real unsung heroes of the global pandemic right here in Australia. I was the minister who put the national transport freight logistics code in place—in hours, not weeks, months or whatever the case might be—with the state ministers, albeit some were Labor, and I thank them again. That's what the truckies did, and what are they getting in return? A 10 per cent rise in a truckie tax that they don't want, they don't need, they don't deserve and they certainly didn't expect. 'It's been a pretty good 10 months,' the Prime Minister says—not at all! It hasn't been a good 10 months, not for families, not for business, not for farmers, not for truckies and not for remote Aboriginal communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is what Labor is going to do in the first 10 months of government, then goodness knows what's going to come in the future. But Australians are onto this government; they know that they have been duped. They won't be duped again. They won't be duped twice. They won't be misled twice when they hear Labor candidates saying, 'We're going to cut your power bills,' because we know that under Labor you always pay more.</span>

Five minutes is a long time sometimes in this place, and 10 months can go just like that. And 10 years? Ten years can do so much damage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had 10 years of a government that refused to acknowledge the need for action on climate change—so much damage. We've had 10 years of a government that refused to see education as an investment, seeing it only as a cost, and then chose to fund the private sector more than the public sector. We've had 10 years of a government that oversaw a rise in the cost of child care to 49 per cent, as we heard today from the education minister, a government which should be responsible for these things. We've had 10 years of a government under which the Australian public lost faith in the integrity of this place. We've had 10 years of a government that didn't come into this place every day with a razor-sharp focus on the Australian public and on building back confidence and belief in our domestic conventions and institutions. In 10 months, this government has been focused on all of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was 10 years of a government that cared so little about the cost of living for those who had ever accessed social security that it thought it was appropriate to introduce an unlawful system that targeted some of our most vulnerable. It wasn't just our most vulnerable that were targeted; it was young people. The government targeted people who had been students. People had accessed our safety net to support themselves while they were studying, only to find, as I did, sitting with many of them in my electorate, that when they got their first job they were hit with an unlawful and wrong robodebt. People were told, through the issuing of that debt and the skitching of debt collectors after them, that they had done something wrong. I said to young people in my electorate, 'You need to fight this, because in paying it back you're acknowledging that you defrauded the Commonwealth, when in fact you did not.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the government we had for 10 years, and in 10 months this government has worked solidly on the commitments that we took to the election to rebuild the faith of the Australian public in this institution, to rebuild the faith of the Australian public that a federal government can exist and can do things about the cost-of-living crisis as well as introduce the things we promised to do. That's what this government is about. We can say they've been a good 10 months because what we've done in those 10 months is deliver on our promises. Cheaper childcare was a commitment. It's also a cost-of-living relief. </span>

                  </a>  I hear the interjection about power prices from over there. You know what this government sees? This government sees every challenge in this country as an opportunity, and the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to become a clean, green energy superpower. That's how this government sees the world. Every challenge is an opportunity. When we were elected only to find the hidden promise was a great increase in power prices, did we shirk it? No, we confronted it. We say: 'There's a challenge. What will we do about that? Let me think—we'll bring parliament back and we'll do something to support those families. We'll bring in legislation to this place and not waste a minute, not say it's close to Christmas, we'll deal with that in January.' No, no, no. We brought parliament back to pass legislation, only to find that in these 10 months those opposite couldn't bring themselves to support the Australian public and to support this government. We've been a good government because we've got on with the job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance brought by my colleague the member for Hume today, and I thank him for bringing this matter to the House. The Prime Minister's claimed that Australians have had a pretty good 10 months, but I'm yet to have any Australian, besides maybe some of those that sit opposite us, saying to me that they have had a pretty good 10 months. Nobody in my electorate of Hughes has come to me to say, 'I've had a really good 10 months', or even a pretty good 10 months. Instead, I'm hearing that on average in my electorate they are now paying almost $2,000 a month more on mortgages—and 30 per cent of my electorate still have a mortgage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What impact does this have on small businesses in my electorate and small businesses throughout Australia? Small businesses in my electorate are saying many things. Cafe owners will say: 'People used to come in and buy two cups of coffee. Now they're cutting down to one.' A local beautician in Sutherland only two weeks ago said to me: 'Discretionary spend is down. People are no longer coming in and getting the same amount of services that they used to get.' Cafe owners again have said: 'We used to have the Tuesday lunch crowd that used to come in. Now they're coming in and having coffees instead.' That is having a direct impact on small businesses, which has a flow-on impact on employment and on my electorate of Hughes. I ask that the Prime Minister explain which Australians he was referring to when he said Australians have had a pretty good 10 months. He's refused to answer questions this week about it. I asked the Prime Minister a question about the closure of what used to be a local institution in the Sutherland shire. This was an Italian restaurant, Caruso's. They closed their doors at the beginning of March and said they were closing their doors because of the escalating costs of power and the other living costs that have increased so much over the last 10 months. They'd been in business for 17 years, and now they've closed their doors and people have lost their jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families, over the past 10 months, have had nine consecutive rate rises under this government. I don't know how it can be said that Australians have had a pretty good 10 months. It just does not make sense. Older Australians having to choose between heating and eating would not agree with the Prime Minister's assertion that Australians have had a pretty good 10 months. Parents that are having to make tough choices about their budgets wouldn't say it's been a pretty good 10 months. And we just keep saying it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will draw some direct quotes from the Prime Minister. Indeed, at the Labor launch on 1 May last year he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… as your Prime Minister—I won't run from responsibility. I won't treat every crisis as a chance to blame someone else. I will show up, I will step up, I will bring people together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a beautiful statement. Ten months down the track that has not occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 April last year on ABC<span style="font-style:italic;"> News </span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">reakfast,</span> he said, 'I will take responsibility. I'll show leadership. I'll deal with the challenges. And there are also opportunities that we can seize.' At a Sydney press conference on 10 April last year he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think that Australians want a government that does its job, that doesn't always blame someone else, that accepts responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do we hear now that the increase in power prices is because of the war in Ukraine, for example? This Prime Minister, this government, continue to blame somebody else, even a war overseas, for problems within Australia that they simply cannot fix, that they do not have answers for. Under this government and under Labor governments forever Australian families, Australian businesses, Australians always pay more under Labor.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  What a difference 10 months makes. Ten months ago people were talking to me about how anxious they were that Australia would never take action on climate change. Ten months ago people were talking to me about aged care and the conditions people were facing. Ten months ago people were talking to me about their concerns about being able to follow the career they wanted because of concerns about TAFE. Ten months ago the world was a different place, and it was not a better place, because of the policies that those opposite had pursued for a decade. It was a decade of not valuing education. It was a decade of not valuing early education and recognising that the support we give our young people as their brains are developing in the preschool years is crucial. Not only that, but not supporting families meant that women weren't able to get back into the workforce in the way that they wanted to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look back 10 months ago and think of the myriad of problems people were experiencing and raising with me—even I felt overwhelmed by the job that we would have if we won the election. And it turns out clearly we did win the election. I have been blown away by the determination of the ministers, the assistant ministers and the special envoys that we have. I have been blown away by the determination that has been shown to work methodically through, supported by, and I include myself in this, a terrific team of backbenchers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I literally just looked at an email that had come through from a constituent. He's a constituent who doesn't always agree with me about things, but the words he used were: 'You've had a terrific first 10 months.' In fact, he thought it was a year, so he thinks we've been here a year. The keywords were: 'and you seem determined to press on', and that is what we're doing on this side of the House. We don't look at a problem and go, 'Oh, let's pretend it's not there because it might go away.' We don't ignore things. We don't ignore the fact that climate change is wreaking havoc on our community. Members across there know the experience I have had in my electorate and the experience my constituents have gone through, not just in the last couple of years, but back, just when they were elected in 2013, when bushfires swept through Winmalee and Mount Victoria. We know that this government was aware there were some issues, but what did they do? Absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, every time we've seen a problem—some of them we knew about before the election. Others have emerged. Some were hidden from us, like the reality of what the power increases would be. That was hidden, not just from us but from the Australian people before the election. But we don't go, 'Oh, let's pretend—la, la, la—it's not really happening.' We tackle the issues, methodically working through them and collaboratively working through them. That's a word those opposite should look up in a dictionary and really embrace. We're collaborating across this parliament, wherever there is a willingness to do so. Every day you see evidence of that as we pass our legislation through this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to have time, in the minute and 10 seconds that remains, to talk through all the things we've passed, but let's just take a look at a few of them. We now have a national anticorruption commission, about to start its work. In 100 days, we will have cheaper child care. That is economic micro reform. For many families that's going to transform their ability to work. We have made medicines cheaper. They are cheaper now. It's cheaper when you go to get a script filled, whether you're a pensioner, whether you're on a seniors health card or whether you're not on any of those. What's more, there are more people who have access to that seniors health card. We did it. We have 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave. It's there and operating. There's an electric vehicle discount that's been legislated. It's now law.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made more changes in 10 months than those opposite could even imagine. What would have happened had they still been sitting on this bench? Absolutely nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  Today I'd like to speak about the Prime Minister's claim that Australians have had a pretty good 10 months. This claim is extraordinary. It's astonishing. It's remarkable. But the problem with it is that it's fictitious, because it just ain't true. I don't know anyone who's better off than they were 10 months ago. I don't know any Australian who is. It is absolutely unbelievable. There are rising insurance costs, rising fuel costs, rising power prices and rising mortgages, and the list just goes on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Lee, my constituent, whose home is in Mackay but who is currently in the Townsville hospital fighting an aggressive cancer? He has been there since January receiving chemo treatment, unable to work, with no income protection insurance and 400 kilometres away from his wife, children and support network. This family is suffering from financial stress and, on top of Lee's medical costs, they are facing the pressures of rising living costs. These should not be Lee's worries to have at the moment. His priority should be his health and winning his fight against cancer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came to this place to make a difference. I came to this place to serve the people of Dawson, who were already going pretty well under the coalition—as a matter of fact, very well. But what I'm asking for is: can those opposite actually honour some of their commitments, because my people of Dawson are hurting? Rising mortgage costs and rising power costs are hurting my people. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about that from this stage, because I'm on the opposition. But I'm pleading with you folks, from the goodness of your hearts, to please help my people out and address the rising cost of living.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Ben, for example. Ben's a constituent of mine, and his business is refrigerated transport and refrigerated cold stores. His model is that he picks up fruit and vegetables from growers, takes them back to his place, cools them in the cold stores and then forwards them on using bigger trucks. He's rung me and said: 'Andrew, I cannot afford the rates that these electricity prices are going up by. I cannot make that work and, more importantly, I can't pass those costs on because my people simply cannot afford it.' He goes: 'What do I do? Also, can you tell me what happened to the $275 reduction in power prices that Labor promised before the election?' He is actually blown away by this, and so am I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what is Labor's answer to this? It's to put price caps on electricity and gas prices. Now, hasn't that worked a treat! I'm proud that I voted against that, because ever since that happened prices have only been going up. It's simple economics. Look at what's happening with gas. When you look at the supply and demand situation, what you need to do to reduce the price is put more gas into the system. But, no. And I'll tell you what for those opposite: you've already had your sugar hit. If it hasn't worked so far, you wait to see what's going to happen in the future. No-one's investing in gas anymore because you have taken their certainty away. It's just simple economics. You need to get on board with this.</span>

But in 10 short months, the trails of broken promises are everywhere to be seen. The $275 power relief—broken promise. No changes in superannuation—broken promise. A 24/7 registered nurse in all aged-care facilities—broken promise. No changes to the franking credits—broken promise. 'Your mining jobs will be safe'—you used to back the miners, or you used to back in the day, but now not at all. You back your old mates the Greens. What a turnout! You've turned your back on the people who have always supported you. What a turnout. Absolutely unbelievable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">PAYNE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I want to thank those opposite for bringing on this matter of public importance today that gives us an opportunity to talk about the first 10 months of the Albanese Labor government. I wish I had more than five minutes to talk about the changes that we have delivered, the changes for Australians that, in 10 months, are making such a difference. It's an interesting strategy from those opposite. I don't quite understand it, but I'm happy to speak on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk to people in my community of Canberra, there is a palpable sigh of relief. A number of people have approached me and said, 'We are just so happy with the change of government.' There is a change of mood in this place. We'd come in here crying out for action on a whole range of issues—on climate change, on age care, on cost of living—all of these things that are so important to my constituents and all Australians—that the previous government took absolutely no responsibility for. As the member for Lalor was just saying, when we see a challenge now, we confront it. That is what government is about. We approach things by taking responsibility and getting on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about a few of the key achievements in our first 10 months in government. As I said, I've only got five minutes, so I won't get to talk about them. In our first 10 months of government, we have established the National Anti-Corruption Commission—another thing that those opposite failed to deliver, even though they promised to do it. They never even introduce the legislation. We have passed a climate change bill and updated our climate targets, and at the moment we are trying to get through this House, in a very consultative manner, the very important safeguard mechanism that will begin transitioning our economy to a low-emissions economy and getting us to our target of net zero by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making child care cheaper and in 100 days time over a million Australian families will be better off with this policy—including so many in Canberra who struggle with some of the highest childcare costs in the country. We have made medicines cheaper. We have introduced legislation to expand paid parental leave. We have secured an increase in the minimum wage and a pay rise for aged-care workers—a much deserved and overdue pay rise. We have passed legislation to get wages moving. We have advanced a Voice to parliament, and I'm incredibly proud to be part of a government taking this on and getting it done. Today, giving the wording of the question that we will take to a referendum is an incredibly important moment for Australia. It's an opportunity to walk forward in reconciliation. The previous government initially sounded like, maybe, they were going to do it—and just shirked it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We established a royal commission into robodebt. We are repairing our international relations. We have created 180,000 new fee-free TAFE places and are delivering 20,000 new university places. We have established 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, one of our first actions in government, because no-one should face the choice of their job or their safety. We convened a Jobs and Skills Summit. We established Jobs and Skills Australia. We ended the cashless debit card, expanded the Commonwealth seniors health card and delivered the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made it easier for pensioners to earn more without losing their pension and have acted to take the sting out of energy prices and ensure bill relief. We've green-lighted over $16 billion in renewable energy infrastructure in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania through Rewiring the Nation. We've introduced the first cultural policy in a decade, which we didn't even have under the previous government because they simply didn't care about the arts and culture in this country. I am very proud of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we announced Australia's first endometriosis and pelvic pain GP clinics across the country, including one right here in the ACT. I was very proud to join the minister for that announcement. And, very importantly, for the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory, we allowed the debate on restoring territory rights, something the previous government would not do. It  enabled the member for Solomon and me to bring a private member's bill and ensure that our constituents have the same democratic rights now as those in the rest of the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am very, very proud of our first 10 months of a government that is making the changes that matter for Australians—as Labor governments always do. </span>

I wanted to highlight how important honesty, integrity and accountability are to the proper functioning of our democratic government. They are important everywhere and to almost all Australians, but we feel this particularly keenly in my electorate of Calwell. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Calwell is one of the many outer suburban electorates around Australia with a very high proportion of citizens and residents who were born overseas. Many of those who have migrated to our great country have come as refugees or as people wanting to escape war, corruption, persecution or just general chaos in the countries they've left behind. They come to Australia with high hopes of stability, a healthy democracy and a system that makes sense and works as it was intended—where there are no secrets, no handshakes behind closed doors, no rules that apply to some but not all. A government that uses its power and position to mislead, to subvert longstanding conventions and to avoid proper scrutiny is not what we hold up as an Australian standard to any of our citizens, longstanding or recent.</span>

There are so many people becoming new citizens. It's fortunate that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs is in the chamber today, because I get the opportunity to read out his message. I was going to quote from the message, but I think I'm just going to read it into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> because it speaks a lot about the values that we—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is one important step in restoring the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government, and it will help to ensure greater transparency and accountability and will implement the first of the six recommendations from the Bell inquiry. It is a step in the rebuilding of integrity in public sector institutions and programs, and I look forward to a strengthened relationship of trust between government and nation through the proper functioning of parliament and executive across all areas of public policy and service delivery. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  It's a pleasure to join this very important debate on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 and a particular pleasure to follow my friend the member for Calwell. I might return to her remarks shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to start by recognising that during the course of the pandemic something quite remarkable happened—something remarkable and important but also precious—and that is that we saw an increase in trust in our politics and in our democratic institutions as people appreciated how vital it was to have a functioning democracy, a functioning parliament and, of course, a functioning government. This turned around a trend that had beset Australia and, indeed, most advanced democracies for quite some time. To see people feel the absolutely fundamental importance of government as a force for good in our lives and a necessary force in hard times is something that I hope every member in this place and the other place takes very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this trend, unfortunately, proved to be somewhat illusory. It was a light at the end of the tunnel but turned out to be a train in the form of the Morrison government—in particular some of the decision-making of the former Prime Minister the member for Cook. The actions that give rise to the necessity of adopting this bill into law really go to the heart of our democratic system, our system of responsible government, as the Solicitor-General has highlighted and as other members, in making their contribution to this debate, have touched upon. What happened in secret ripped apart the very core of our democratic traditions in Australia and denied that sense of trust and confidence in government that should be so important to everyone in this place. The 151 members of the House of Representatives bring to this place their values, their sense of how the world is and how the world should be. I'm sure all of us bring to it a sincere appreciation of our duty not just to represent our constituents but also to make the case for our view of the world, to be part of a democratic conversation. That is something that we clearly can't take for granted, because it has been undermined absolutely fundamentally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this bill is so important, and I'm pleased to join so many of my colleagues not only in committing to vote for the Ministers of State Amendment Bill but in placing on the record my very serious view about the need for this bill. Perhaps we shouldn't see the need for such a bill. Perhaps it's understandable that, over the course of the 120-odd years of our Commonwealth parliamentary democracy, no-one previously thought that it could be required, because it is absolutely extraordinary that a prime minister would commission, or cause to be commissioned, ministers into office without informing the public, without informing his colleagues around the cabinet table and without informing the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very honoured—it is the greatest honour of my working life—to be appointed as a minister in the Albanese government. It's a responsibility I take seriously, and I know all of my colleagues in the executive—I see the member for Fenner here too—take this responsibility, this privilege, this duty, very seriously. I think about that not only broadly, as having the opportunity to make decisions as part of executive government, but particularly in the context of the responsibilities that I have as a minister in the home affairs department, as the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. I'm very conscious that I'm granted, through the Migration Act, a number of discretionary powers—discretionary powers that only a minister in the home affairs department can rely upon. These powers are pretty significant in the lives of individuals but also insofar as our national interest is upheld and preserved. It is absolutely extraordinary that there could be uncertainty as to which members of a government could be entrusted such sweeping discretionary powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly extraordinary that the minister who quite rightly regarded herself as being sworn in to oversight this had absolutely no idea that others had recourse to these powers. The line of thinking about what could have happened and how the rights of individuals and our national interest could have been undermined through this uncertainty is quite terrifying. This is one example, out of many, of the democratic and real-life consequences of the practices undertaken by the member for Cook which would be redressed quickly through the enactment of this bill—a bill that should surely be supported by every member and senator in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst my responsibilities, as my friend the member for Calwell noted, I am privileged to be the minister for citizenship, and part of that privilege is providing the minister's message, a message on behalf of the Australian government, to our newest Australians. I thank the member for Calwell for the courtesy and kindness she's just extended to me. Part of that message, of course, talks about the common bonds that we share as Australians. Fundamental to that is an appreciation of our commitment to democracy and the rule of law. How ironic that the leader of Australia's government could so profoundly undermine both of those fundamental Australian values!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes deeper than that, actually, because those people who become Australian citizens sit a citizenship test. A big part of that citizenship test, as all members would be well aware, involves members—prospective citizens, rather, but they may be prospective members of this place too!—being tested on their understanding of the rule of law, democracy and our system of government and the law. How ironic that a former prime minister who was also a former minister responsible for immigration and citizenship—although he didn't talk too much about those responsibilities; everything seemed to be an on-water matter in those days—could so profoundly undermine that. How shocking—and in a majority migrant nation, too. I believe having this process of building on our shared understanding of what it means to be Australian is an important part of building a stronger nation. The very least the government can do is seek to support those shared aspirations and seek to build a stronger understanding about how our democratic systems work, and, indeed, how they might work better—not undermine them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the attitude of the former government, in particular the member for Cook, and the government led by Anthony Albanese could not be greater. This government has a big agenda, and the last 10 months have demonstrated that. The member for Canberra set out in a short contribution a very effective highlights reel of some of the substantive achievements—the things that are changing the lives of individual Australians for the better and changing our country for the better, too. I think about those things; I think about each and every one of them. But the bigger thing is rebuilding the sense that politics matters, eroding the corrosive cynicism that pervades so many in our communities who don't believe that our democracy is working as it should. It's a cynicism, unfortunately, that is shared not only by those who are clearly at the very top of the former government but by members who still sit opposite, who clearly do not have the courage of their convictions and who do not believe that we can have a democratic system anchored in strong institutions, institutions that are about transparency and integrity, so that the accountability that is fundamental to our system of government can be maintained, so that every member of our community can have trust and confidence in our system of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing so much as a government to rebuild trust and confidence in Australian democracy. But that begins with the passage of this bill, making it very clear who is entrusted on behalf of the Australian people to undertake executive office so that they can be held to account—including, of course, in this place, every sitting day, in question time. It shouldn't be a difficult proposition for this to be clearly set out to every member of the Australian community—indeed, to every member of this place: to whom they should be addressing their questions and their concerns, and of whom they can demand answers. That should be a pretty fundamental principle. I am disappointed that we've seen very few contributions from members opposite—again, with a couple of exceptions that recognise the importance of this.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beginning to restore trust and confidence rests in the passage of this bill, but that isn't the whole of the task that's before us. I'm so pleased that, after prevarication and, again, more of the cynicism that so characterised the administration of the member for Cook, we now have a national anticorruption commission. We now have, in this jurisdiction, to go with the other eight jurisdictions in Australia, a mechanism where people who make decisions over the lives of others can be properly held to account. People can be properly held to account for their bureaucratic decision-making, and people such as me and Minister McBain here can be held to account in this place, as we should be, with people knowing exactly what it is we are charged to be responsible for. It shouldn't be hard for that to be accepted as a basic standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about building trust and confidence in politics, there is a big step forward that we are about to embark upon as a nation—that is, to recognise in our Constitution our First Peoples. I think we can all be proud of the work that's been led by Minister Burney, championed by the Prime Minister, and so many others in putting forward to the Australian people a proposition that answers the very generous gesture put together in the Uluru Statement from the Heart so that we can complete our national birth certificate and ensure that debate in this place and in government is informed by the perspective of First Nations people—another very big step towards this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I have a vision—a vision that would take trucks off Brisbane roads, making it safer for Brisbane families by reducing congestion, noise and air pollution; a vision that would bring thousands of job opportunities for locals; a vision that would strengthen our supply chain resilience and increase the export and import capabilities of local businesses; a vision that would revolutionise the Queensland economy and ensure that Queensland is brought into line with the world's best practice for freight. That vision is 'tunnel vision'. A dedicated tunnel connecting the Port of Brisbane to the Inland Rail would transform Brisbane into the logistics capital of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2022 financial year the Port of Brisbane, located in the north of my electorate of Bonner, contributed $7.8 billion to the Queensland economy. Along with its supply chain networks, the Port of Brisbane also supported 63,000 jobs, with 7,900 of those jobs directly within the port district. This is despite the Port of Brisbane currently running at 10 per cent capacity. Let me reiterate that: it is running at only 10 per cent capacity. Think of the billions of dollars, thousands of jobs and limitless business opportunities we are currently missing out on because the Port of Brisbane is running at only 10 per cent capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing a disservice to current and future generations of Australians if we do not unlock the Port of Brisbane's economic potential. My 'tunnel vision' will help achieve this, by bringing our freight network into the 21st century. It has the added benefit of taking a predicted 13 million trucks off Brisbane roads by 2050. Currently 97 per cent of container freight that leaves the Port of Brisbane is by truck, causing increased road degradation, traffic congestion and noise and air pollution for Brisbane locals. Don't get me wrong; truckies are vital to our economy, and, without them, Australia would stop. We must always be thankful for our truckies. But the reality is: with the prediction of over 50 per cent of Queensland's population living in Brisbane by 2032, the city is becoming increasingly landlocked, and it will not be viable to have this many trucks on Brisbane roads. All it will do is cause more congestion, increase freight costs with time lost and put greater pressure on businesses and supply chains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Tunnel vision' is the best solution to get trucks off roads, whilst also causing the least disruption to family homes and our local environment. With fully electric locomotives, we will also ensure our future supply chains reduce their carbon footprint and eliminate the need for smokestacks in the tunnels. There is just one major problem, though: we are still waiting for the Queensland state government to release the Port of Brisbane Strategic Rail Access Study. On 17 February 2021 I wrote to the Queensland state Minister for Transport and Main Roads, urging him to release the study—a study that the former coalition government contributed $20 million to. It's over two years later, and this taxpayer funded report still has not been made public. This means that I, along with other MPs and councillors, cannot consult with our constituents and engage in community feedback. It means we cannot tell them exactly where the train lines will be and we cannot tell them how or if their homes will be impacted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply put, we are all in the dark. This is unfair and un-Australian. While there is no doubt that the cost of the tunnel will be in the billions, the 'tunnel vision' project is about leaving a legacy for future generations. This is about saying that we planned for their future; that, when we had the chance we took the trucks off the road and made the roads safer for families; that we protected our local environment; and that we planned for the future growth of Brisbane. We cannot wait; the time is now. I am calling on the state Labor government to release the Port of Brisbane Strategic Rail Access Study and help plan for a better future for all of Brisbane and, indeed, all of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  On Monday night, here in Parliament House, we took Wollongong to the world, as the University of Wollongong and I hosted the inaugural Illawarra Clean Energy Expo. Although this building is the home of Australian democracy, on Monday you could feel the power of the Illawarra in the room. The atmosphere was absolutely electric. Special thanks must go to the university for working with me to make this concept a reality. A very, very special thank you to the key organisers: Vice-Chancellor Professor Patricia Davidson; Director of the Energy Futures Network, Ty Christopher; Director of Government Relations, Canio Fierravanti, who is well known in the corridors of Parliament House; and Heidi De Coster and her husband, Greg, from Protocol at the University of Wollongong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank and acknowledge the powerhouse of organisations that were present on Monday night. From BlueScope Steel, we had Iain McDonald, Manager, Carbon Abatement, Future Technologies and Sarah Ward, Manager, Climate Change Communications. From BOC gases, we had Chris Dolman, Daniel Mills and Vesna Olles. From Business Illawarra, we had Adam Zarth, who I work with quite often as well. From Ecojoule, we had Tony Ferguson and Mike Wishart. From Green Gravity, we had Tania Jones, Tim Robertson and Mark Swinnerton. From Gridsight, we had Brendan Banfield, Robyn Dawson and Brad Smith. From Hysata, we had Paul Barrett, Parchi Agrawal and Duncan Bremner. From I3net, we had Michelle Christodoulou. From Blend Esq, we had Robyn Johnson. From NSW Ports, we had Marika Calfas, the CEO, Paul Barrett, Campbell Mason and Greg Walls. From Oceanex, we had Tim Black, Tim Donnan, Jordan Glanville, Sarah Guilfoyle, Thomas Hansen and Karly Spronk. From Project and Portfolio Management, we had Rodger Bowman, Troy McDonald and Dorian Van Zyl. From Rewiring Australia, we had Kate Minter and Francis Veierboom. From South Coast Labour Council, we had Arthur Rorris. From Sicona, we had Christiaan Jordaan and Andrew Minett. From Squadron Energy, we had Jason Wiloughby, Ben Deer, Emma Leslie and Rochelle Macdonald. From Wise Energy, we had Michelle Hoess, Damian Vaquera, Brittney Woodgate and Alex Yates. And from Wollongong City Council, we had Mitch Golding and Mark Grimson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we had the fantastic exhibitors from the University of Wollongong which, as Minister Chris Bowen, said is an institution. It has used its nation-leading research facilities to put the Illawarra on the cutting edge of innovation that is being conducted through the Sustainable Buildings Research Centre, the School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ARC future grids training centre, the Australian Centre for Culture, Environment, Society and Space, the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security, the Australian Power Quality and Reliability Centre, the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials and the Innovation and Commercial Research Unit. These facilities do some amazing work for our local area. Special mention should also go to Craig McLauchlan, Raad Raad, Kashem Muttaqi, Marjo Niemela, Chantel Carr, Natasha Larkin, Freya Croft, Camille Goodman, Zahra Shahbazian, Jason David, Sean Elphick and Jon Knott. The Illawarra's world-class innovation and expertise were demonstrated by a large attendance by Canberra's diplomatic community, all of whom were keen to learn, partner and collaborate on our expertise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Illawarra are already changing our practices and reducing our emissions, introducing new technologies and activities to move quickly, efficiently and safely towards a clean energy future. The Australian government is investing in a range of projects with local partners, all meant to boost the Illawarra's preparedness for the changing energy future. Some of these include investing more than $1 million in a University of Wollongong study finding ways to keep Australia's grid secure; the Energy Future Skills Centre; the Renewable Energy Skills Training Centre at TAFE; $9 million for Hysata; 400 community batteries across the country, including one in Warrawong; and we're one of the first six proposed sides for offshore wind energy. We've also got more than 900 additional places at the University of Wollongong—an amazing contribution by the Albanese Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Sadly, it's getting harder by the day for hardworking Australian families to make ends meet under Labor. Under the Albanese government's watch, mortgage holders have suffered through nine consecutive interest rate increases. This is putting enormous pressure on everyday Australian families. When I get out and about, listening to communities right across this great country, the first thing that most people and businesses raise with me is how much harder life has become in the last 10 months. Life is particularly tough for the 800,000 families who currently have fixed mortgages who are about to go onto floating rates; we know they're going to see very sharp increases in their mortgage payments. In my home state of New South Wales 58 per cent of mortgage holders with a fixed rate will be rolling off those fixed rates this year—so a family with a typical mortgage of $750,000 will be slapped with $1,700 a month in increased mortgage payments overnight, as they go from fixed to floating rates. This could be enough to tip some over the edge. Let's not forget the soaring grocery bills and skyrocketing power bills. If you combine these together, the average New South Wales family with a mortgage could be slugged more than $23,000 a year in additional costs. It's just hard to fathom how they are going to find the money to pay those extra costs. That's almost $2,000 every month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the ugly reality of inflation under this government. Every day I hear stories of great sacrifices hardworking Australian families are having to make to pay bills and put food on the table for their children. Jason, from Robina, in the member for McPherson's electorate, has been forced to take on a second job because the time for cheap money is over. The father of two is also considering cuts to the family budget, including cancelling things like kids swimming lessons, TV subscriptions and going out on weekends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Hume, small-business owner Kym, who runs at the famous Barenz restaurant in Camden, says he can already see the difference in customer behaviour caused by rising interest rates and soaring power bills:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Patronage is definitely lower. You can see the pressures of cost of living and concerns about interest rate rises holding back every day spending.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that won't be the end of it, but that's what goes first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member for Petrie's electorate, small-business owner Liz, from Flowerfusion, who I had the chance to meet recently in the Moreton Bay region, says cost of living is hitting her customers hard. She said she's starting to notice a huge drop in sales, particularly in the weeks the Reserve Bank has hiked interest rates. This is the reality. This is what is happening on the ground. Indeed, if you walk into any small business across Australia chances are that they will have stories just like this. Australian families are struggling, yet our Prime Minister wants to hide under the covers and pretend it's not happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more people than ever seeking help from charity groups like Foodbank and the Cowra Information and Neighbourhood Centre in the member for Riverina's electorate, where I was recently. They're struggling to put food on the table. Many have no choice but to take on a second job, as I gave an example of earlier, so that they can pay the bills. Lifeline has, worryingly, seen an increase of 50 per cent in requests for help and support in relation to financial issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact that this is having on people's lives and their mental health is frightening. When things get tough, Australians have no choice but to tighten their belts and manage their budgets. And that's exactly what the government should be doing to help them out, by taking pressure off interest rates and making sure it's not all just the Reserve Bank doing the work. There is currently more than $45 billion of extra spending from this government. That will only put extra upward pressure on interest rates for Australians. This is money going on the taxpayers' credit card. Australians will be paying the principal and the interest on it. We need this Prime Minister and this Treasurer focused on the issues that Australians care about, not their own favourite issues, not other issues, but on the cost of living and the real crisis we are seeing across our cities, our suburbs and our regions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Many people in my electorate are rightly concerned about access to health care, particularly to see their GP. I want to thank everyone in my electorate who has contacted me about this, for sharing their concerns and experiences about accessing their GP and bulk billing services. I also want to thank those GPs who have explained to me how they feel burnt out and anxious over whether they can handle the enormous pressures of working in health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that access to health care can have real impacts on people's health and life. A deferred trip to the GP because of cost or unavailability can mean serious consequences down the track. And, of course, it's not just individuals who suffer because of this. Health problems left unaddressed mean people struggle with coping with their lives. They are less able to work, to study, to care for children, to be productive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't get here by chance. This has happened due to nine long years of Liberal government cuts and neglect regarding Medicare. It's never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor than it is now. The former government froze Medicare rebates for six years, ripping billions of dollars out of primary care and causing gap fees to skyrocket. It's not surprising that doctors are now leaving general practice in their droves. But, now that the grown-ups are back in charge, we are cleaning up the mess left by the Liberal coalition. Afterall, Labor is the party of Medicare. We created Medicare, and we will protect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're giving our doctors the resources to invest in their GP practices through a $220 million Strengthening Medicare—General Practice Grants Program. We are also investing $146 million to attract and retain more health workers in rural and regional Australian areas, like my electorate of Corangamite, with improved training and incentive programs. And we're reducing costs for people who are looking to study nursing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our first budget, we cut the price of scripts for general patients by $12.50 a script. In September we cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicines, putting $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. In November we extended the Seniors Health Card to thousands and thousands more self-funded retirees so they'd get access to cheaper medicines as well. And, on 1 January, with our cheaper medicines policy, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Already, in just the first 2½ months of the scheme, we've put $36 million back into the pockets of Australian patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, we've announced one of 20 endometriosis clinics and pelvic pain centres to be located at Kardinia Health in Belmont. Too many people suffer from excruciating pain and delayed diagnosis. These women go through so much, and it's about time that we shed light on this hidden and often debilitating condition. This clinic will give them the best treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another reform, we will open one of 50 urgent-care clinics in Geelong. This will address people's non-life-threatening injuries and conditions. Instead of going to emergency, they can go to this clinic. It's going to mean less stress for health workers, it's going to mean people get treated quicker and it will mean that we can focus in our emergency departments on saving lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These investments are important. Our government knows this. We want to strengthen Medicare and we want to give people the health services they deserve. After nine long years of Liberal neglect, it is time. It is time for these investments. Labor will continue to support people in their health needs. We are certainly committed to ensuring that the health and wellbeing of our citizens are paramount. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise today as constituents in Hughes prepare to go to the polls this weekend to decide the future of the state of New South Wales, my home state. The Perrottet government has set the benchmark across the Commonwealth on how to govern and on how deliver state government services. The Perrottet government has delivered on infrastructure. It's delivered on roads, on public transport, on women's safety, on education, on health services, on tax reform and on some very important social issues. The past four years have not been easy. New South Wales has faced catastrophic drought, bushfires, a pandemic and one-in-100-year floods, yet, despite all these odds, the Perrottet government has kept New South Wales moving forward and has maintained its AAA credit rating. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within my federal seat I have four outstanding state members. They have been part of the Perrottet government team that has obtained extraordinary amounts of money that was invested in health and transport infrastructure, for example. This includes $151 million for Sutherland Hospital, which has been used for new operating theatres, an emergency departments and a new MRI machine. Our member for Cronulla, Mark Speakman, has been an outstanding Attorney General for our state as well as a staunch advocate for Cronulla. He keeps thinking outside the square. Our member for Miranda, Eleni Petinos, has helped to obtain over half a million dollars for Harrie Dening field, home to the Sutherland Shire Football Association, the largest sporting association in the Southern Hemisphere. The member for Holsworthy, Melanie Gibbons, advocated for and obtained $790 million for upgrades to Liverpool Hospital. The member for Heathcote, Lee Evans, worked with Ms Gibbons and our roads minister, Natalie Ward, to deliver $188 million to upgrade Heathcote Road and then secured funding of $35 million to upgrade the dangerous Heathcote Road bridge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestic and family violence are ever-present issues throughout our country, and my electorate of Hughes is no exception. Late last year the Perrottet government passed one of its most critical reforms to date, the criminalisation of coercive control. Coercive control is a form of domestic abuse that involves patterns of serious cumulative behaviour that deny victims-survivors of their autonomy and independence. New South Wales is the first state in the Commonwealth and one of the very few jurisdictions in the world to implement these reforms. I must commend the work of New South Wales Attorney General Mark Speakman and, again Natalie Ward, who also holds the portfolio of the Minister for Women's Safety. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Perrottet government has also led the way on cashless gaming reform to try to improve the lives of those who are suffering with problem gambling. Education reforms have also been a hallmark of the Perrottet government. We've seen a return to a curriculum based on numeracy, literacy and writing skills, stripping out some of the nonsense that had driven parents mad with the school system. More teachers in New South Wales are now permanent. Just this year alone, there are 15,000 more permanent teachers than there were at the start of the year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address the cost-of-living crisis, exacerbated largely by the nine consecutive rate rises we have seen under this federal Labor government, the Perrottet government has delivered a series of vouchers aimed to address this. These include $150 for the Premier's Back to School NSW Voucher, $500 for before and after school care, $285 for a low-income household energy rebate, $110 for a gas rebate and $180 for a family energy rebate. Seniors have not been forgotten, with a $200 seniors energy rebate. There's been preschool fee relief provided across our state, and, led by Natalie Ward, the cost of IVF has now been reduced. The New South Wales government has provided a $2,000 voucher to families looking to have a baby using IVF and has increased the number of fertility treatments in place in our public clinics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the recent launch where Dominic Perrottet announced the New South Wales Kids Future Fund, helping a new generation to build the foundations of financial security so that they are ready for success in the New South Wales of tomorrow. I commend the Perrottet government for its work with its fresh ideas, its fresh policy and its ability to take New South Wales forward. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Newcastle and the Hunter region have powered Australia for generations and will continue to do so well into the future. As a proud Novocastrian I understand this. So does the Albanese Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that carbon-intensive regions like Newcastle and the Hunter are ideally placed to take full advantage of the opportunities that come with renewable energy. That's why I am so excited that consultations for an offshore wind zone off the Newcastle coast are currently open. Community consultation sessions have already begun, with at least two face-to-face sessions in my electorate of Newcastle and an additional five that were held further north and south along the coastline. I'd like to thank those Novocastrians who took up this chance to hear directly from experts and to have their voices heard. I know there has been some concern about the potential impact of offshore wind on marine and bird life, and I want to reassure my constituents that around the world offshore wind farms do co-exist with wildlife—with whales, with migrant sea life and with birds. The proposed offshore wind zone, which is currently on display for public comment, follows initial analysis of marine topology, vessel traffic and sensitive environmental or defence areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the consultation process is to ensure that any infrastructure built within that proposed zone will have minimal impacts on marine users, the environment and wildlife. Following feedback from the community, the proposed area may need to be adjusted before a final offshore wind area is in fact declared, and there are a number of further steps to go through before any infrastructure can be built. Any company looking to establish an offshore renewable energy project is required to demonstrate how they will comply with the conditions of approval and environmental obligations under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This act provides a legal framework to protect and manage unique plants, animals, habitats and spaces, including marine areas. Potential developers will also need to submit a management plan to the Offshore Infrastructure Regulator. This process ensures that any developments manage risks in an environmentally acceptable way that also mitigates and minimises impacts on the environment and wildlife. I reassure the community that this is a genuine consultation process. I encourage all residents and all interested people to look at the map and to consider what it looks like, consider the implications for you and our community and then make a submission. They are open until 28 April.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to join Bekaert Australia recently to celebrate 100 years of continuous manufacturing excellence at their wire rope manufacturing facility in Mayfield. Originally known as Australia Wire Ropes Works, Bekaert was established in 1923 in Newcastle by what was BHP and four leading rope manufacturers in Great Britain. Bekaert holds a prominent place in Newcastle's—and, I suggest, the nation's—manufacturing history, employing and training thousands of men and women from the Newcastle and Hunter region over its long and distinguished career. It provided jobs during the Great Depression and diverted operations to support Australia's war efforts during World War II. Today Bekaert in Australia is a world leader in the manufacture, supply and technical support of wire and synthetic ropes. I was particularly pleased to see how much time and energy is going into being able to repurpose and renew those wire ropes, ensuring that the life cycle is extended fourfold compared to what it had been previously.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bekaert is just one of a number of leading manufacturing facilities now in Newcastle to have been operating for more than a century, which speaks volumes about the deep history of making things in our city—a tradition that stands to benefit enormously from Labor's $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. The National Reconstruction Fund investments will help regional areas like Newcastle to diversify our economy and help create secure, well paid jobs. There is a very bright future for manufacturing in Newcastle under a Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Here in Australia we're one of the most urbanised populations in the world. Globally, 50 per cent of the world population lives in cities, while in Australia it's 85 per cent. Cities are the site and often the root cause of problems, but they can also offer the solutions to our crises—and right now we have a cocktail of major crises: housing, climate and the cost-of-living crisis. But with good planning and design we can address these crises and create sustainable cities to house and nurture all of us and the environment, and not massive developer profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rising to this challenge offers so much opportunity to design our cities around balancing equity, environment and energy. Equity means everyone gets a well-designed, affordable home to live in, world-class public services, beautiful green space and active public transport that's free and more convenient than driving. Environmental health means balance between the natural and built environments by retaining and regenerating natural ecosystems, which will be part of addressing the energy and emissions crisis. This in turn will help deal with the climate crisis. Cities produce 70 per cent of global emissions, an enormous proportion of which is from motorised private transport. So we need to rapidly decarbonise the city, not through fake offsets like in the Brisbane City Council but by transitioning to entirely renewable sources of energy. What does this mean for Brisbane? Brisbane could be the demonstration sustainable city. Brisbane will be hosting the Olympics in 2032, and this could leave a positive legacy. Sadly, at the moment, the government looks set to hand it all over to big developers for massive profits and leave the community worse off when the athletes and tourists head home. But the next 10 years could be, must be, the time when we create and demonstrate the model of an Australian sustainable city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Ryan, I'm proud to be fighting for the start of this vision—for free, frequent and connected public transport for everyone; for walkable, safe neighbourhoods like the school community in The Gap; for preserving beautiful green space while delivering affordable housing at Kooya Road in Mitchelton; for a local school and services and a public and active transport bridge in Moggill-Bellbowrie; for a new community centre in Kenmore so real community can flourish; and for active transport infrastructure in St Lucia and across the west side. This new vision of the city isn't crazy; it's sensible, it's achievable, and it's urgently necessary. But we've got both major parties and their mates in the development industry in our way. So, to win it, it'll take all of us getting active and fighting for it.</span>

Last week I was delighted to meet with staff and students at South Metropolitan TAFE's AeroSpace Training Centre in Jandakot in my electorate. The scope of education there includes training to be cabin crew, aviation mechanics and pilots. Students can take advantage of a range of certificate courses that create pathways into the aviation industry as it recovers after the pandemic. The centre includes a 1,500-square-metre hangar which offers impressive and extensive hands-on practical training. The campus hosts helicopters, light aircraft and a broad range of aviation components, in addition to a flight simulator. I was chuffed to meet with the next generation of cabin crew on board the centre's own Boeing 737.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside aviation, Fremantle has long been a home to high school maritime training. In the north-west of my electorate, South Metropolitan TAFE's Fremantle campus has been delivering internationally recognised maritime skills training for more than 20 years. Now, thanks to a $2 million investment from the McGowan Labor government, the campus boasts a state-of-the-art maritime simulator suite. The simulators allow shipmasters, officers and engineers to use the latest technology and training tools to suit the needs of existing and emerging maritime industries. The project, notably, is one of the many under the McGowan government's investment in TAFE, the largest in Western Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former government there was a senseless and harmful decline in the number of apprentices and trainees across the country. Once again it is Labor governments, state and federal, that are doing the repair job in Western Australia, cleaning up the mess and helping prepare Australians for the future. There's no doubt that the aviation and maritime training capacity in my electorate has been expanded thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to deliver 180,000 fee-free TAFE places across the nation. Those opposite failed to secure a shared approach and commitment between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to drive skills and training forward, but, thankfully, under the leadership of my friend and colleague Brendan O'Connor, the Minister for Skills and Training, that has now changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of the year the Australian and WA governments signed a landmark skills agreement that means $112 million for WA skills and training and provides fee-free TAFE and vocational education for more than 18,000 students. There's already been a surge of uptake, with more than 13,000 enrolments in semester 1. Impressively, 66 per cent of the cohort enjoying the benefits of the fee-free training are women. Qualifications in early childhood education, aged and disability care, nursing and technology have seen the strongest enrolments. At a time when we find ourselves with workforce shortages and demand in critical sectors, it is again Labor governments, state and federal, that are investing in a stronger, more highly skilled workforce and building a more resilient, prosperous economy for all.</span>

Andrew was appointed to Manjimup's top administrative position in 2014. This was a just few months after I was first elected to federal parliament. Over the ensuing decade, Andrew and I have worked together on many game-changing projects, including the Power Up Electricity Museum, which received $2.6 million under the former coalition government's Building Better Regions Fund. The museum and associated cafe now form a wonderful modern entry point to Manjimup's Heritage Park. Another significant project is the Manjimup Wellness and Respite Community Centre, which received a $1.6 million grant under the National Stronger Regions Fund. These are two of many projects that have driven Manjimup's recent urban renaissance. Visitors to central Manjimup will notice the Brockman Street lights, the new cafes and night spots, the town's revamped art deco buildings and the free wi-fi available through the town centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these improvements have occurred on Mr Campbell's watch, but Manjimup as a shire is so much more. It's a shire of horticulture, truffles, premium wine production, tall timbers and quaint smaller towns. While Mr Campbell has been CEO I've been proud to be associated with the $200,000 grant to improve parking along Brockman Street in Pemberton. The former coalition government also helped to improve accessibility at the town hall in Northcliffe and upgrade their heritage museum. Under the Mobile Black Spot Program, phone towers were built at 10 Manjimup locations, including base stations at Beedelup east, Mount Frankland west and Windy Harbour. At Windy Harbour, the daily pilgrimage to the top of Point d'Entrecasteaux, where a faint mobile signal once provided patchy reception, has now ceased. Locals and visitors can now access a strong signal from the comfort of their holiday huts in the heart of the settlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, Andrew received the WALGA Local Government Distinguished Officer Award in recognition of his contribution as CEO and as a Manjimup shire officer for 26 years up to that point. Like me, Andrew has a passion for regional economic development. He helped drive Manjimup's transformation from a great timber-producing area to a supplier of fine food to local, national and international markets. Having helped navigate the shire's recovery from the devastating bushfires in 2015, Andrew now moves to Northampton, which was hit by Cyclone Seroja in 2021. As CEO of the Shire of Northampton, in the electorate of Durack, he will play a key role in the ongoing recovery from the destruction wreaked by Seroja. I'll miss working with Andrew. He has left a lasting legacy in Manjimup. Last week I visited Manjimup to personally thank Andrew and wish him all the best for the next chapter in his life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  Child care will get cheaper for 1.2 million Australians in just 100 days time, thanks to the Albanese government. We know that Australians are under the pump from cost-of-living pressures, and we are taking action to help reduce the load. As a parent, I know how important the first five years of a child's life are in their development and in their long-term mental and physical wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government was elected on a platform of delivering cheaper child care to fix the broken childcare system left by the former government. Under the former government's watch, childcare costs in Australia increased by 41 per cent over eight years. We are fixing the mess that they have left us. We've passed legislation to make child care cheaper for 1.2 million families starting from 1 July this year. We've invested $4.5 billion to give Australian children the best start to life and to allow parents, particularly women, the ability to return to work as soon as they are comfortable. We've lifted the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning $80,000 or less. We've increased the subsidy rate for around 96 per cent of families earning under $530,000 with a child in child care. As a result, a family on the median combined income of $120,000 with one child in early childhood education will save around $1,780 a year. The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has also asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate the factors impacting the supply and cost of childcare services. The ACCC will deliver their final report by the end of 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To see the impact of the Albanese government's action to make child care cheaper for 1.2 million Australians, I recently visited the Goodstart childcare facility in Point Cook. I toured the facilities and saw firsthand how proper investment in early childhood set up our children for a brighter future. But the staff at Goodstart also told me about the challenges that they're facing, including the trouble of attracting and retaining good quality childcare workers due to intense competition with other centres and the need to improve the quality of education and training for future childcare staff to deliver the best outcome for Australian kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that over 10,000 families in my electorate currently receive a childcare subsidy. Our increase in the childcare subsidy will benefit the vast majority of these families, which will, in turn, improve the prospects and happiness of these kids and their parents. The children in Melbourne's west have the potential to achieve great things, from becoming doctors or successful business owners to being political leaders like Julia Gillard or, hopefully, premiership-winning Western Bulldogs players. With our investment in child care, the Albanese government is giving the children of Melbourne's west every opportunity to reach their full potential in life, whatever they choose to do. I would like to thank Goodstart's fantastic staff who showed me around their facilities, including Melissa, Jo-Ann, Manpreet and Makayla. I would also like to thank the Goodstart students, who presented me with a beautiful piece of artwork. Thanks, kids.</span>

Regional universities are so important. Without them, I wouldn't be here. I had the good fortune to pursue a degree in agricultural science. Fortunately, thanks to the commitment of the University of Melbourne, that agricultural science degree was available in a place called Dookie in my electorate and I was able to study for a Bachelor of Applied Science in agriculture. Later in life, I wanted to come back and do some further study. Thanks to the commitment of La Trobe University, who were running a regional MBA program, I was able to complete a regional MBA program in Shepparton, in my home town, working full time and going to night school from six to nine. Regional universities are important, so the governments of the day continue to commit to those universities that are prepared to commit to regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One great example, also in my electorate, is the Department of Rural Health at the University of Melbourne. The Department of Rural Health is a great collaboration between La Trobe University and the University of Melbourne. Students can do a Bachelor of Biomedicine as an undergraduate degree in regional areas of Victoria, and then they can graduate to a postgraduate Doctor of Medicine, all in Shepparton, studying in Shepparton and going over the road to get some practical, hands-on experience in the hospital, Goulburn Valley Health. It's a great initiative that the former coalition government created and facilitated, and there are a multitude of young medical students now who are making their home in the Goulburn Valley and are going to be fantastic regional GPs. They're going to stay because they've put down roots. There's data that shows that where people train is where they work. I met some of those students last week. We're so rapt to have them in our community. As everyone will be aware, GP shortages in the regions have been a continuing problem. This is a solid solution that is going to fix that, and we're going to see 40 new GPs per year graduating, as of the end of next year, coming out and flourishing in our regional areas.</span>

                  </a>  Yes. We'll be sharing them everywhere! The point is that they will be regionally based. We have another great initiative on the books. That has worked so well that we want to do it with allied health. La Trobe University and Goulburn Valley Health have a great initiative to create a clinical health school. We made a commitment to it before the last election. I am hoping that the Labor government can see its way to support this fantastic initiative that will mean that there are more allied health and more nursing staff in our aged-care facilities and in our hospitals—regional kids going to regional universities, doing jobs that are desperately needed in the regions. I commend the project to all in this place.</span>

Global warming has increased at an unprecedented rate over the past decade. By the 2030s, every region in the world is expected to face increasing risks from climate change. We know that this will have a devastating impact on our communities, just as my community saw last year during the unprecedented February floods.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of denial and delay, Australia finally has a federal government that is committed to taking serious action on climate change, not just talking about it. As part of our Powering Australia plan, the Albanese government is investing in the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean energy industries through our $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund. At least $600 million of this will assist safeguard facilities in reducing their emissions through energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower-carbon processes or fuel switching to electrification, hydrogen and biofuels. The safeguard mechanism laws are the first chance to implement the transformative climate action that my community has been begging for, real action that actually gets us down to net zero after a decade of delay and dysfunction.</span>

Volunteers are the backbone of our community and their selfless contributions make all of our lives better. While we know these volunteers do not do their work for the credit, their hard work does deserve to be recognised and appreciated. If you know a Lilley resident, business or community group who deserves to be recognised for their volunteer work and community spirit, please nominate them for a Lilley volunteer award. Award recipients will be announced during National Volunteers Week in May.</span>

The pram pro-am running of the babies is back this year, hopefully with a drier track than last year. My twins are sporting several more kilos than last year, so we are not the favourites. If you're taking up the challenge, make sure to bring your A game and strap your baby into their pram, as there will be prizes up for grabs for the winners. Free activities will also be available for the kids at Welcoming the Babies, including a petting zoo, a jumping castle, facepainting and arts and crafts. There will also be early education information stalls for mums and dads and, I hear, a visit from the Easter Bunny. See you there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  I rise to speak about Drynan Drive in Calliope and the Widgee 'say no to the powerlines' rally that was held recently. After years of advocacy, I welcome the start of the construction of the upgrade Drynan Drive and Dawson Highway intersection in Calliope. The intersection has daily high-traffic flows, including frequent truck movements, with the road often crossed by schoolchildren. Many locals I have spoken to have told me how dangerous this intersection is, especially during morning and afternoon drop-off times. Unfortunately, I have had to drag the Labor government kicking and screaming to commit to this project. Labor's own Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mark Bailey, in 2021 clearly did not consider the project a priority, replying to one of my letters that this 'must compete against statewide priorities'. It took 97 days for the minister to reply to this letter. I consider the safety of the Calliope community paramount and I am glad the upgrade of Drynan Drive is finally underway.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On March 17, I attended the community rally at Widgee near Gympie, where over 200 people are vehemently against high-voltage transmission lines crossing their land. They came out to protest and seek help from their government representatives. This is exactly what I spoke about in my maiden speech.  The impact of renewable energy projects, including transmission lines, will be enormous, and this is just the beginning. The virtue-signalling inner-city population do not have a clue of what massive renewable projects are meaning for our local communities. If the Labor Party are to achieve their 82 per cent renewable energy target by 2030, their own estimates require 22,000 solar panels to be installed every day between now and 2030. This will equate to some 40 million solar panels. There will be 40 wind turbines required to be built every month between now and 2030—approximately 4,000 in total. All this goes along with 28,000 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines to connect these projects to the grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And does metropolitan Australia have an understanding of the impact that this will have on rural Australia? Next month Liddell power station will close, and in 2025 it is proposed that Eraring power station close, and I predict that the lights will go out in metropolitan Australia. Only then, when it's too late, will the inner-city zealots understand the energy fiasco that has been created by this sensible, unachievable rush to renewable energy. I say: do not close any power generation resources until equal generation capacity has been built. To do so will have consequences for business, industry and the householder that will not easily be fixed. I feel as if I'm the lookout on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>, screaming, 'Iceberg! Iceberg!' and nobody's listening. So I say once again that I believe we as Australians are on the road to an energy-generating crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I rise to congratulate and commend the Prime Minister on his recent visit to India and, with this, pay tribute to the Indian community in my electorate. My community welcomes the further strengthening of the bilateral relationship between Australia and India that was announced at the Annual Leaders Summit in New Delhi between the two prime ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an active and vibrant Indian diaspora here in Australia, contributing to all walks of life in our country. Their contribution on many social, economic and cultural fronts has made a significant impact to communities right across Australia, including in my own electorate. The engagement of our Indian community in my electorate and their participation within groups and civil society have been of great benefit to our local constituency, and we are all the better for it. On the diplomatic front, our engagement with India and people-to-people links have been very important contemporary pillars for Australia's ability to build its research capacity. They have also been very important to our ability to develop many of the key sectors that have supported the growth of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has been particularly important to the Australian Indian community, and I'm pleased that education was a key focus of the Annual Leaders Summit. The new agreement, which supports mutual recognition of education qualifications, is very much welcomed. Coupled with the progress being made on a new migration and mobility partnership arrangement, this will have a very positive impact on our people-to-people links, which should always be at the forefront of diplomatic engagement with our region and with the global community. The agreement is very important to our onshore international education sector and will encourage the mobility of students, graduates and professionals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke earlier of the obstructions faced by and constraints on newly arrived migrants, and having the migration and mobility partnership arrangement placed at the top of the Prime Minister's agenda as part of his visit reflects how acutely aware this government is of the challenges and opportunities before us. Ours is a government that understands that engagement with our region and the world is not a spectator sport and that this engagement is underpinned by an appreciation that our modern Australia shares characteristics and values of a similar nature to those present in our neighbourhood and our source countries of migration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit was a mark of the enduring friendship between our two countries and was a transformational step of benefit to both Australia and India, with a focus on new jobs and mutual opportunities. I want to congratulate the Prime Minister on the success of his visit. I share in my community's optimism for the future of our enduring bilateral relationships, and I do so in particular because almost one-third of people living in my constituency of Calwell are from the Subcontinent, particularly from India but also from neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. They are the new Australians of the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms </span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">THWAITES</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  Many people in my community are rightly concerned about access to health care, particularly when it comes to being able to see a GP at the moment. I want to thank all the locals in my community who have taken the time to contact me and share their concern and their experiences about how difficult it is to see a GP and, in particular, to access a bulk-billing service. I want to thank the hardworking GPs who have also come to see me to explain how they feel stretched and burnt out and not sure how long they can continue for. I know that having timely access to health care has real impacts on people 's health and life. A deferred trip to a GP because of unavailability or cost can mean serious consequences down the track. And of course it's not just individuals who suffer because of this. We all suffer when our community is unhealthy, health problems are left to crisis point and our busy hospitals are stretched even further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't get to this point by accident. There were nine long years of cuts to and neglect of Medicare under the previous Liberal-National governments, including, most significantly, a six-year freeze on the Medicare rebate. The result of this is that it is harder than ever to see a doctor, particularly a GP. It has never been more expensive to see a doctor. For the first time in the 40-year history of Medicare, the average gap fee for a standard GP consult is now more than the Medicare rebate itself. This cannot go on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has sent me here with a very clear message, which I'm taking to the Minister for Health and Aged Care and which I'm raising here: that we must invest in our health care. We must make it easier to get access to GPs and good health care in our communities. I know that, unlike with previous Liberal-National governments, these calls are not falling on deaf ears. Labor is the party of Medicare. We created Medicare and we will always protect it. Our government has no higher priority than strengthening Medicare and rebuilding general practice to ensure that Australians get the care they need, when and where they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After nine long years of cuts to and neglect of Medicare, particularly that six-year Medicare rebate freeze, we know that this is not going to be a quick solution. We know it's not going to be easy, but we are committed to making it work. We are committed to fixing Medicare. I want to reassure residents in my community: whether you're in Eltham, Greensborough or Heidelberg—right through my electorate—we know that you want to be able to see a GP when and where you need it. You want it to be affordable. You don't want to be left in a position where you have to go to an emergency room. The investments our government are making, the $750 million to deliver the highest-priority investments in primary care and the investments we will make in the budget in May, are important. They are all part of our efforts to strengthen and fix Medicare after it was neglected for too long under the Liberals and Nationals.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I rise to speak on this important work. I commend the report and the work of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards. I'd like to thank, in particular, the secretariat and the members of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards, including my Independent colleague Kylea Tink, the member for North Sydney, who has been working on it. This is really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For context: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the standard</span> review done by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins shocked the nation. I think it's fair to say it shocked most of us in here—I hope—but it also shocked the nation with the wide scale and the level of discrimination, abuse, disrespect, harassment and even allegations of assault, including sexual assault, in the parliamentary workplace. I think it was a pretty low bar for the Commonwealth workplace. Now the endeavour is to make sure that that can never be the case again and that we set much better standards, as Commissioner Jenkins aptly named her report. This place is setting the laws and the rules for the rest of the country that so many other workplaces must comply with. This place should be the gold standard that other workplaces aspire to. What was made so clear in that report is that it's very far from that. This place has a long way to go. I think parliamentarians need to take this on board and take responsibility for the workplace that we are creating and a part of. We need to set a standard of behaviour that can be the gold standard around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the standard</span> report by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner was the development of a code of conduct for parliamentarians. The committee that issued this report was formed to develop that code of conduct and the standards for parliamentarians. Since coming into this place in 2019 I have been advocating for a code of conduct. I must say the lack of a code was one of the things I was most shocked about in coming into this place from the bar, where of course there is a code of conduct and there is practice. One of the main exams you pass to become a barrister is on ethics. So it was quite surprising to know that there is no code of conduct in this place. I think it's pretty much the only workplace remaining without such a standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the motion for the establishment of a code of conduct for parliamentarians today. It's important progress and something I very strongly support. It is an important benchmark we can all measure ourselves against and hold ourselves to. I greatly appreciate the work of all involved in bringing it to this point. Kate Jenkins, as Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, welcomed the development of the codes. When they were endorsed by the parliament, she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is an historic moment. Federal Parliament has never had codes of conduct. They are an important tool to help ensure parliament is a safe, respectful workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the recommendations. I was pleased to see the commitment of all parties to the implementation of the behaviour standards for Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces and the behaviour code for parliamentarians. That was recommendation 2. I look forward to the creation of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission, as recommended in both this report and the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> report, to support the full implementation of the codes. That is recommendation 5. I also welcome the adoption of the interim codes of conduct until that body is established. That is recommendation 3.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that upon the creation of the standards commission we will seek to implement all recommendations, particularly 6 and 7, to establish a clear understanding of the roles of parliamentarians with respect to the codes and impose sanctions for not complying. Unfortunately, we know that there needs to be deterrence, and so for codes of conduct to really bite there need to be consequences when they are ignored. So I support the establishment of a body to oversee and conduct reviews into the implantation and enforcement of the standards, as per recommendation 10.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that there also be protection against vexatious claims and frivolous and unreasonable complaints under the codes and that policies be established to inform people of these policies, as per recommendation 14. I also strongly support recommendation 16, which recommends a proactive approach to training and education when implementing the codes. It is really important that not only staff but parliamentarians be aware of and properly understand the expectations that arise from the code.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 9 of the report—key to the success of the transformation of this place—is that staff be aware of the changes that are being made and be involved in the process of driving change. The staff consultative group is an important element. As a member of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, I am pleased with the progress towards the establishment of a staff consultative group. It will assist in the amplification of the message, it will drive increased participation in decision-making and it will increase buy-in to the solutions developed. I do say to staff across this place and in everyone's electoral offices: it is important to engage with this process. Unless we get your feedback, unless we hear from you, the solutions can't be developed and put in place. It is really important that staff have buy-in, that they feel empowered and that they feel heard so that they can speak up when the circumstances and situations require it.</span>

I welcome the appointment of Dr Vivienne Thom as the new chair of the task force and I look forward to working with her throughout this term. I thank her and the secretariat for their hard work.</span>

I think it will be a step forward to ensuring that the Commonwealth parliamentary workplace is a respectful workplace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  As I rise to speak today, back home in my electorate of Indi at Waminda Community House in Benalla the weekly food relief session is beginning. Each week, families drop into Waminda to pick up fresh fruit and vegetables and other food for their households, a service that helps those struggling to make ends meet. We hear a lot in this place about the rising cost of living, but places like Waminda are where people are really feeling it. Last week when I visited Waminda, the manager there, Leeane Bullard, told me that demand for the food relief service is slowly but surely rising. At Waminda people take what they need for food relief, and Leeane says both the number of people and the amount of food being collected are increasing as conditions get more and more difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently visited Albury Wodonga Regional FoodShare, where the story is very similar. The number of people seeking out their services is going up, including people from more backgrounds, people who are really struggling. I met with volunteer coordinator Sue Thornton and chair Simon Welsh, and they told me they were staggered by the change in people seeking help from their service. It's people who are working, it's single mums with kids and mortgages, and there just isn't enough money to pay for food, the roof over their heads and the bills they have to cope with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are community houses and food shares across my electorate who are telling the same story. More people are needing help, and time and time again they are stepping up to meet that demand. People are heading off to work, contributing to our communities, but there is no guarantee there will be enough for them. Albury Wodonga Regional FoodShare says that across its region there are 22,230 people living in poverty, and that includes 4,942 children. This is defined by those with a household income of less than $368 per week. It's hard to fathom, but this is the reality. In their catchment, on any given day at least 2,223 people require food assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and our communities are indebted to these neighbourhood houses and food shares because they are filling the gap when policy fails. The cost of living goes up and up, and yet the rate of JobSeeker and other welfare payments barely shifts. It is charities, neighbourhood houses and others that are stepping into the breach. This week we saw the launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Ending Poverty, and the message from the Reverend Tim Costello and economist Chris Richardson was clear: an increase in welfare payments in the May budget is long overdue. Mr Richardson said that the single unemployment benefit as a percentage of full-time wage earnings has dropped from 24 per cent in 1990 to 18.5 per cent today. Amongst OECD countries, Australia is second lowest, after Greece, in unemployment benefits as a percentage of full-time earnings. A new study released this week from the University of New South Wales and the Australian Council of Social Service found 60 per cent of people on the JobSeeker payment, 72 per cent of people on the parenting payment and 34 per cent of people on youth allowance lived in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do better to support the most vulnerable in our society. Neighbourhood houses, charities and food shares play an important role, but we can't keep expecting more and more of them to do this if the government won't also step up. I want to say thank you to every neighbourhood house, food share, charity and organisation in my electorate of Indi that is ensuring people in our committees have fresh fruit and vegetables, that they don't go hungry, that they have sanitary items, that they have dignity. You are a vital but often unseen part of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon we will see the first report from the new Economic Inclusion Advisory Panel on the adequacy of income support payments. The panel was set up following a sensible amendment from Independent Senator David Pocock last year, and I thank him for that very important work. I think we know what the panel will say about the state and the rate of JobSeeker and other payments, and I certainly hope that this government will finally listen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Flying from Perth to Canberra on Sunday last week, I was fortunate to share a flight with the great singer-songwriter Paul Kelly. He was on his way home from performing in Perth at the Red Hot Summer Tour. Along with other Aussie icons like Bernard Fanning, Missy Higgins and Mark Seymour, he got to perform to a terrific crowd at the Sandalford winery, which happens to be in my electorate of Hasluck. It is an extraordinarily beautiful vineyard, and I had the good fortune to have lunch last week with Peter Prendiville, the family owner of the winery, and CEO Grant Brinklow. Firstly, I congratulate them for being a recipient of the Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant program. It's a testament to the investment that they have put in, which is being backed in and matched by federal funding. It was also an opportunity to understand their business aspirations for the area and their ideas on how we can fully capitalise on the value that comes from the Swan Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I appreciate that Sandalford is one of the larger vineyards in the valley, I have also taken time over these past 10 months to meet with a number of different businesses, including the myriad of businesses that support the Swan Chamber of Commerce, whose functions I enjoy regularly. I met with Andrea Romeo of Mondo Nougat, who has been a very strong advocate for making sure that the NBN and mobile phone coverage support the business needs of the area. Unlike some other parts, particularly across metropolitan Perth and the peri-urban area, this is not a built-up, densely populated area, so it has been neglected for the last 10 years. We want to make sure that they have the support that they need to operate well because, whilst there are few businesses and few residents, the number of people that visit the region—half a million people a year—means they need access to the same services as everyone else. That is particularly so when doing transactions on EFTPOS and when running regular business but also when taking selfies to share to Instagram and TikTok. That's the way businesses are promoted. So we need to make sure that both the businesses and those visiting are able to have the full experience and then share it beyond to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Understanding the value of the Swan Valley as well as the Perth Hills—the two of which have a strong alignment in terms of culture and history and the issues and challenges that we really want to work through—really does require coordinated development. The reality is that there are very few places in the world where just 15 to 20 kilometres from the city you can be amongst this beautiful area to enjoy and recreate. We really want to begin understanding how we can corral the issues together and have a constructive way forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these issues are big. We're making significant investments in road and transport infrastructure. The intent is to make the roads more efficient so people spend less time driving. That is fantastic, but this particular area is essentially a tourist trail. So we need to be sensitive to how we manage and balance the needs of people trying to navigate from east to west and north to south while also being mindful that this is a very precious tourist precinct and we want to keep that experience intact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already alluded to the communications, but, both in the valley and up in the hills, the reliability is very ad hoc. In the hills, it's largely a terrain issue; it's very difficult for the regular towers to get through. So we are increasingly using satellites to address that problem. We are using science and technology to make advances there. Thankfully, the government has got a significant commitment to fix the NBN, so I'll be very pleased over the course of this term to see those issues resolved once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public transport is also essential. My own parents, who I'm very pleased are actually here in the gallery with me today, lived out in Ellenbrook around 2006. My parents are very frequent users of public transport; it is their preferred means of travelling whenever possible. Sadly, the funding for the METRONET rail to get out to Ellenbrook was never backed in to support the state at that time, so the project was continually delayed. Thankfully, it's back on track. The station is being built now, so we do expect the opportunity for people to be able to travel— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a vibrant community—a community that relies heavily on the tourism trade. The whale shark swimming season started earlier this month. Opportunities to swim with these magnificent creatures are very rare, with the Ningaloo region being, I believe, the only place in Australia where, indeed, you can do this. Incidentally, a little-known fact about these gentle giants of the sea is that they are not actually whales but the largest fish in the ocean. Whale sharks can grow to an incredible 12 metres in length and can weigh up to 21.5 tonnes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Exmouth has long been a Defence town. It was established in 1964 to provide support to the Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt and to house dependent families of US Navy personnel. Today, Exmouth has a population of around 2,000, which can swell to over 6,000 during the height of the tourism season. The colours and sea life in and around Ningaloo Reef draw visitors from all over the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to the drawcard of Exmouth's famous natural attractions, in just under a month's time visitors to Exmouth will have front-row seats to one of nature's most phenomenal occurrences, a total solar eclipse. This is an extraordinary and rare astronomical event that represents a unique opportunity for Western Australia and, indeed, Australia. On 20 April 2023 at 11.27 am the shadow of the moon will graze the tip of Western Australia in a 40-kilometre-wide track as it travels over the Ningaloo region near Exmouth, making it the most accessible land based place on earth to view this spectacle. Visitors and astronomy lovers alike will be able to experience day turn to night. The process of the moon moving across the face of the sun takes three hours, but the brief moments of totality when the sun is completely obscured by the moon will last only 62 seconds. This is a spectacle that will not occur again in this area in our lifetime, so I encourage people to visit Exmouth during this time and experience this for yourselves. You will not be disappointed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Exmouth community, understandably, are very proud of where they live, and they have a very deep passion for their town. Like many other regional towns, the Exmouth community is currently facing a severe housing shortage. This is coupled with intensive migration growth. According to Regional Australia Institute data, Exmouth is the only Western Australian local government area north of Perth on the list of Australia's four areas with the largest increase in migration. But the housing shortage is hindering the town's development and causing significant frustration amongst locals. Local businesses are unable to secure staff due to these shortages. But it is just as important for our essential workers. We're seeing nurses and teachers having to stay in limited hotel accommodation. Families and would-be residents alike are struggling to find any kind of accommodation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I had the great pleasure of travelling to Exmouth. I met with the local shire, the chamber of commerce, many local businesses, many local residents and, of course, those wonderful volunteer groups. I don't mind saying that these passionate Exmouth locals are incredibly frustrated by the housing issues in their town. The one concern that they all had in common was the lack of land being released. I believe the land available for release is being held up by previously expired native title processes or by a failure to implement the necessary flood mitigation measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, we need our state government to lift its game, so I'm calling on Minister John Carey, the housing minister in the WA state parliament, to make it a priority. Please, liaise with the local shire and hasten the land title lease processes to provide and make available more land. More could and should be done to help this community to grow. That's what it wants. Exmouth deserves so much better from the McGowan government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Today is a cold, fairly miserable, drizzly day in Canberra. It is the morning after the night before. What a disgraceful night it was last night in the main chamber, when we were in debate for the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill. I reflected, as a first-term MP in the first ten months of my first term, on what it means to represent a community and the things that matter to them. In my community of Chisholm the environment really matters, and taking action on climate change really matters. I thought that everyone in this place stood for parliament so that they could do what was required in the best interests of this nation. Last night we saw a pretty childish display from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect very seriously on the fact that the IPCC released a report yesterday morning. I, like so many in my community and, I expect, in other communities across this country, was horrified to realise that time is running out to take meaningful action on climate. We put forward legislation in the House of Representatives that those opposite not only refused to support but spent last night disrupting, delaying and making a mockery of. When history looks back to this moment in time, it will see those who treated action on climate as a joke and those who seriously tried to make a difference for the survival of this planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time I have a mobile office, climate change is raised as one of the most important issues in my community. I reflect back to the election campaign, when my opponent, from the former government, refused to attend a climate change forum. For too long this issue has not been treated seriously by those opposite, and when given the opportunity to come together as a parliament, as parliaments across the world do, those opposite refused. It's actually a really normal thing to come together to take action on climate change in other places, but unfortunately not here. That is a real shame for our country, and it is a real stain on the history of their party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a ridiculous, petty, petulant, entitled performance that we were treated to last night, and families across the country will have seen it. Perhaps I could plead to the better natures of those opposite to do better in the future, but if that's not enough—if appealing to their conscience is not enough—perhaps they will look to their electoral self-interest. Perhaps they will realise that the community has handed a mandate to our government to take action on the climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my very first speech in this place I spoke of Pat and John, a lovely couple I met just near the Wattle Park shops in my electorate. They were so concerned about climate and integrity and the future that their grandchildren would inherit. Every time I go to an early childhood education place, I speak to children about the need to look after the environment; in fact, this is the issue they raise with me. The local ACF group in Chisholm, Baby Boomers for Climate Change Action in my electorate, the Tomorrow Movement, Lighter Footprints, and school students—environmental captains in their schools—raise the importance of climate change action with me all the time. I know I'm not the only MP who gets asked these questions. I'm sure those opposite do too, and I really do wonder how they answer such questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maya Angelou has a really fantastic quote that I think of often when I think of those opposite: 'When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.' I hope the people of Australia see what they're shown by those opposite: not just their failure to take action climate change but their turning what was an important moment for this nation and for energy policy into a joke by trying to shut down the debate in parliament, by trying to find the tactics to make sure we can't take this issue seriously as a country. It was a disgrace, and they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  For the information of the member who just spoke, it is the Labor Party in opposition that holds the record for the largest number of times divisions and quorums have been called and the bells have been made to ring in this place since Federation, so I think it's a bit precious to make those types of comments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on the road last week doing what's collectively known as 'Pitt stops' all over the Hinkler electorate—in Urangan, Pialba and Burrum, Buxton, Woodgate, Childers, lots of places in Bundaberg and all over the show. People were very much concerned about power prices and about the cost of living—the No. 1 issue for all of them. I represent a lot of people who do not have a lot of money at their disposal. Every single time costs go up it makes their lives far more difficult than they need to be. For them, that was the No. 1 issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At No. 2 was the Voice, and they were almost unanimously opposed, apart from one individual who had some sympathy for one element out of the three but would oppose it anyway if the three were put forward in the current format. In no surprise to me, they are tired of getting 20, 30 or 10 welcomes to country at every event they go to. They have no issue with someone making that acknowledgement, but to have it from every speaker in every format and in every videoconference was something that quite simply they did not think was necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They support a nuclear industry. What we know is that federal Labor, with a commitment through AUKUS—a security arrangement which clearly we originally negotiated and secured—will have a nuclear industry in Australia. That's the bottom line. It's already here. You'll have the people, you will have the facilities, you will have to deal with waste and you will have to lift the moratorium; that's a statement of fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do these 'Pitt stops' twice a year where I can, and sometimes no-one shows up. Sometimes I get two, three, 10, 15, 20 or 30. But at Burrum Heads, which is in the middle of my electorate, a beautiful coastal village at the heads of the Barwon River, I got 63 people showing up for a roadside. For that to happen, there has to be a serious issue for all of them. I thank them all for turning out. It's not a federal issue. It's not one for which I could take much action other than raising it here—that is, a flying fox colony at Burrum Heads. It's their belief that the colony moved from Fraser Island when it was severely burnt out in a fire last year or the year before, if I recall correctly, which, in my view, could have been put out but they were prevented from using saltwater to put out the fire. They had to fly and take from the freshwater supply inland, which slowed the delivery by helicopters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of all that, the community is incredibly concerned about this very large flying fox colony around a lagoon at their small township. To give you an idea of some of the impact, one of the residents raised with me the fact that all her now deceased husband wanted to do was sit on his back deck of his home in his last days and hours and he simply couldn't because of the flying fox population. Those of you who have ever dealt with them know that they smell awful, they are incredibly noisy and it is just not manageable. For this issue to have not been dealt with by local and state governments, in my view, is an absolute disgrace. They have had ample time. There are well-known methods to move on flying fox colonies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since when did the amenity of a flying fox colony become more important than that of the human population in a town centre? We deal with these issues in the Northern Territory, in North Queensland and, in fact, all over the place. Australia is a really big country. There are lots of places for flying fox colonies to be based where they don't have this interaction. The idea that you can't move them on, that there is not a process, is wrong. I am advised that there are steps that can be taken. I have written to council. I have written to the state member. They both responded; although one responded by saying, 'We'll get back to you in 28 days.' The state MP did call my office and said they had raised the matter with the department of environment. I say to the state Labor member: that is great, but how about they do something? This is a fundamental problem for the people who live there. It smells bad. Their houses get covered in faeces. It's incredibly noisy. It directly impacts their amenity and the way that they live their life in what is a beautiful seaside village.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say again to Fraser Coast council and to the Queensland Labor government: stop messing about. Pick up the phone, call one another and sort this out. For me to get 60 people at a roadside says this is a massive issue locally that needs to be fixed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  I welcome the opportunity today to provide an update on the Bombala community's Currawarna assisted living proposal. Last year we saw the Currawarna aged-care centre close its doors after 43 years of operation. The centre was built by the community. It was a much-loved facility in that community and was proudly supported by the Bombala and Monaro communities. It was a victim of staff shortages and the changing structure of aged care. I was upset and frustrated last year, as were so many people in that community, when the Morrison government stood by and did nothing when the facility closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the strength of this regional community has meant that it started the #standwithcurrawarna Facebook page. They formed a committee, and they've now got a proposal, the Currawarna assisted living proposal, which utilises the existing facility to provide affordable supported housing for those who are unable to continue to live at home independently. The facility would have access to the care-at-home packages from the My Aged Care program, as well as to NDIS packages, to provide services on the premises, while the cost of residential living will be paid for by the residents without the need for residential aged-care deposits. The committee envisage that this will also support in the delivery of home-care and NDIS packages to the wider community by centralising the demand in a central location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was extremely pleased that Steve Whan, the Labor candidate for Monaro in the upcoming state election, committed a Minns Labor government to fully fund this community driven project, a commitment that will build on the incredible efforts of the community, who have already fundraised over $200,000 to get this up and running. The community know that it will take about $1 million of working capital to get this facility open, and they have got there with the commitment from Steve Whan. This project needs to go ahead. It doesn't need more political gameplaying. We know that this fits directly into the state government's responsibilities in assisted living. Without the need for continued federal funding, this commitment gets this centre open. I look forward to Saturday coming along and those residents of Bombala and the Monaro district being able to vote for a proposal to get this back open for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today also to discuss the Australian government's landmark national cultural policy Revive: A place for every story, a story for every place, which was released in January this year. It's a five-year plan to renew and revive Australia's arts, entertainment and culture sector. It delivers the momentum that Australia's creative workers, organisations and audiences need to continue to thrive and grow so that our arts, culture and heritage are repositioned as central to Australia's future. The mighty Eden-Monaro is full of stories of renewal and revival, and I'd like to highlight just a few of those today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three years on from the Black Summer bushfire, artists Nat Ord and Vanessa Keenan have collaborated to produce <span style="font-style:italic;">Mid Stories</span>, a multi-artform exhibition that explores the impact of the fires on our landscape and our community. It uses photography, video, solargraphy, augmented reality and installation to show the destruction and the regeneration of the Batlow area. Having lived through the Black Summer fires, Vanessa and Nat used their experience to inspire their art.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regeneration Roadtrip, which was developed by Navigate Arts, was an arts road trip from Canberra to the far South Coast. It showcased the incredible arts across many towns and communities of Eden-Monaro. Hosted in September and October last year, the self-guided road trip included stopovers at concerts, exhibitions, installations and workshops. Yuin artist Warren Foster Sr recreated and installed a scar tree for the Regeneration Roadtrip project. He held talks to explain the significance of scar trees in First Nations cultures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals recognise the immense value of the sector to our economy, to our community and to our culture. Revive will empower talented artists and arts organisations like Nat, Vanessa and Warren and organisations like Navigate Arts to thrive and to grow, unlocking new opportunities, reaching new audiences and telling stories in a compelling way. On that note I give a quick shout-out to local Braidwood artist John R Walker, who has just had his artwork <span style="font-style:italic;">Eagle Spir</span><span style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Vathiwarta</span> acquired for the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. How lucky is it that all of us get to see this local art in our national collection, something everyone in the mighty Eden-Monaro can be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'll give a quick shout-out to the Sapphire Coast Skatepark Association. This organisation has been working for years, trying to get a renewed skate park in the township of Merimbula. We're now a step closer. The council has confirmed that it will back Ford Park as the location. I give a shout-out to Peter O'Keefe, in particular, who has been driving this project for a number of years. Our election commitment of $500,000 will see stage 1 of that project delivered in Merimbula.</span>
