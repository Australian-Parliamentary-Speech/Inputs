         —In April of this year a delegation of this parliament led by the President of the Senate, Senator Michael Beahan, visited Canada and the United States of America. Apart from myself, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) were the members of this place who were on that delegation. The delegation had a broad threefold purpose: first, to assess the political developments in the United States, in particular since the 1994 congressional elections, which returned a majority to the Republican Party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives; secondly, to promote trade between Australia, the United States and Canada, particularly agricultural trade by Australia—in that context we were most interested in the progress of the United States Farm Bill through the congress; and, thirdly, to promote Australia as the location for regional headquarters for the United States and Canadian companies operating in Asia.

         The delegation visited Ottawa for three days, where we met with many officials, including an almost hour-long meeting with the Rt Hon. Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Hon. Roy MacLaren, the Minister for Trade and the Hon. Raymond Chan, the Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific. The visit marked the centenary of trading agreements between Australia and Canada. Unfortunately our time in Canada was limited because of parliamentary terms in the three countries and the need to try to visit both Ottawa and Washington while the respective parliaments and congresses were in session.

         Our visit to Washington coincided with one of the most remarkable periods in recent United States history. As honourable members will know, on 8 November 1994 Bill Clinton's presidency suffered a massive blow from a landslide Republican victory in the mid-term congressional elections. The Republican Party regained control in the Senate, which they had last held in 1986, and won a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954. The elections yielded both the first Republican dominated congress in 40 years and the worst performance by the Democratic Party since 1946. Some assessments credited the change to an anti-incumbency mood within the American electorate, but the fact remains that no incumbent Republican lost a seat.

         A number of reasons for the massive swing against the Democratic Party have been advanced. However, there can be little doubt that President Clinton's administration was also a major factor in the result. As a consequence of these elections President Clinton lost control of the domestic political agenda to the Republicans, with the new Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, quickly moving to fill the policy void by promising to enact his election manifesto, the so-called `Contract with America', in the first hundred days of the new congress, which commenced on 1 January 1995. Key elements of the contract include a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, term limits for federal politicians, large income and capital gains tax cuts, large welfare spending cuts, increased defence spending and a presidential line item veto on all expenditure bills.

         The members of the delegation were in Washington during the last few days of the 100 days legislative program. While most of the contract was passed by the House of Representatives, including legislation to preclude the federal government mandating programs or regulations upon a state without funding, two items were rejected—namely, the balanced budget amendment and term limits for politicians. While the major part of the contract passed through the House of Representatives, its progress since then has not been guaranteed in the Senate. The final outcome may have a lot to do with jockeying in the American election presidential campaign as much as any other factor. However, it has demonstrated a marked change in American politics over the last two years. As Governor Evan Bayh, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association said:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is apparent that there was a tidal wave running across the country and it hit the State House just as it hit the U.S. House. The American people are disenchanted with Governments. They don't want big government, bureaucracy or higher taxes, and they want to see progress towards solving the problems they encounter in their daily lives.

        During our visit, we were honoured to meet with the Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, representative Pat Roberts, the chair of the House Agricultural Committee, and representative Kika Garza, the minority member of the House Agricultural Committee, to talk about progress so far as the farm bill is concerned and to advance Australia's agricultural concerns. We also met with a series of other people in Washington, including members of leading think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Bill Kristol, the chairman of the Committee for a Republican Future, and Peter Hart, the leading Democratic Party pollster in Washington. The coalition members were also able to attend the Republican conference, the equivalent of our party meeting or caucus, which was addressed by Newt Gingrich.

         I want to make some very brief observations in this limited time. I commend the report to honourable members and members of the Australian public. The first relates to Chicago, where we visited. Chicago, which is in the state of Illinois, is the commercial centre of the mid-west of America. It is one area in which there is greatest trade between Australia and the United States. If one looks at exports to Australia by state, Illinois is second only to California. When you take in surrounding states such as Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and Minnesota, you see that that part of mid-west America is the centre of the most trade between Australia and the United States of America.

         We visited the futures market, the Environment Protection Agency, major corporations such as Motorola and McDonald's, and looked with a trade emphasis on Chicago. What surprised us was that Australia only has an honorary consulate at Chicago. Whereas there was previously an office with a staff of 27, Australia's interests in what is probably one of major parts of trading activities between Australia and the rest of the world are represented by one person, an honorary consul. Whilst we are not in any way decrying the activities of the honorary consul—we were most impressed by the activities of Mrs Joan Miller—it seemed totally absurd to all members of the delegation that this was the way in which Australia had representation in that part of the world, considering our great interests in it. There is an unanimous recommendation from the delegation that the government look to reopening a full consulate in Chicago.

         Secondly, we visited Boston. I want to say something in particular about our visit to Harvard University, where there is a chair in Australian studies. We were interested to hear about two aspects of the chair. The first is whether the funding of the endowment is realistic in light of change in the value of $1 million from when the endowment was made in 1976, and the second is whether the outcomes are consistent with the aims of the endowment. Casual conversations cannot replace a proper inquiry. The delegation noted that the discussions it held at Harvard raised questions about the funding and direction of the Australian studies chair.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of promoting awareness and understanding of Australia and the United States of America is worthy, even an essential aim, but can it be maximised with a $1 million capital purse? There seems to be doubt about this and doubts in our mind about the focus of the chair. We have recommended that the Australian government appoint a committee to review the funding administration of the Australian studies chair at Harvard. The review should ensure that the chair remains relevant to the Australian-United States relationship. In that context, I noted recently the establishment of an Australian-New Zealand studies centre at Georgetown University in America. I believe that that ought to be commended as an activity and a focus within the central part of government in America—namely, Washington.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the remaining moments available to me, I will reflect on the third aspect, which is the relationship between Australia and the United States. In the period since the end of the Second World War, every President from Dwight Eisenhower to George Bush, eight in all, served in the defence forces and therefore, in one way or another, had a connection with and a knowledge of Australia. President Bill Clinton is the first President since the end of the Second World War who does not fulfil that criteria, which in itself reflects a passing of a generation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Therefore, in order to maintain our connection with the United States of America, it is necessary not simply to rely in this 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on what happened during that war but, indeed, to renew that acquaintance and renew those ties in a very real way. We believe that these delegations every two years are important to do that. We would encourage Americans to come to Australia. We believe that they ought to be led by either the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate, giving some sense of the importance that we place on this relationship between Australia and the United States.

         Finally, may I extend my thanks to a number of people: High Commissioner Murray in Ottawa; Ambassador Russell in Washington; and, particularly, the Congressional Liaison Officer, Bob Tyson, who oversaw our delegation; Honorary Consuls Joan Miller in Chicago, Margaret Stanzler in Boston, and Mr Stephen Brown of Vorys Sater Seymour and Pease who arranged the visits to Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; and Judy Middlebrook, the assiduous secretary of the delegation. Finally, I extend my thanks to all the members of our very harmonious delegation under the leadership of the President of the Senate. I commend the report to the House.

The construction of a four storey office building with 12,800 square metres of net lettable area, basement and roof plant rooms. The construction of a three-level structured car park to accommodate 305 vehicles. Included in the car park will be 350 square metres of retail space, including food services. Associated engineering and landscape works will include 197 surface car parking spaces and a plaza, with paving adjacent to the retail area. The building will be designed to provide safe and suitable facilities and accommodation for the Department of Industrial Relations.

         —It is sad to see the ANL Sale Bill 1995 come before the parliament. Along with my colleagues the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), I am very reluctant to support such a bill because of the ramifications it has for shipping. It is sad to think that we will lose ANL, our national line. There is a good position for supporting the reconstruction of ANL, to throw off the old cast and build a new sleek, efficient and fast service which would serve Australia and Australian business in the future.

         The unions have agreed to this course of action. They have also agreed to put forward new ideas and concentrate on the routes that are important to us and can make money for us and drop those that are no longer economically viable in terms of competing with other lines. When you look at those lines and the ships of shame you come to realise how bad those lines are and find that it is the lowest common denominator that is driving the price of shipping throughout the world today. There are some shipping companies that strive for decent ships and there are those which make it very hard for the good ones to go forward and make a profit, and this is due to the quality of these ships of shame.

         This bill makes me unhappy, as did the legislation relating to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We are selling off the assets which are part of people's heritage. My electorate takes in the west coast of Tasmania. That is the area King O'Malley represented in the early parliament of our country. King O'Malley fought for and put together the Commonwealth Bank. It was very sad for me to see that bill go through the parliament. It is very interesting that King O'Malley was a teetotaller and yet spoke in many places—including the balcony of Hunters Hotel in Main Street, Queenstown. The only plaque that I can find of him is on Hunters Hotel in Queenstown. I spoke to representatives of the Commonwealth Bank some years ago about having a statue of King O'Malley erected. They did not seem to be overly interested in giving their founding father the recognition I felt he deserved.

         The working people of Australia have invested their assets in ANL and the Commonwealth Bank. These are the assets of the working people of our country. ANL is part of that. I have always been concerned that not enough of our export commodities—and we are an exporting nation; we have exported since nationhood—have been carried in Australian owned ships. We have only carried two or three per cent of those commodities out of Australia in Australian owned ships. This has to have a major effect on our economy and our trade figures. All the other business that is associated with foreign ships taking away our commodities—that is, the associated insurance and so on—must go against Australia's trade figures.

         As a nation we should be building ships. That should be very high on our agenda. I think it is a shame for the capital  markets of Australia that they have not been able to build up a major shipbuilding industry for our country. When you look at what we have done with the commodities we export such as coal, wheat and wool, it is shame that we lack a shipbuilding industry. I certainly hope things will emerge in future which will help this situation. I do not think selling ANL is the right way of achieving that goal.

         A considerable amount of work has been done into the development of new breeds of ships that can do 60 to 80 knots. If this becomes a reality in the future, it would transform shipping. These are concepts and ideas at the moment that I know people are looking at. But that sort of shipping would certainly compete with air transport in the future.

         In Tasmania we have had Incat develop the fast catamaran industry into a very successful exporter. In some areas those ships work very efficiently. The industry has added greatly to the economy of southern Tasmania. The government has been able to assist Incat in its training programs through Working Nation being utilised in that area. We have been able to put people into training positions at Incat, which is very positive not only for those individuals but also for that company's future. There is nothing so gratifying than to see people who have been out of work for three years ending up in a training position where they will learn new skills such as aluminium welding, which is on the edge of new technology.

         By not having our own ships, goods are at the whim of the international shipping market. We also have no window to see what is happening in international shipping and our national interest is lost. Any influence that Australia could have on change is also lost. By selling ANL we lose the opportunity of having that window into the world of international shipping, which I think is a great shame. The Japanese are very good at having an integrated system in their businesses. I have seen the way that the Japanese system operates in both the meat industry and the coal industry in Australia. The Japanese buy into a variety of areas so that they know exactly where the costs are and what the industries are about. By not having ANL in this country, we are going exactly the other way.

         In Australia we should set a high standard in our shipping. We should not accept the ships of shame as being the norm for international shipping. There are many problems when these flags of convenience countries—flags of shame, I call them—are setting some of the standards which are driving international shipping. We should not accept that. I have no hesitation in saying that Australia should be a leader with the standards that we set in shipping. We should not put up with shortcomings, particularly in safety, in a shipping company's mode of practice.

         The argument is about having a shipping line which is owned by Australia, employing Australians and having the highest standard of safety and efficiency, and being responsible to one's shipping line's flag and to one's country, so we have the conditions applying that are the normal conditions in the Australian work force. It can be seen as being the Australian way in the ports around the world. It means a lot to Australia, with a strong maritime history of hundreds of years. By selling ANL, we are selling a great part of our history. If the maritime unions and the ACTU and P&amp;O are unable to reach agreement on Australian conditions of employment and employment of Australian crews cannot take place, the bill will not go any further.

        I do not know how the member for Throsby expects the Australian people to be convinced by his arguments when he declines the opportunity to cross the floor and vote with the opposition. Indeed, these are the tactics the Labor Party has with many of its members. They feel disenfranchised and disillusioned by the Labor Party and are trying to hold themselves out as being independents in their own electorates when they are really the Keating candidates—the Keating members without whom the Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), cannot be in power.

         So it is most disappointing to see that the member for Throsby simply did not have the courage of his convictions to cross the floor when he had the opportunity. We provided that opportunity to the member specifically so that he could show his credentials were good and honest. He said that this was wrong in his belief, that he did not support the bill and that he did not support the government, but he did not have the courage of his convictions.

         At the end of the day, like all other Labor Party members who say that they are independents fighting for their electorate, when they get an opportunity to make their point by crossing the floor to give credence and evidence to what they say, they fail. Why is that? Is it because the Prime Minister of the day excites such fear and loathing among his colleagues that they fear that, if they cross the floor and give true expression to what they say, they will be expelled? That is the point. Under the Labor Party regime, they are totally and utterly unable to represent the interests of their own constituencies because they are not afforded the right to cross the floor when they believe in something with such passion. The member for Throsby obviously felt so strongly about it yesterday during his speech that he put out a press release which further stated:

         The other thing I did yesterday was to seek reassurances from the government on four undertakings relating to the nature and the structure of the bill, particularly the $15 million appropriation, the real purpose of which is not disclosed by the legislation.

         We, of course, are opposed to the way in which the government is seeking to use the parliament as a sausage machine to pump this legislation through prior to the election, obviously with a view to dampening down continued unhappiness in its ranks. We are in favour of privatisation of ANL. We believe that a private organisation could operate such an Australian line competitively and efficiently in such a way that it has a chance of succeeding. But since 1991 the government has announced that it will sell ANL. In that time it was absolutely not disputed that ANL had a net worth of at least $100 million.

Although this government has announced, for four or five years successively, that ANL will be sold, there has been massive opposition in the government ranks.

The bill has been so flawed that he has had to come into the parliament on many occasions to try to fix it up. This minister has indicated his incompetence, and his comments of August 1994 when he effectively reduced the value of ANL to $19.5 million indicate he is responsible for reducing the amount of money that the government will receive from the sale of ANL to P&amp;O, if indeed that particular sale goes ahead.

During my contribution to the ANL Sale Bill yesterday, I made it clear that I did not support and would not endorse the sale of ANL, and this morning I voted for the government's legislation. Let me make it perfectly clear that I did that because I accept the discipline of the caucus, I accept the nature of collective decisions which are made by political parties, and I believe it perfectly appropriate and absolutely necessary to our system of government for there to be discipline within parties, governments and opposition—and between them—and that that discipline, integrity, honesty and loyalty be maintained.

         I want to make mention of an observation that was made by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) during his five-minute contribution at the consideration in detail stage. He made the claim that an off-the-cuff comment by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was responsible for what he claimed was a reduction in the market value of ANL, from a net worth of $100 million to its present sale price of something marginally in excess of $19 million. I do not believe in the member's more dispassionate moments that he would make that claim. It is a clever statement, but it is not a credible statement. To suggest that the private sector, to which the honourable member would aver some degree of allegiance, and the value assessors within the private sector are so stupid as to write down the value of ANL from something like $100 million to $19 million simply because of a simple off-the-cuff comment by the Minister for Transport seriously offends the competence and the judgment of people who are required to make such valuations.

         I have emphasised previously that a whole series of quite clear problems and disadvantages will accompany the sale of ANL. What I want to emphasise in connection with that general issue is that, unless certain conditions are satisfied by the end of October, the sale will not proceed. It will remain as ANL and will undergo the option of restructuring. In my mind the prospect remains very strong indeed that, as a result of those provisions, there will be an opportunity for Australia to retain its own shipping line, for Australia to expand significantly the freight in and out of Australia which is carried by Australian flag vessels. We will not become a captive of foreign shipping lines, including the ships of shame, as a result of that or as a result of taking into consideration those international shipping conferences which bear so heavily on the important elements that influence Australia's trading capacity as one of the major commercial trading nations of the world and, unfortunately, one of the very minor maritime nations of the world.

         We have had a maritime presence in Australia for 200 years, for the whole period of European settlement. It could well be that, as a result of these changes now, maritime involvement by Australia may become negligible. I hope not. For as long as we can see into the future, Australia will continue to be a major international commercial trading nation, and we need to be able to back that up with infrastructure that we own and control to ensure that the benefits to Australia are maximised. I believe that ANL can and should become a fundamental element in that whole process.

         As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) has said, if you people were promising anything I would have looked at it, but what are you promising for ANL? You want to flog off ANL, the same as the government does. What are you going to do for the Maritime Union of Australia? Each of you who stood there yesterday bagged it unmercifully. Look at the Maritime Union of Australia. No union in Australia has undergone more restructuring. Look at the shipping levels, the crewing on shipping. It has gone from 40 down to 18. Did you know that? Have you ever made a speech about that? Have you ever congratulated the Maritime Union of Australia for its multiskilling, for its training? That is one of the reasons I have opposed this. I want a well trained shipping movement around Australia. I want seafarers working those ships to be multiskilled, well trained and well paid. I make no apology for it. I do not want seafarers from all corners of the world to be paid the starvation wages that they are paid.

         The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and I have gone to Port Kembla to talk to the seamen there. We have been on those ships. I went to Gladstone to see a ship. There are seafarers there who have not been paid for four and six months. Once in Port Kembla people were fed watermelon for a week. That was their feed. People are being physically and sexually abused. Is that what you want on the Australian coastline?—because by voting to nationalise ANL that is what you are going to get. That is why I am so opposed to what my party is doing. But you people will have to offer a hell of a lot more and give real commitments about the ANL and the Maritime Union of Australia before I make that long, tortuous journey across the green carpet. It will be a long time before you see me do that. You will have to promise more.

The member for Wills (Mr Cleary) gave us an interesting dissertation. But the member for Throsby just made and remade the point. Here is a man who has a passionate point of view, but—we see it again and again in the Labor Party—there is no freedom for the individual to speak his mind and to act in accordance with his words. The motion before the House was simple: would we give the bill a second reading? The member for Throsby put out a press release. This press release was offered around with great gusto. The only person who pulls things out of letter boxes is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He told us about doing that the other day. He used to electioneer putting Labor Party material in and pulling Liberal Party out. That is against the law, but then things like that do not seem to worry the Prime Minister.

That compares with the $15 million appropriation for purposes which are not specified in the bill and which will never be accounted for in this parliament. Certainly if the purchase goes ahead, P&amp;O will take on responsibility for $140 million worth of debt. The remainder of the debt will remain in RetainCo.

         His behaviour through this entire privatisation process has been a shambles. Indeed, as I said before, the manner in which he handled the Howard Smith matter and the change of the articles and the manner in which he took away the authority of the board to act in accordance with his duties is something that the Australian Securities Commission has to be concerned about. It is not sufficient that we see once again the government being able to get away with breaking the law. We saw it when the Prime Minister failed to put in his tax return. He got a little letter saying, `Please would you mind awfully popping it in,' whereas 10,000 ordinary Australians were prosecuted for the same offence.

It is important to set the record straight on a couple of the points that were made both in the debate and in the press release the shadow minister issued.

        The first is in relation to the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose additional payments on the Commonwealth (all relevant financiers have indicated their consents in principle to the change of ownership). The second element is to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to settlement of the sale agreement are significantly worse than current forecasts. The third is to cover any expenses related to the movement of the transferring items out of ANL.

         The appropriations will not be used for other purposes and certainly not for the sorts of purposes that the shadow minister speculated on.

Regarding the unspecified appropriation in relation to RetainCo, the government has undertaken to move an amendment in the Senate to cap the appropriation at $1 million. This should meet the concerns that have been expressed in that regard.

         The government has outlined in the sale bill a clear process as to its intentions for that sale and the alternatives if those agreements cannot be put in place by the dates that were identified and if the restructuring process that needs to be contemplated as part of that alternative cannot be completed. There is absolutely no value in the opposition's adopting this sort of tactic of seeking to derail. The government has made its intentions clear. The sorts of scares that have been run and the sorts of lines that have been run have no basis in fact and I believe that, rather than this sort of tactic of using time unnecessarily, the bill should be supported.

         —We have just had a contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), which gets to the nitty-gritty and makes exactly the points that I raised yesterday in my speech during the second reading debate. The parliamentary secretary has said that the $15 million is to be used for contingency liabilities—that is, firstly, to be used for non-specific, more specified, contingencies that may arise from the sale; secondly, that the results of ANL are worse than anticipated; and, thirdly, to facilitate the transfer costs, including legal fees. Fifteen million dollars is a lot of money to be put aside for such vague purposes.

         The fact of the matter is that the ANL Sale Bill is structured in such a way that it is possible for a major stake, which is still a minority shareholding, to be transferred to someone other than ANL prior to the declaration of sale day by the minister concerned. The legislation says at clause 67(1)(a):

         That $15 million does not belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers. Here is government putting in place a piece of legislation that gives them carte blanche to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money in any way they see fit. If they were to make a transfer by way of a premium payment in accordance with a sale agreement term to the Maritime Union, then you would never know about it. That money would be virtually a secret commission and we would never know. If they chose to make a payment for another reason that was simply made a term of the sale agreement, we would never know. In other words, accountability is just not there.

         It is part of our responsibility as members of parliament to ensure that there is accountability when we appropriate money. In this particular piece of legislation there is none. When I wrote to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) asking for the delay of this debate because we wanted more time to look for information, he wrote to me and said, as the parliamentary secretary has said, that with regard to the unspecified, second appropriation there will be a cap of $1 million placed on that. But it is the $15 million appropriation that concerns me most.

        I do not require a briefing. I require an undertaking from the government as to the manner in which the money is to be spent.

The word of the government has been broken again and again.

         For the parliamentary secretary to stand and say that we will not use it for other purposes, implying that it will be applied only to the precise sale of all shares to P&amp;O—which the legislation does not provide for—simply is not good enough. We need evidence and we are entitled to see the terms of that sale. By all means remove the commercial-in-confidence material, but we are entitled to see what those provisions are. We are entitled to have an undertaking that the government will advise the parliament if there is a transfer of shares to anybody else but P&amp;O or a government entity. I would be interested to hear a response on that.

         The bottom line is that, as legislators, we have a responsibility. It is not good enough to allow a piece of legislation to go through the parliament where the minister has to account only to himself for the expenditure of $15 million of taxpayers' money. We will pursue this matter in the Senate, as we have said. There is already one inquiry under way; there will be another. But the bottom line is accountability.

         —The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said that I did not want a briefing. I had a briefing previously from the task force. It included a person in attendance from the minister's office. We went through these matters, which did not satisfy the queries. I raised these matters in my speech at the second reading stage. I raised them in my letter to the minister asking for a deferral and I specifically asked for undertakings because a briefing does not satisfy the requirement that we who legislate have an obligation to ensure there is transparency in the expenditure of public money. The member for Charlton and I both, as former members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, would be very much aware of that. I say to the member, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there were times in that Public Accounts Committee when both sides of the parliament—Liberal and Labor—would come together because there was a matter that went to the very heart of the integrity of the parliamentary process.

         The point here is that those vague purposes that the government has laid out for the $15 million simply will not wash. If you talk to all the players and would-be players in this game, there are no satisfactory answers as to why that $15 million is necessary. The most serious aspect is that, because of the way the current legislation is structured, members of parliament and the public will not know how that money has been dealt with. That is just unacceptable in a piece of legislation before this House.

         When we voted against this legislation—as I gave notice to the minister that we would—it was because these matters were outstanding and there was not enough time for information to be canvassed so that there can be transparency and accountability in this whole process. In coming to that conclusion, we had to look at the track record of the government in this matter: the behaviour of the minister and the general credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other ministers in undertakings that they had given previously in this and other places and that were then reversed. Dare I say that the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation are all examples of where undertakings have been given by the government that these entities would never be privatised. In the very prospectus for the Commonwealth Bank we had an undertaking from the Treasurer of the day that there would be no further sale of the Commonwealth Bank: that the 50.4 per cent would remain in public ownership. Members of the caucus were told about it just before the sale was announced in the budget in May. Members of cabinet were only told at 6.30 p.m. before the announcement was made.

         In other words, when I say that I want some guidelines and I want evidence of the way in which that money is expended, I do so because I cannot rely on the word of the government and I cannot rely on the word of the minister and, very simply, nor can the people of Australia. This is a matter that goes to the very heart of the job of the legislature. The member for Charlton's responsibility in this matter is just as great as mine because we are here first and foremost, under the constitution, to pass laws for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. That is our task. In reality, if this sale goes through it depends upon the concurrence of the trade unions involved. If the trade unions do not agree, the sale will not go forward.

         —And rightly so, says the member for Throsby. But he is quite happy for it to be, perhaps, secretly dealt with. He does not want transparency. He spoke passionately about the people that he wants to defend, but he did not have the courage to cross the floor. I come back to this point. There was an agreement for the settlement of a union dispute in September 1994 which provided for the unions to have a consortium to buy all or part of ANL. Part and parcel of the agreement for the sale to P&amp;O depends on the unions' concurrence. Here we have a provision in the legislation which provides for $15 million to be dealt with at the discretion of the minister with no accountability after the event. Therefore I reiterate that I want the undertakings.

         The granting of `exempt bed status' under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting `exempt bed status' is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available. However, the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of `exempt bed status' for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing and personal care.

         The bill provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods, which have been identified in its first four years of operation. A mechanism to address shortages, or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations, has been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation. Also included in the bill are changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the `penalty units' classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality safety and efficacy from the market.

         A definition for `food' has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of `therapeutic goods' which excludes `food' but fails to define the term. What constitutes `food' in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words `prescribed dose' and `frequency of administration' included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.

         —I rise this morning to respond to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to the human services and health and therapeutic goods bills. As second reading speeches go, it went. And it went rather more quickly than the second reading speech for mark I of these bills when debated in the Main Committee on 31 May. Then a pair of relatively minor bills were dignified by a second reading speech that the parliamentary secretary—a man not known for his use of superfluous words—held forth for no less than his allotted time plus a 10-minute extension. I understand that he has since taken the Department of Human Services and Health to task for this, and rightly so, as the time of the parliament is now so scarce that the government tells us that every spare minute is needed for government business.

         Those who were involved in this debate the first time around may recall that on that occasion the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), told a story that Andrew Peacock told him about Sir Robert Menzies' reaction to his maiden speech. The gist of the story is that Sir Robert told Andrew to cut his speech by half—and it did not matter which half. In regard to this pair of bills, I suggest the government should have applied Sir Robert's wise advice to its own parliamentary program and broken what was really a difficult single omnibus bill into more manageable chunks. Instead, we have a situation where we are back where we were four months ago, while the government sits like a shag on a rock waiting for an electoral tidal wave to engulf it.

         We should not be here talking about these bills, which were already dealt with once before in this place as part of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. But what happened? Basically there was a breakdown in communication, a failure to treat this parliament as anything more than a simple rubber stamp and an ignorance about the procedures and traditions of this House and of the other place. Had Senator Harradine not complained, rightly in my view, about the unfairness of a mass of complex technical amendments in the one bill, there would have been no split in the original bill on the floor of the Senate. Now we find ourselves back here having to take both parts of that original bill from scratch. Had the government taken the present course in the first place and offered us two bills for cognate debate, we would not have had to go through this charade. Let us not hear anything from the government about delays to Labor's legislation in either house of this parliament. They disrupt their program quite well without any assistance from the coalition, the minor parties or the Independents.

         The shadow minister asked me to raise some specific concerns of his about some provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill which relate to the electronic lodgment of supporting information for listing applications for certain kinds of therapeutic goods. Back in June, when this legislation was first making its way through this parliament, we were urged by the government to get on with the job, because the electronic data lodging facility was due to commence on 1 July 1995, nearly three months ago, and the enabling legislation was vital for its operation.

Just why is it that the ELF, to give it its fairytale acronym, has been in operation since 1 July—with nary a hitch, as far as I am aware? The answer is that ways and means were found by way of appropriate delegated legislation. That is not ideal, as we who prefer parliamentary scrutiny of legislative action will attest, but clearly possible.

         The Natural Medicine Defence Movement has generally welcomed the Therapeutic Goods Act and its regulations in providing one uniform national system of control for the quality, efficacy and safety of therapeutic goods. Nevertheless, it is important that such organisations be continually consulted when changes are made to the act which monitors their tools of trade. Since the act commenced, some 25,000 over-the-counter drug products have been listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Included in that list are a substantial number of traditional Chinese medicine products.

         Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the definition of therapeutic goods excludes food—it was not defined. One of the bills introduces a definition of food, the need for which has arisen because of difficulties for both industry and government in determining whether certain products are to be regulated as therapeutic goods or whether they fall outside that regulatory framework.

        That last paragraph, straight from the Therapeutic Goods Authority, seems to tell me that as a result of this new definition of `food', formula dietary foods or supplementary foods such as meal replacement products have now been declared not to be food for the purposes of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and therefore are brought in under the act. Remember: under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 the definition of `therapeutic goods' excludes food but now the TGA tells us that the new definition for food does not include formula dietary foods or supplementary foods. It is a bit confusing. I suspect there is going to be a lot of confusion out there in the marketplace.

         There are numerous products already on the market that could qualify as either a food or a therapeutic good depending on how they are presented and marketed. The argument is made by the TGA that, when presented in capsule or tablet form with dosage regimen and therapeutic claims, these products should be regulated as therapeutic goods. That is where the new definition of food comes in, as manufacturers should now be much more aware of the claims that they make and the form in which the product is manufactured and marketed. Is the whole issue really any clearer than before? I doubt it quite sincerely.

         The legislation also provides for temporary approval for the general supply of drugs that have not been evaluated in Australia. Although there are strict guidelines and criteria governing the temporary approval, some concerns have been expressed with regard to health and safety issues. The whole idea of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 was that all drugs, pharmaceuticals and therapeutic goods should be properly tested and trialled under strict guidelines within Australia before they are made available for general public supply. The major complaint by pharmaceutical companies at the time of the introduction of the therapeutic goods regulations was that Australian requirements were tougher and more stringent than those in a number of other countries in Europe and in the United States. They argued that not only were the requirements more onerous but the format proposed was unique to Australia. In other words, the way in which they were to present their submission for registration was to be in a format that could only be used in Australia—all this despite the fact that many of the companies are multinational and drugs may well have been on the general market in developed countries around the world for some period of time.

        Over the period that the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 has been in place, there have been a number of complaints from manufacturers and importers that the approval process has been  too slow and delays often seemingly prolonged.

         The one vital factor in any new listing process is ensuring the integrity of the system. The Australian public must have confidence in our system of evaluation and feel secure in the knowledge that all possible steps have been taken to maintain public health and safety. Although the new procedure provides for the applicant to certify, among other things, that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they will be used and that the drugs do not contain goods that are prohibited imports, some concern has been expressed that the certification may not go far enough. I understand that Senator Harradine has expressed his reservations that we may well be fast-tracking drug evaluations without adequate safety precautions.

         An issue which also pertains to therapeutic goods is that of practitioners operating in the wider field of alternative therapies. As alternative therapies become more widely accepted, it is important that the community have confidence in Australian qualifications and accreditation. I note that RMIT in Melbourne has recently introduced an accredited course in traditional Chinese medicine covering such disciplines as acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. That course came about as a result of the expressed demand for Australian qualifications in a discipline that is widely practised by people who have only been trained overseas. I participated in the process of trying to convince the vice-chancellor that this was a proper course of action. I am delighted that the course is up and running. I have great hopes for the future of the course at RMIT.

Over the past few years, I have had extensive discussions with a range of organisations involved in the training and certification of those who would learn to be practitioners in the field of alternative therapies.

The amendments are not quite as tight as the existing act, which could also do with some clarification. The existing act is more specific about search and seizure, with or without a warrant, being related to therapeutic goods. I am somewhat concerned that officers could go off on a `fishing expedition' and take whatever documents or other things that might—and I emphasise `might'—or, then again, might not be able to be used in developing a case for prosecution.

Will this extension make the bureaucrats any more efficient or are we, by extending the time period, offering them more chance to be less diligent?

Most importantly, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) proposes to repeal the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and other acts and encompasses relevant amendments to other legislation and is designed to again extend what we in the government continue to do—that is, look at the amendments that need to be introduced and streamline efficiency. I think the health debate should be about efficiency and not necessarily about putting more money into the system all the time.

         Since coming to office our Labor government has now channelled significant resources and energy into improving the lot of ordinary, everyday Australians in all spheres but, in particular, in health. Since the 1983 introduction of Medicare, all sections of the community have had access to medical and hospital services and pharmaceuticals at an affordable cost. That is the bottom line.

When our opponents say that our health care system is in disarray, what do they actually mean? Do they mean that people are missing out on vital medical treatment?

         Australia's medical system compares very favourably with that of other countries. Since the mid-1980s, whilst most of the OECD countries have shown a levelling in health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, Australia's expenditure has increased. That our spending is more than sufficient has been backed up not just by government but by various quarters.

During the 1993 election campaign, and we are all aware of that campaign, in weighing up the major parties' policies—they were the days when the opposition had policies—the congress concluded that Australia's spending of around 8.1 per cent of GDP on health is about right. As well, that forum overwhelmingly maintained that increased efficiency is more important than increased funding.

I acknowledge that it is a bit old hat to speak these days about the coalition's lack of policy.

         I would like to place a couple of examples on the record. Earlier this year, the new shadow health minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), said that Medicare will stay. But then the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made it clear on 1 February that he was considering dismantling universal access. Meanwhile, the incoming member for Bradfield—a doctor himself—was spending considerable time in Canberra campaigning for a two-tier Medicare levy and the abolition of bulk-billing. I understand that the future member for Bradfield is a longstanding opponent of bulk-billing and he campaigned on that even during his preselection. My question to the Liberals and through them to the coalition is: does the coalition have the abolition of bulk-billing on its agenda? Just what is the opposition's position, given the contrary statements by the future member for Bradfield?

Simply, they will make it easier for proprietors to see how the level of Commonwealth benefit has been calculated.

Over 88 per cent of respondents said that they are `mostly positive about the future'; 90 per cent judged their health to be good, very good, or excellent, and many anticipated new and exciting possibilities.

How was the government going to pay for it? `We are going to pay for it by attacking all this fraud and over-servicing, and we are going to buy public beds in private hospitals.' How much of that $100 million promised at the last election was spent? I think the government has spent about $500,000 of it at John Flynn Hospital in Queensland. The plan was an absolute flop.

         —Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I hope you do not have to warn the parliamentary secretary again. I will tell you why the system is bogged down. It is very simple. The Department of Human Services and Health reckons, on its own estimates, that the people who dropped out of private health insurance between 1 July 1993 and 30 September 1994 will use 322,000 public hospital bed days this year.

         Now 322,000 public hospital bed days is about two quite large city public hospitals crammed full 365 days a year. So just those people who drop their private health insurance in a 15-month period are going to cram two big city hospitals full to the brim 365 days a year. You just cannot build an extra two public hospitals a year to cope with that. You have, therefore, a far greater number of people seeking to use a limited resource. The reason the public hospitals in Australia are bogged down, as your own department identified, is the drop-out from private health insurance.

         Second, if you wish to ask any state leader of any political persuasion what the drop-out of private insurance is doing to the bottom line for their public hospital budgets, you would find that it is wreaking havoc. We are losing over two per cent of the Australian population every year from private health insurance and you cannot compensate for it, so the system gets bogged down and comes under strain.

         By and large, one thing I do agree with the parliamentary secretary on is Medicare is a pretty good system and it provides a good number of benefits that the Australian public like. But let's not be dewy-eyed about it like the Labor caucus. The Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health, Dr Duckett, in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Health Review
         </emphasis>
         actually identified two failings of Medicare. The first was cost shifting between governments and the second was that Medicare is a poor setter of priorities. These are very important points.

         I was having a discussion with a gynaecological oncologist some weeks ago, a person who treats gynaecological cancers. He said to me—it was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—`Already today I have prescribed taxol illegally three times for public patients that I have contrived to be private patients, because if I don't do that they will not get the drugs they need for their cancer.' So one doctor in one morning had shifted $10,000 of costs from a state government onto the federal government. This is happening right across Australia and you do not have a clue how to address it.

         The second area where this is happening is in imaging. We hear the Labor Party get stuck into diagnostic imaging for the great and rapid increase in its use—11 per cent compound a year—and if you took them at face value, you would actually be worried about it. But there is a very interesting thing with diagnostic imaging: we do not make any of the photographic plate to do the X-rays or the images in Australia; it is all imported. So, we know exactly how much photographic plate is coming into Australia. The fact is that in recent years the amount of photographic plate coming in has increased in parallel with the rise in population, yet the cost to the federal government is going up at 11 per cent per year.

         Rather than get stuck into the radiology profession, you would be better to look at the cost shifting that your system encourages and that you have consistently failed to do anything about for a decade. Because the only explanation for those figures I have given is that the total amount of photographs being done in diagnostic imaging is pretty much the same. The 11 per cent increase comes because the federal government is paying for a lot more of them.

         The second thing that Dr Duckett described as a `failure' of Medicare was that it is poor at setting priorities. We see this particularly in the area of preventative health. It was interesting that the parliamentary secretary finished her speech by extolling the virtues of what the government had done, or was doing, in preventative health. If there was something even vaguely genuine about what she said I would back her, but there is nothing genuine here. It is overblown rhetoric.

         Medicare is poor at setting priorities. Our conflict is simply this: on one hand we have government departments and government ministers encouraging people to go out there, to get screened, to get tests done, to have a whole stack of things done, but, on the other hand, the same government ministers get upset when that generates new work, pushes up the country's pathology and radiological imaging bills, and—quite unfairly—the pathologists and the radiologists cop the flak for it.

         The fact is that preventative health is an area of gross negligence. There is no better example than the immunisation of Australia's kids. Under Labor, 53 per cent of Australian children are fully immunised—26th worst out of 28 in the Western world. Try to explain that away! Vietnam can manage to have 97 per cent of its kids being immunised under a voluntary system.

But there is a problem with that: the $18 million is for only two years. If it is such a great scheme, why run it for only two years? The second problem is this: if we actually know that every second kid on the street is not fully immunised, we do not need a detailed register to tell us. There is no better example of the negligence and culpability of a government than its failure to immunise its kids.

The fact is, when you look at whooping cough, measles and rubella, the incidence in Australia has gone up 17 times in just the last five years. That is how quickly it can change if you drop the ball.

         The trouble is that some people in this place, like me, have long memories. I remember the Better Health Commission; I remember when it was set up in 1985; I remember the lofty, overblown rhetoric. Actually, I recently tracked down someone from the Better Health Commission and I asked them to tell me about it. The reply was very illustrative. They said, `On reflection, I think we were all conned; I think we were there to give the appearance of doing something while not actually doing anything at all'. The Better Health Commission reported in 1986; in 1988, goals and targets were published; they were republished in 1992 and republished in 1993. There were 400 goals and targets—basically, `If you've got a problem or you are an interest group, we have a goal and a target for you'. But, at some stage, you actually have to look at outcomes. At some stage you have to go beyond rhetoric. At some stage you have to judge a government not by what they say but by what they achieve.

He said, `One'. The only goal and target we will achieve by the year 2000, according to Professor Baume, is in connection with childhood mortality, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything the federal government has done.

Perhaps some of the government members would care to talk about what happened to that plan. This is an important area of preventative health. It took us 72 years, from the discovery of insulin in 1921 to 1993, to prove that good diabetic control leads to a reduction in symptoms. Those symptoms are nasty and include loss of limb, loss of eyesight, heart disease and kidney failure. We can prevent those symptoms. We could prevent them if the government had implemented what it promised it was going to do in 1988. We could have saved the country a lot of money, and we could have dramatically changed the life of those people and their families who had diabetes.

         Another area of preventative medicine is that of folic acid supplementation. It is beyond controversy that, if women planning a pregnancy—and 60 per cent of pregnancies are planned—supplemented their diet with folic acid at the time of conception, it would cut the rate of spina bifida by half. One in 1,000 kids in Australia is born with spina bifida. Imagine what we could do if we could reduce that by half. Imagine the economic savings and the social savings. What percentage of Australian women know that? What percentage of Australian women planning a pregnancy supplement their diet with folic acid? My guess is less than five per cent. We have a lot of work to do here. We can do it cooperatively or we can keep doing it the way it has been done until now, with falsehoods and misrepresentations. Let us have no more of that humbug.

         I want to touch on a couple of points that were made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He talked about crammed hospitals and how we have neglected people who do not have private cover. What he did not point out is that there are new advantages for people who take up private health insurance. After about 15 years of not having any private health insurance, I am thinking about again taking it up myself. Before anyone says that someone like me should be able to take up private health insurance because I can afford to, I hasten to point out that our incomes determine what Medicare payments are taken out of our salaries. So it is according to income that one makes payments into Medicare, and that is a very fair system. Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pays more than twice as much as you or me and perhaps we pay twice as much as people on very low incomes. That is fair.

         However, there is now an enticement for people to take up private health insurance. There is an arrangement between funds and private hospitals which, I believe, will change the context of what is happening in some of our public wards. People can obtain 100 per cent cover, and that is genuine cover. It does not mean that people are being told they can get 100 per cent of a determined fee and then find that the institution or the practitioner puts up the price even higher than the highest determined fee. It means genuine 100 per cent cover is available to people. The costs will all be listed on one bill, and it will be clear and transparent.

We have to recognise that unlike in Vietnam, which it quoted, there are people in Australia who believe it is their right not to have their children immunised. I am not sure whether we should take that into account; I do not propose to debate that at this stage. I would point out to the writer that we operate under different circumstances.

         At the same time, I thoroughly agree with him that there ought to be immunisation of all children. The vaccines used are properly tested. There is no proven danger from most of the vaccines other than to people who are sensitive to them. I fully endorse what he said about the need for more immunisation in Australia but we need to take it in the context that we are operating in in Australia. When we had compulsory X-rays for all Australians, tuberculosis was almost wiped out in our nation. When that compulsory system of regular X-rays was removed, tuberculosis did creep back. We have to draw the line somewhere. That is what we are doing in health.

         The legislation is not particularly controversial but it makes some important points. I would like to emphasise some of them. One is the empowerment of the Health Insurance Commission to engage in providing consulting, management and related services in the exercise of its powers and to perform its functions overseas. Just recently, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which is chaired by our colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), had before it an expert who suggested that we ought to be selling our health and education systems overseas. He said that Medicare is something which could be of value to other countries. The Health Insurance Commission has already undertaken a number of consultancies primarily—but not exclusively—under the auspices of the World Bank. These activities are getting bigger. There is a need for the commission to have explicit provision to cover this sort of activity.

It costs about seven per cent of its gross domestic product, whereas the United States health system, which is not a similarly organised system as it runs on the private system, consumes about 14 per cent of its gross domestic product—double that in the UK. Australia is in between. It has a better scheme than either of those systems. It has a very good scheme. It does not have the problems of the United States, for instance, of drugs sometimes being three times the price they are in Australia, because we have that negotiating between government and firms under our pharmaceutical benefits system. We have a good system and it is worth selling overseas. I applaud the fact that allowance is made for that in the legislation.

         The legislation also makes provision for a number of amendments in relation to nursing homes which are being granted exempt bed status.

That is particularly important. Those required standards include treating people with dignity.

         Recently I was involved with the Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn, Francis Carroll, in the opening of an extension to Currawanna in Bombala. That hostel for the frail aged has an enviable record. Not more than 85 per cent of the pension is charged to any client—pensioner client or non-pensioner client; that 85 per cent is the limit for all of them. That is because of very strong community support. One of the directors, Paddy Lomas, asked me to convey to the minister thanks for the personal care subsidies that go to Currawanna. I am pleased that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the parliamentary secretary are in the House today to hear those thanks from the hostel for the frail aged in Bombala for that personal care subsidy which, they said, along with the tremendous community support they get, enables them to charge one of the lowest rates in New South Wales.

         The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill is a short bill. Included is the placing of listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian register of therapeutic goods to cut product approval time to a matter of weeks without in any way affecting the quality or the safety of medicinal products. It is important that we acknowledge that the old procedure of demanding that westernised style medicine be provided to our patients and only legitimising that style of medicine has now gone.

         One of the pioneers in this region was Dr Henry Pang, who was formerly with the ACT Health Service and who has now moved to provide services in a number of aid agencies around the world. The last I heard of him he was in Africa after serving in the Middle East. He practised medicine which included not just Western medicine but also some of the concepts of Eastern medicine and of alternative medicine. There are practitioners in Australia today who are able to do that on a much wider scale than they were in the past. Our general practitioners are acknowledging the truth that is in alternate medicine procedures. When I say `alternative' I mean alternative to the traditional form of Western medicine.

         It is important that, when that happens, all that we provide in the way of drugs or therapeutic goods should contain what they are stated to contain on the labels. It is important, too, that illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety and efficacy should be removed from the market. So, while we acknowledge the validity of alternative medicine and alternate treatments, we also ought to perform our duty to people and ensure that there is quality and safety within the medicinal products. I am pleased to support both pieces of legislation.

         The reason I mentioned the medical definition of food is to contrast it with the legislation we are debating. Mr Czarniack recently went on trial for selling a product called Well Being Essiac Herbal Mist, which the Therapeutic Goods Administration deemed to be in breach of the Therapeutic Goods Act. The product was made only of food products—that is, food according to the definitions of the medical dictionaries. Certainly in their individual states, the ingredients would probably also fall within the definition used in this legislation.

         At the time I previously spoke about this matter, I pointed out that Mr Czarniack's house was raided by 11 federal police simply for selling a product made only of food products. I sympathised with him then, but, since the recent events at my own office, my sympathy to him and his family is even greater. Mr Czarniack was charged with selling a product which breached the Therapeutic Goods Act. He asserted that his product was simply a food product which was not consumed in the normal ways but was rubbed into the skin and absorbed by the skin.

         According to Mr Czarniack, his product fell within the definition of food. To prove that, he even ate the product. He spooned it into this mouth and swallowed it. He ate the stuff, yet according to this legislation it is not food. Perhaps it was a Clayton's food—the food you have when you are not really having food. Mr Czarniack's cream was full of nutrients which, according to the medical dictionary, are those products that afford nutrition. Nutrition is defined as:

        Mr Czarniack's creams were made only of food products. When mixed together, they formed a cream which was rubbed into the skin. The active ingredient was egg; that is, that is the ingredient that assisted the other ingredients to be absorbed or ingested and taken into the body. All the other ingredients were food as well. The eggs simply allowed the other foods of nutritional value to be ingested through one's skin. For that, Mr Czarniack had his home, pharmacy and his parents' home raided by 11 federal police and he was fined $96,000. It does sound farcical. It would be funny if it were not completely true.

         As I understand it, Mr Czarniack's theory was that certain parts of the skin are lacking in nutrition and are therefore impaired, so to speak. Mr Czarniack thought that the best route to feed nutrients to that area of the body was as close as possible to it. His theory was to feed the nutrients in through the skin. He mixed in together the foods he thought relevant. They were to provide the nutrients. Adding the egg enabled the nutrients to be absorbed or ingested through the skin. Essentially, the skin ingests the food and the body is being fed, just in a completely different way. Nevertheless, it does not stop his creams being defined as food, just as the stuff fed through the nasogastric tubes is still food, no matter how it is ingested.

         Mr Czarniack was charged and fined because it was alleged that his products were therapeutic and breached the TGA. He disputed this, saying it was simply food. Following his case, these amendments came in offering a definition of food under the TGA. It suggests that food means goods for oral consumption which meet certain criteria. The oral consumption requirement alone would exclude Mr Czarniack's goods. While only made of food, they would not be considered food because they are not taken orally but are rubbed into the skin. The reason I am speaking up for Mr Czarniack is that I believe he has been treated very unfairly. While I have no problem with there being a definition of food in the legislation, I question the definition and why a product made completely of foods—and it falls within the definition of foods according to the medical dictionaries—will not be a food by this legislation, even though it can be eaten and swallowed.

         So what if it is used as a cream? It is still food. I understand Mr Czarniack would not register his product with the TGA because it would have exposed the make-up of the product to his competitors, whom I understand reported him to the TGA. But the legislation did not offer him protection from their stealing his idea, the essential qualities of his product—and perhaps that is something which should be considered for future changes to the legislation.

         I understand that the TGA argued Mr Czarniack's products were therapeutic. He argued they were simply a food. Since then, we find this legislation has made it to the House to offer a definition of food, and I guess the story would go that Mr Czarniack could not call his products food because they do not fall within the TGA definition, though they would, I understand, fall within the definitions offered in medical dictionaries.

         Mr Czarniack took the view that his product was not a therapeutic good but simply a food product consumed in an alternative way but which was beneficial to the body, as food is by definition. I concede that claims about the qualities of the product may have constituted it as therapeutic. It is perhaps the fault of the legislation that this gentleman, an innovative and creative man, can be punished so severely for showing some flair and inventiveness. I trust the government will take on board the views of Mr Czarniack. He is, as I say, a creative and innovative man whose initiative should be nurtured and not legislated against. He needs to be approached by the Department of Human Services and Health and have the views of small inventors and pharmacists listened to.

But, at the end of the day, it is still just plain old food. I take it this legislation is now here to stop Mr Czarniack and his innovations, perhaps at the behest of the large multinationals.

         I will conclude by making a few points about which I hope the parliamentary secretary can satisfy my curiosity. The definition in this legislation for food says it must provide hydration. On that point, would ice, because of its application to reduce swelling, inflammation and so on be considered therapeutic and, therefore, cause water authorities, ice vendors and so on to register with the TGA? How about yoghurt? We all know that yoghurt has therapeutic uses, one of them being that women can apply it to their vaginas to treat thrush. Yoghurt is a food but it appears it would not be treated as food by this definition because it must be taken orally.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is the same with vinegar. Vinegar, as we all know, is pretty effective in treating forms of insect and marine bites. It is rubbed onto the skin and not taken orally; so, if vinegar is used therapeutically, it cannot be claimed to be a food. This may be drawing a long bow in comparison to Mr Czarniack's case, but the principle I believe is pretty much the same.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another part of the definition of food is that it must satisfy a hunger. Does that mean bulking agents which have therapeutic claims and which satisfy a hunger will be classed as food even though they have no nutritional value? Why can we have therapeutic goods which satisfy a hunger or thirst but which offer no nutrition?

         Finally, I would like to address a few comments made earlier in the debate by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She was telling us about how great Medicare is. Labor has lied about the Medicare levy, as you would know. They have bumped it up since its introduction, which has only resulted in more people leaving private health insurance. Membership of private health insurance has dropped from 91.5 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent in August this year. That is why we have over 100,000 people waiting for elective surgery.

         What has Labor done about this problem? Not a single thing. I predict that at the next election Labor will tell porky after porky about our health policy. They lied about it at the last election and they will do it again. That is why they do not support truth in political advertising. If Medicare is so great, why are doctors telephoning my office saying that Medicare has not paid them for their bulk billing? One doctor is still waiting for $18,000, which Medicare owes him and which has been overdue for some time. Another doctor is waiting for $11,000. As the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) said in a debate earlier this week, he wanted:

Right now there are tens of millions of dollars in Medicare bills that have not been paid and which have been outstanding for over a month. The minister claims that the Health Insurance Commission wants an 11-day turnaround. In August, after one month, 1 1/2 million bills remain unpaid.

They are experts at rewriting history. I put on the record that last year over 100,000 Australians were waiting in queues for elective surgery—a third of those had been waiting for over six months.

         We just heard the usual nonsense about Medicare. I was intrigued by the member for Stirling's comments about private health insurance membership numbers. He said that the numbers had dropped from 91 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent now. I wonder why that happened. He seems to have forgotten that in 1983 there was no Medicare; there was no national health system. Unless you were a pension or a welfare beneficiary you had to have private health insurance. No wonder 91 per cent of people had private health insurance. Now only 35 per cent of people have private health insurance. I will come to that point in a minute. The private health insurance reforms of this government are in the news again today.

         I always enjoy speaking in support of government legislation, particularly bills that have been introduced by this minister at the table, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), because we have made a lot of worthwhile reforms to the health system. Medicare is a fine system. It is the best health insurance system in the world. It is the envy of other Western countries such as the United States. Some people in the current US administration have certainly expressed interest in how Medicare works. But just because Medicare is a great system does not mean that we cannot continue to improve it.

         was concern about how this government's private health insurance legislation, which is supposed to take effect from next Sunday, 1 October, was in trouble. Apparently, it was in trouble because the AMA is going out and telling its members who are doctors not to sign the contracts, which would sabotage the intent of the private health insurance legislation—even though some doctors have already indicated they will sign the contracts.

         It is interesting to look at the issue of contracts and the coalition's policy—or lack of it—in relation to the industrial relations debate. This week we have had a bit of focus on industrial relations. That is not surprising given the obvious intent of the coalition, if it ever does get elected to government, to take some pretty draconian measures on industrial relations. The `take the contract or take the sack' mentality will come in. It has been foreshadowed at every election since 1983 that, if the coalition were ever elected, we would have these attacks on trade unions.

         Wouldn't it be interesting if we applied that philosophy to the private health insurance legislation? We could say to the doctors, `Well, either take the contract or we don't pay you Medicare benefits any more.' How would that sit? How would the AMA react then? It would be very interesting to consider the attitude of the AMA, which in some senses is a bit of a trade union—although that is stretching the term a bit, I think. With apologies to the rest of the legitimate trade union movement, the AMA does act as a bit of a trade union, a union of doctors. It is a pretty greedy, grubby one at that. Nevertheless, in some senses it does play that role. It is now urging its members not to sign the contracts under the private health insurance legislation.

         I refer to a speech that I made in this House on 27 March in which I drew the attention of the House to comments by the new Liberal candidate for the seat of Bradfield, Dr Brendan Nelson. He was quoted in the

        That is Dr Brendan Nelson's position on industrial relations. Of course, he is the former President of the Australian Medical Association. I ask the question again: wouldn't it be interesting if we applied the same sort of industrial relations philosophy of the Liberal Party—that is, take the contract or take the sack—to health policy? Perhaps we could tell the doctors that if they do not do it our way we will stop paying them medicare benefits. I do not think that would go down too well—why should we accept it in industrial relations?—especially after the great lengths that this government has gone to in the area of private health insurance to deal with the issue of falling numbers in health insurance.

         Quite frankly, if it were up to me I would let the numbers drop altogether. I am a great believer in the public health system. I know that private health insurance has its purposes and, in the area of ancillary benefits as opposed to hospital benefits, I am still a member of a private health insurance fund—Medibank Private.

But what does the AMA want to do? It wants to sabotage it. It wants to coax its members not to sign contracts, obviously in the hope that it will fall over.

         —I commend members for their contributions to the health bills. I want to respond to a couple of matters that were raised. It is interesting that the opposition raised the question of the behaviour of the Senate in forcing us to actually split this bill into two and to come back with two different bills. We were accused by the opposition of wasting the time of the parliament. What an extraordinary claim. It was the Senate's behaviour in the first instance which forced all of these changes.

         You might have understood that if there were some matter of enormous moment, if there were some issue that they wanted to bring out which they wanted to deal with in some dramatic way, but we have had no amendments moved to the legislation, with no indication from the opposition parties that there is anything particularly that they want to go on about. So one wonders what the whole point of that exercise was in requiring the two bills to be separated. But then to say that we were wasting parliamentary time is an absurdity. The reality is that it was they and other parties in the Senate that forced this division of the bill into two. We are happy to re-present it in that form to accommodate people, but it is a bit rich to then come in here and say we were wasting parliamentary time. It is they that have done this in this matter.

         Precisely because there are not really that many controversial issues in this legislation, even though it deals with a whole range of programs in health and some in human services, we have had a very wide ranging debate and discussion. What has essentially happened is that, because people did not have much to say about the bill and the legislation, they have turned—especially the opposition members—to having a go at the government in relation to our policies, particularly the health policy.

         There has been very little that has been raised on the bill itself. There were some matters concerning the administration of therapeutic goods, but the government is putting into place through this bill a number of amendments to further streamline that administration to make that administration easier and, more importantly, to overcome problems where there has been criminal or quasi-criminal activity in relation to therapeutic goods. The House has not opposed that. So the overall thrust is that the bill's general provisions obviously are being supported.

         That leads me to discuss some of the matters raised by honourable members. I suppose the opposition's general gripe, because they had very little to say about the bill itself, was an attack on the government and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) on general health policies. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), hardly said anything about the bill but actually proceeded along those lines. It is not possible to reply to everything that he said, and I am sure the minister will in due course deal with some of the issues which he has raised. They are not directly relevant to this particular legislation. But simply coming into this House and uttering certain generalisations is not effective criticism. It is not criticism that anyone is going to take seriously. If the shadow minister has any concrete concerns, he should raise those concrete concerns by reference to facts, and not simply after discussions with some of his Liberal colleagues, especially Liberal health ministers in the states.

         In relation to the two relevant issues that he raised, as I said, the minister has already put into place a number of very important programs. I am referring here to hospital waiting times and the issues surrounding private health insurance. It is a bit rich to have the shadow minister trying to lecture us about things like hospital waiting times when we have a situation where several of the state governments that are controlled by conservatives, controlled by their forces, are actually dramatically cutting back expenditure and cutting back the provision of services in health, especially in relation to public hospitals.

         The shadow minister also raised the issue of immunisation. He claimed that the immunisation program was not succeeding and that we were not doing enough.

Notwithstanding that briefing, he came into the House and tried to make some kind of political capital on the issue of immunisation.

That is nonsense. It is a very important initiative which will be followed through to ensure that those groups of children that have been discovered as having missed out will be immunised.

I do not know where he gets that idea from, but this government is in the business of meeting its targets. We are always being criticised by the opposition, which claims that we will not meet our targets. For example, we were criticised at the time of the last election when we promised 500,000 additional jobs. The opposition claimed that we would not meet that target.

        This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988—the act—to implement budget decisions to increase student places and research funding. The costs of these initiatives will be offset by the reallocation of existing discretionary funds, reduction of pipeline places for Victoria, and refinements to the higher education contribution scheme, HECS.

         The 1995-96 federal budget decisions reflected in this bill demonstrate clearly that the government is maintaining its commitment to the development of a high quality and accessible higher education system. They also confirm the government's ongoing policy of no up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. They strengthen the government's commitment to HECS as the mechanism whereby Australian undergraduate students make an equitable contribution to the costs of their education. The changes in HECS build on the essential features of the scheme and bring forward revenue which will assist growth of the higher education sector without increasing the size of any student's HECS debt or reducing the thresholds at which repayments must commence.

         The amendments provide funding for 5,850 new higher education places, plus pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998. These places will go to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will be the major beneficiary of these new places; New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia will also receive some places. The higher education budget package provides for funding of growth in other states in 1999.

         The Victorian government has previously expressed fears that as many as 10,000 higher education places would be redistributed from Victoria to other states to address growing differences in higher education participation rates and population growth. The provision of extra places to Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia has, however, been achieved without any reduction in the existing funding level or number of places at any university. There will be a minor reallocation of some of the growth anticipated in Victoria but Victorian institutions will still experience small increases in both funds and places and participation and access rates in Victoria will remain significantly higher than in other states until at least 2003.

         Amendments to the act also increase the total funds available for research infrastructure to about $293 million over the 1996-1998 triennium. This represents an additional $109 million for research infrastructure. This reflects the government's consistent view that an adequate research infrastructure is crucial for universities to maintain their research and research training capacity at internationally competitive levels.

         All of the initiatives outlined are achieved without any net additional expenditure and without introducing up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. A vital element in this package is a set of refinements to HECS which bring forward revenue but do not increase the size of an individual's HECS debt. It is only by making these changes that the government is able to deliver substantial improvements in the higher education sector without recourse to the easy, but fiscally irresponsible, course of increasing overall government expenditure. One such refinement introduces an extra incentive for early repayment of HECS debts by allowing a 15 per cent discount on voluntary payments of $500 or more.

         Another initiative introduces a voluntary option whereby HECS debtors can elect to repay their debt at a lower threshold and receive a 10 per cent discount. If HECS debtors elect to take up the option, they will make a commitment to repay their accumulated HECS debt at two per cent of assessable income when they are above a specified threshold—$20,000 in 1995-96—but below the first compulsory threshold—$27,674 in 1995-96. Their outstanding HECS debt will then be reduced by 10 per cent. This change will not be mandatory. A person choosing to take up the offer will lodge an election form with the Australian Taxation Office, which will `trigger' the discount and repayments when the person falls within the specified income range.

          The government has created a more flexible, accessible and dynamic higher education system and is committed to introducing policies that make further improvements.

         Consistent with this, the act amends the HECS provisions so that New Zealand citizens, and Australian permanent residents of three years standing or more who have not become Australian citizens, pay their HECS contribution up-front at enrolment. They will also have no further access to the open learning deferred payment scheme—OLDPS. Those students who have had their application for citizenship approved by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may continue to defer their HECS and OLDPS contributions. This will ensure that students who have had a citizenship application approved but who may have to wait some months to attend a citizenship ceremony will not be financially disadvantaged.

         As with other changes to HECS, the revenue brought forward as a result of this change will be used to fund additional higher education student places. The discount on mandatory up-front HECS payments is removed by these amendments. Under HECS, students who pay their contribution up-front at enrolment receive a discount of 25 per cent on their payment. This provides an incentive to pay up-front. This is not appropriate for those students who are precluded from deferring their contribution.

         Another measure relates to the provision of HECS exemption scholarships for teachers. These scholarships were introduced in 1989 to support a greater degree of professional development among teachers. Since that time, the government has introduced a new, more flexible $60 million national professional development program which addresses much of the same objectives.

         As a result of this initiative, and in light of the priority to provide additional undergraduate opportunities, the $4.8 million previously allocated to teacher HECS exemption scholarships will be reallocated to help create student places. In future, Commonwealth support for the professional development of teachers will be provided solely through the national professional development program. As the scholarship program will cease from the end of 1995, there will be no need for a provision in the act exempting scholarship holders from HECS liability, and the act will be amended accordingly.

         Currently under HECS there are three rates of repayment—three per cent, four per cent and five per cent of taxable income—depending on the debtor's level of taxable income. As part of the 1995 budget, the government is introducing four additional repayment rates, of 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and six per cent of HECS repayment income. The 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent rates are intermediate repayment rates and operate in a range between existing threshold levels. The 5.5 per cent and six per cent rates are additional repayment rates being set above the existing maximum threshold level. These additional repayment thresholds will return revenue to the Commonwealth at a faster rate without increasing the size of the HECS debt for individuals.

         An amendment to the act also redefines taxable income for HECS assessment purposes. From 1 July 1996, if a HECS debtor's taxable income has been reduced by a net rental loss—commonly referred to as `negative gearing'—then for HECS assessment purposes the amount of rental loss claimed will be added to the debtor's taxable income. For income earned in income year 1996-1997, and in subsequent income years, HECS assessable income will be used to determine whether or not a HECS debtor is required to make a compulsory repayment against their HECS debt.

         It is a principle underlying HECS that students in publicly funded higher education places should be expected to make a contribution towards the cost of their tuition when, and only when, they have the financial capacity to do so. It is the government's intention that, by instituting this budget measure, those with the financial capacity to repay their HECS debt but who are in a position to minimise their income by claiming rental loss in their individual tax return will no longer be able to avoid making repayments on their HECS contribution.

         In summary, I stress that this bill presents a very tightly integrated package of measures which provides for growth in student places where they are needed, enhances research funds and postgraduate scholarships, does not alter the fundamental elements of HECS nor require reallocation of any existing student places, and does not increase overall government outlays. This package, or `cocktail' as it has become known in the higher education sector, was developed following extensive consultations with the higher education sector.

         As I indicated at the time the budget was handed down, any attempt to unravel this package or to introduce amendments which reduce revenue raising aspects will mean that the government is forced to reconsider its announcement of additional places allocated to Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Alternatively, the government will have to consider the reallocation of existing places from other states.

         Through this package, the government has responded positively and quickly to the resource needs of the higher education sector with both new policy and effective savings without cutting the overall funds available to higher education. This bill underscores this government's commitment to the provision of opportunities for all Australians to have access to higher education; access which is dependent on academic merit and ability, not on the capacity to pay. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the house.

         This visit took place as a result of the upswelling of outrage among Australians at France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. All Australians are appalled at the decision of President Chirac to ignore world opinion and to break the moratorium on testing which was introduced by his predecessor, President Mitterrand. This decision shows complete disregard for the feelings of those living in this region who are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts of the testing over the long term.

         I was quite surprised at some of the misinformation which had crept into the public mind in Europe on this issue. For example, I was asked by one television interviewer in France why it was that the Australian government was funding Greenpeace's activities! It is a curious but unfortunate fact that from the distant vantage point of Europe it is easy to depict the Australian government as responsible for a variety of protest actions, some of which are illegal. In fact, we were in Paris at the time of the riots in Papeete and I am sure that in the eyes of some there was the idea that the Australian government was somehow involved in those protests. Of course the government was not and it does not condone illegal protest activity.

         I am pleased to report that the delegation achieved its principal objectives to a very substantial degree. We had some 37 meetings with government ministers, parliamentary committees, other parliamentarians and relevant figures and bodies such as the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency. We held press conferences and we gave media interviews in each country to pursue our goal of raising public awareness of Australia's position. As well as that, the delegation took part in a video conference from Stockholm with the foreign relations committee of the Finnish parliament. The delegation also attended part of the opening of oral pleadings in New Zealand's action in the International Court of Justice against French testing.

In those countries our discussions focused on the ways in which we could work together to advance our shared objectives. In two other countries—Germany and the United Kingdom—public opinion is running strongly against renewed testing, but for various reasons the response of governments has been disappointingly quiet.

Nevertheless, it was pleasing that, after our visits there, when the first test actually took place, both the German Foreign Minister and the leader of the British opposition issued statements which advanced, very considerably, their public positions on the issue. For that reason, and as a result of the continuing pressure that we are keeping up, I believe the chance of further movement by these countries is considerable.

         The visit to France fell into a category of its own. But even there we were very pleased by the access we were given to senior ministers, including the Minister for Defence, Monsieur Millon, the Minister for Overseas Territories, Monsieur De Peretti, and the Minister for Aid, Monsieur Godfrain. A meeting with the French foreign minister was scheduled but had to be cancelled at the last minute because of an urgent international meeting on Bosnia which Monsieur de Charette had to attend.

         Our discussions were forthright and robust but were held in a calm atmosphere. The French ministers explained the reasons for their government's decision. For our part, we very clearly put Australia's position on the issue to the French. We went through one by one the reasons advanced by the French side, pointing out that their arguments in favour of testing were based on false premises. For example, arguments about reliability of the nuclear weapons might make sense to a mathematician or a defence scientist but, in the real world, no potential aggressor against France would stake its chances on the possibility that French nuclear missiles would not work. Given that 200-odd French tests so far have been successful, the chance that a first weapon used in anger would not go off is not one that an aggressor would be likely to take. And if the first one did not go off, what about the second or the third?

That is a matter I have raised on a number of occasions before, including before President Chirac's election. I regret to say that the French authorities do not seem interested in the idea—for one reason or another, it has not appealed to France.

I would like to pay tribute to the contribution of delegation members from the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats. The fact that all the major political parties in the parliament were represented helped us to reinforce the impact we made by underlining the fact that opposition to nuclear testing is shared across the political spectrum in this country. It was particularly useful, when meeting ministers and MPs from the conservative side of politics, for example in the UK, that they should hear our messages conveyed by people such as Mr Downer or Mr Sinclair who, I note, are present in the chamber. It was useful that they should hear our messages conveyed by people who, on other issues, would normally be expected to be on the same side of the argument as they are.

Another delegation from this parliament, led by the President of the Senate, is currently in Europe on a visit to the European parliament, to Spain and the OECD. This delegation will be raising the same issues we did as part of its agenda. As well as that, we are continuing to make our voice heard in international forums. Australia is actively involved in negotiations on a draft resolution for debate in the United Nations General Assembly. We very much hope that the resolution will gain the widest possible support as it will be an important way of giving expression to the international community's condemnation of nuclear testing.

         I do believe, however, that the storm of opposition which has been aroused over this issue—and of which our delegation was part—has had a measurable impact in France. One has only to look at France's welcome acceptance of a zero yield comprehensive test ban treaty—a concept which has been resolutely promoted by Australia—as well as the statement made by President Chirac recently, which clearly leaves open the possibility that the number of tests by France will be reduced. There are also indications that the duration of the testing period will be shortened. So, overall, I am optimistic that our sustained campaign of public opposition will reinforce this trend, and that we will soon see a definitive end to nuclear testing in this part of the world and, indeed, throughout the world.

         —When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the idea of a delegation to visit European countries and lobby on French nuclear testing—I think it was on what is sometimes known as Hiroshima Day—I was glad to hear the Prime Minister's statement, and was certainly one of the first to publicly welcome it.

         I have taken the view for quite some time that, if anybody is to persuade the French to desist from nuclear testing, it is the European Union. France, when it made the decision to proceed with nuclear testing, had obviously made the calculation that Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific countries would object, and that France could live with that. What the French did not estimate was the strength of protest that would emerge from within Europe itself.

         At the heart of French foreign policy are France's relationships within the European Union and the whole structure of European unity itself. I thought the idea of our going to various European countries, putting our case to them and trying to persuade them to take a strong stand against France resuming nuclear testing was a constructive one. In fact, I said so in a press release that I put out on 23 July, which was some time before the Prime Minister made his statement that such a delegation should go. Bearing all that in mind, the delegation was not only a good idea—given the limited prospects we had of persuading the French to reverse their decision—but also fairly effective.

         As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) pointed out in his statement, there were really three messages that we wanted to get across. The first concerned our opposition to French nuclear testing itself and the fact that all Australians are opposed to France's decision to resume nuclear testing. It is not an issue that has divided the political parties in Australia—parties which are so divided on so many issues—and it was important that people in Europe properly understood that.

         We put our arguments to the Europeans, very much emphasising the non-proliferation arguments. We emphasised the fact that France had signed up to the non-proliferation treaty review conference, on the grounds that it would exercise utmost restraint, and then as soon as the ink was dry on the paper went off—as did the Chinese, for that matter—and resumed nuclear testing.

         Given the enormous difficulties that were involved in persuading many developing countries and many non-aligned countries to sign up to the MPT review and extension conference, and given the difficulties involved and the amount of diplomatic capital that was invested in getting those countries to sign up, it was a matter of some outrage that the French should treat that process with the contempt that they clearly did.

         We argued quite effectively. In Europe there was widespread agreement with the proposition that, at a time when we should be arguing for non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the French and the Chinese, by resuming nuclear testing, were doing nothing but give comfort to the nuclear threshold states. We certainly put the environmental arguments, but the evidence of the environmental damage caused by French nuclear testing is equivocal. There is a shortage of data available from the French themselves. The environmental argument will need to be developed when more data is made available.

         As I have said, these arguments were very well received in just about every country we visited, with the obvious exception of France. In the case of the United Kingdom, I believe that privately the British government sympathises with the arguments that we have put, but they are not prepared to say so publicly. The British are themselves a nuclear weapons state, and they do not feel that it would do much to advance their important relationship with France if they were to criticise the French on this matter.

         —No, they think the British opposition is different because it is Labor. The Australian Labor Party are really profound; there is real depth to them! The second argument that we put was that we wanted a successful conclusion to the comprehensive test ban treaty with a zero threshold. Again, that argument was very well received everywhere we went, including France. The French have said that they will sign up on those terms to the CTBT, once their testing program is complete.

         The United Kingdom was the one country where I wondered whether we would get unequivocal support. When Sir Patrick Mayhew, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland—who, I think, is the fifth in the British cabinet hierarchy—visited Canberra last week, I raised these issues with him, including my disappointment at the stance that the British government has taken on French nuclear testing. I am glad to say that he told me that not only would Britain sign up to the CTBT, but it would definitely do so on the basis of a zero threshold. That was the first confirmation I had heard from a minister, although I believe that the British ambassador to the committee on disarmament had made those points. It was good to see that response from the minister, and in terms of that objective we were very successful.

But, as we pointed out to the Europeans, `The French didn't consult any of you when they made the decision to resume nuclear testing. You, yourselves, are not obliged to support the French on this issue. You are obliged to support your consciences and the principle of non-proliferation.'

         We made several points to the French over and above the simple points about our opposition to nuclear testing. One point we made was that we are not Francophobic: we are not anti-French and Australia is not an anti-French country. After all, as we pointed out—I think it might have been to the foreign affairs committee in the Belgian parliament—something like 30,000 Australians died in the First World War in helping to defend France. To accuse Australians of being somehow Francophobic is an absolute absurdity. We were able to make that point well and truly while we were in France.

If they want the present arrangements to remain in place, that is their decision and their right.

         I believe that, although the French understood the sincerity of those types of remarks made by the minister, made by me and made by other members of the delegation, our position had already been somewhat undermined by the Prime Minister's statement on 9 August when he said, in response to some remarks by President Chirac which, admittedly, were rather inflammatory, `We gave up our colonialism in the 1970s. The French are still hanging on to their colonialism in the Pacific. Maybe the French should have a good look at themselves.'

         Let me finish my remarks about France by saying that our meetings with French ministers—I have said this already—were friendly and constructive, although there were obviously points of disagreement. Those meetings were held on a Thursday and a Friday. On the Sunday we were amazed to hear the vicious attack launched by President Chirac against Australia and Australian motives. President Chirac claimed that Australia provided no aid to the South Pacific at all. At the breakfast meeting with the Minister for Development Cooperation the minister talked about the need for Australia and France to cooperate more in their development assistance programs. How the President could have come out and made that claim, after such a meeting that we had with the Minister for Development Cooperation, I do not know. There is clearly a breakdown in communications in the French government between President Chirac and the rest of his ministry, or between President Chirac's office and the rest of his ministry, and that is something that I would have thought that the French government could closely examine.

         The minister made the point in his speech and in France that one of the things the French should be doing should be looking at sharing data with the United States rather than testing to obtain more data. That was a constructive proposal. I remind the minister that, when we suggested that in an amendment to a motion in the House of Representatives earlier in the year, he said it was a pettifogging suggestion and voted against it, which was a pity; I did not think there was any need to vote against a constructive suggestion. Nevertheless, I was glad to hear the minister take up something that I thought was constructive, which he used to think was pettifogging but which he now thinks is constructive. It is a wonderful thing to see the Labor Party evolve, to follow the lead of the coalition.

I thank Senator Evans and the minister at the table for ensuring that we were able to obtain that information, which has been constructive.

         The minister pointed out some of the gross misconceptions. He pointed out that he was questioned whether Australia was funding Greenpeace.

There was the suggestion that we had banned all French goods in Australia—equally absurd.

         If the minister made one point repeatedly, it was that Australia, since 1988, had welcomed the constructive role of France in the South Pacific, had worked closely with France and looked forward to doing so. However, I am drawn to comment on this issue of the French colonies. As a Labor member, I have to say that the issue of self-determination for the French colonies is one for them and for France. But if any country has reopened that issue, it is not Australia, it is not New Zealand and it is not the South Pacific countries. It is the action of the French President in deciding to recommence tests.

         The French minister gave two responses: one was the compatibility of the weapons; and the second was a national consideration. The second really was that France wants everything about its nuclear deterrent totally French—not one iota non-French. This is an ideological position very difficult to overcome. On the compatibility argument, there are real grounds to move there, although I accept that there are some problems. But I also have to confess to the House that I am not convinced that the French reasons for testing are entirely valid, that is, the obsolescence of some of the weaponry and wanting to maintain its reliability.

         In fact, some of the tests can be categorised as testing new weapons, and not force de suasion or not a deterrent but, as these are for submarines, actually projecting power. Of the attempts by the French to try to cause a distraction from overwhelming opposition was this notion of Europeanising the deterrent. I am pleased to say in the other countries we visited that this concept was rejected out of hand. In fact, for some of the newer members of the EU, it has really placed in question this whole idea of having a European defence. In some ways I think that is a backward movement, but it is seen for what it is, a smokescreen or a device to deflect attention.

When we were in Denmark we were pleased to be able to speak with the ministry for the environment, the minister apologising for not being able to be there. They had quite some confidence in the EU commissioner for the environment who, as you may be aware, is already acting within the EU context to ask France to provide justification for testing.

It was a real delight in Denmark to meet and speak with some young students who had cycled all the way from Denmark to France as a tangible measure of their protest. We were not able to visit all the countries we would otherwise have liked to, and no slights were intended, but to meet some young students from Norway—who were going to spend the whole night and morning getting back to Norway to go to work the following day—was indeed a pleasure.

         —There are not many occasions in the passage of political events in this country of ours where there is a bipartisan approach. More often, fortunately, they occur in the consideration of external affairs rather than domestic affairs. But in this particular instance both external affairs and domestic affairs were linked with the delegation led by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), whom I commend both for the statement that he has made to the House and for his leadership of the mission. His facility with French certainly gave him a capacity to respond on French media to the real audience that we sought to target—the French people.

         It is important that we understand the particular climate within which the decision has been taken by France. It is important to understand the extent to which, with a new president and a new government, there was a feeling by some—certainly by the president and his prime minister—that this decision to resume testing in some way established a counterbalance within Europe which might have been seen to offset the expanded economic strength of an enlarged Germany, the testing being designed to re-establish the supremacy of France within an expanded European Community. In any event, it left a feeling that an agenda was being played out by France that ignored totally the feelings of the French community and certainly the feelings of the rest of the world.

         Early in our visit the minister drew reference to a cartoon that we all might recall which best highlights the circumstances of the distance between metropolitan France and Mururoa Atoll, which is the part of the south-east Pacific where the tests took place. He referred to a cartoon showing a globe of the world and a French general saying to President Chirac, `See, Mon Generale, it will not hurt. You push the button here and it goes bang down here.' He was talking about the other side of the world. It is because France is on the other side of the world and because, without doubt, the decision to resume nuclear testing was related to attitudes and perceptions in France of her role within Europe and of President Chirac's conception of his role within French history that I think the decision to send an all parliamentary delegation was certainly worth while.

         As far as the actual countries we visited and the discussions we held are concerned, much of what has been done has already been catalogued by my colleagues, and I do not intend to repeat their remarks. There are some particular occasions, though, that I think are worthwhile re-emphasising. The first is that, while it is true that in Germany we did not meet a minister, we did meet a senior official within the department of foreign affairs. We did without doubt get the feeling that the public approach to France by Germany—by the German government and the chancellor—was quite different from their private approach. Indeed, we were very pleased to see the German foreign minister coming out, after the first French test, with quite a strong public condemnation of the resumption of testing. We were assured that privately at least, within the forums of the community and the bilateral contact that exists, the Germans had been more forthright than they were prepared to be publicly—even with us.

         Within Germany, as within every other country of Europe, there seemed to be two layers of resistance. The first and the most notable was within the community at large. The community right throughout Europe—in part because of the publicity attracted by our visit and the actions of Greenpeace and others—certainly had concentrated their minds on the consequences of the resumption of French testing. An aspect that each of us stressed was that it was not a matter of Australia condemning France on any issue other than on that one particular focus: resumption of underground testing.

         I believe that by doing that, not only were we able to maintain the momentum of bipartisan representation but we were also able to assist in the momentum of concern in that wider European community. We all recognised that the particular relationship between France and Germany has been quite instrumental in the development and formation of the European Community. It was because of that focal relationship between Germany and France in the community that we saw it was important that we visited more than one country and helped to ensure that the community's views were reflected in the consciousness of the status of the French decision and reflected back on those who took the decision.

         The second part of the visit that also impressed me, which certainly from afar I had not registered, was the changing character of the European Community as a result of its expansion. Three of the countries we visited—or two we visited and one whose foreign affairs committee we spoke to by virtue of a teleconference—have recently joined the European Community. While little has been said, I do not think enough attention has been given to the impact on the decisions and the function of the European Community as a result of its expansion.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          than perhaps previously might have been thought. One of the significant reasons why it is not going to proceed is not that those new countries have joined the European Community but that France has recommenced nuclear testing in the South Pacific.

         I am sure the French did not look towards that consequence during their discussions. Indeed, one of the other aspects of that consequence is, as several members have mentioned, that while France was calling on her European colleagues not to dissent from her status on an issue that she said was within her sovereign responsibility and was not something that was domestically within the concern of other countries, when it was mentioned that the French did not consult with the other members of the European Community prior to recommencing the nuclear test program, they reacted in a way which showed how frustrated they are and that, if there is to be a common European foreign policy, it need not automatically be that of France. That is a concept which the French find a little hard to accept but it is a concept which now is filtering through simply because the French have ignored that very consultative mechanism which they were largely instrumental in writing into the whole of the concept in the first place.

Like others of my colleagues, I was very disappointed in the approach taken by the government of the United Kingdom. It was only in the United Kingdom, in Germany and amongst one group of French liberals in the Belgian committee of foreign affairs that we found any resistance at all to the idea that there should be a united approach to condemn France for the resumption of nuclear testing. As the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) said, David Davis gave a greater justification for the resumption of French testing than even the French themselves. I found that most disappointing.

         We all understand that France has been overrun successfully over the last 100 years. It is not that we do not understand France's strong commitment to either force de frappe or force de suasion, whichever term you like to use. Indeed, as the minister and others have said, we not only understand it; we endorse it. We recognise that the French  feel vulnerable. They do not want again to be overrun by another country. That is not only a natural feeling for France; it is a natural feeling for any country. So the circumstances around their force de frappe and force de suasion were not matters that we canvassed.

         What we canvassed was that there was no need for them to extend their nuclear capability by having a test in the first place. Having exploded the nuclear weapon, there was absolutely no reason for them to proceed in what they said were tests to establish the calibration procedures, which it has been suggested they could very easily attract from the United States. There has been some discussion about that today. Let it be said on record that I, amongst others, have raised this with the Americans. I have been assured that they have made offers to the French, even though the French and the advisers to Charles Millon, the French Minister for Defence, assured us that they had not been offered the necessary advice to allow them to develop their own computer testing processes. They said that, even if they had, `Our weapon is different.'

         I fail to understand how any formula cannot be developed. Certainly when they have already had nearly 200 tests of their own you would think they would have the fundamental information. To my mind, the fact that the Americans were prepared to give them the additional information totally destroys the validity of their calibration requirements in future testing. As for obsolescence, as the minister said in his statement today, if the first weapon does not go off, the probability of the second going off is certainly far greater. They have shown that their first did go off. I certainly am most apprehensive about reports I have read that the whole thing is really about miniaturisation, about developing a new trigger mechanism, and certainly not just about obsolescence and calibration.

It is important that the French, partly as a result of this discussion today and certainly hopefully as a result of the discussions that we had in Europe, should register the strength of our views and our feelings.

         I summarise by saying: where did we get to as a result of our visit? I know others have said it, but I think it is important to reiterate that Chirac's popularity has not declined peculiarly because we visited but because of the consequence of a recognition that nuclear testing is against the mood in the European Community. Our visit was no more than a factor in marshalling and mounting dissuasion within the countries of Europe against the continuation of testing.

I find it quite incredible that, at an age when France is saying that we have an expanded Europe and we are going to be able to play a continued important role in the future, they should take decisions of that character.

         As far as the arguments of Chirac himself are concerned, there is little doubt that he has little communication with his own ministers. As has been said, the discussions with each of his ministers—the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Development Cooperation and the Minister for Overseas Territories—were exactly the reverse of the statements he made on air on television on the Sunday following our visit. One wonders what sort of an agenda he was pursuing for that reason. There is only one focus of our objection: the resumption of nuclear testing and its continuation.

         The third real concern that we all had is where we go from here. CHOGM provides another forum for opposition. The resolution of the South Pacific Forum shows the strength of opinion of the South Pacific countries and New Zealand. One of our purposes was to try to ensure support for a United Nations resolution, which will be hopefully brought up immediately after the commemoration and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. We hope that many countries will join with Australia towards a resolution which will really place a moratorium on further test bans until the comprehensive test ban treaty can be concluded. We hope that resolution will be universally supported.

         Above all, it is essential that the French understand that we hope that they will not only become a party to that comprehensive test ban treaty with a zero threshold—as they have said they will do, and as we hope will Britain and the United States—but also sign the protocols of the Treaty of Rarotonga. We trust that they will desist from further testing and recognise that the product of the decision by the French President has been very much to the detriment of France and not to its benefit.

         Secondly, the other very strong impression I gained is that the French President and some of his chief advisers and strongest supporters are locked into a time warp. They still think we are in the 1970s. They do not understand that the world has moved on and that in the 1990s, in the post-Cold War era, the people of the world do not want nuclear weapons being expanded, developed and tested. They want the world's leaders to be removing, reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons. They do not want more nuclear tests.

         The third very strong impression I gained from our visit is that, thanks to Jacques Chirac, Australia's reputation in  Europe is at an all-time high. The people of Europe recognise that Australia has shown very strong international leadership on this question. They respect us greatly for the effort that we have put in in taking this question straight to the French. They respect the principled basis of our arguments. They understand that we are working on behalf of a lot of people. They respect the role that we have played in assisting those small nations in our region in the South Pacific who, as very small nations, do not have much of a voice themselves. We as a major nation in the South Pacific region have worked on their behalf as well. We have incredibly increased our reputation and support amongst the people of Europe because of the principled stand that we have taken on this issue.

         Nuclear testing has been an issue that has affected us for a long time. The people of Queensland were very angry during the 1970s when the French atmospheric testing was carried out because a lot of the fallout was occurring in North Queensland. So there is very strong opposition in Queensland to French nuclear testing. Although these tests are now underground and do not have the same immediate impact on the environment that the atmospheric tests did, there is still a very strong feeling amongst the people of Queensland of great opposition to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Again, it was a great opportunity for me to be a voice for the people of Queensland in France and in Europe on this question. So I thank the Prime Minister and the parliament for that opportunity.

         I have been on a couple of other parliamentary delegations. This one was quite unique in that we worked totally as a united team. The team consisted of members of the opposition, a Democrat senator and members of the government, but we were one voice. That had an enormous impact throughout Europe. It certainly had an impact on politicians who understand how Australia has a pretty vibrant and vigorous parliamentary system and how it is often very difficult to get two sides to join on an issue. We were there speaking as one voice, and we made a very effective team in doing that. That unity helped us to successfully get our message across.

         Of course, we were not able to end nuclear testing by the French. As much as we all would have liked that to have happened, we knew it was not going to be possible just from our visit, but I do believe we achieved a lot of our other aims. Our first and most important aim was to bring clarity back to the debate, to try to counter some of the arguments that the French media and French government spokespersons had been trying to peddle throughout Europe about other motivations behind Australia's campaign.

         It was very helpful that we were in Europe at the time President Chirac made two speeches about the French nuclear testing issue. Being in Europe, we were then able to talk to the media, the politicians and the people to counter some of the points that President Chirac made. We were very successful in that we very clearly identified our two strong objections—disarmament and the environment. None of the other baggage that President Chirac was trying to attach to us had any relevance or any basis in fact at all. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) and other speakers here today have outlined how we managed to counter those things.

That was not our motive. It is clear that the people of Europe, like the people of Australia, are angry about the French. They are using one of the few vehicles they have to express their view—that is, a consumer boycott of French goods—as a means of expressing their anger at the French government's decision.

         It is not good enough for the French to say they will sign a comprehensive test ban treaty in the future. Deferring difficult issues cannot be tolerated, because those people in our electorates expect us to speak with meaning and act decisively.

Our argument is not with French people, whom other generations of Australians have fought with as allies; our argument is with the French government.

I am not going to say, as we have been accused of saying, that we were there to stir up a feeling for French independence, because that had not entered my head before I got there.

It was the Leader of the Opposition and the members of the Liberal and National parties! Not only did the introduction of that bill bring forth from the government—belatedly after 12 1/2 years—a piece of legislation to entrench into law the existing curfew arrangements at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and to add a few changes at the shoulder to sort of dress it up and tizzy it up and pretend to the Australian public that it was in some way different from the measures that had been put forward by the opposition; above and beyond that it has provided the parliament with an opportunity to debate issues related to the reopening of the east-west runway.

        So there are two considerations. The first is the time difference. In order to get the departure off, if you do it on the east/west runway it takes an additional 20 seconds, if you do it on the north/south runway it takes an additional 50 seconds, if the departing aircraft is on the north/south runway it is sitting on the runway in a collision situation—

        In other words, he is arguing that it is not quicker and it is not safer to maintain the policy of the operation of the airport which is now maintained by the government. He is an admitted environmental and aviation expert, a person who was an adviser to a former minister in the government. So not only do you have people of that ilk but you also have the Regional Airlines Association, the air traffic controllers union, the Australian International Pilots Association and the current minister's predecessor, Senator Collins, who said in the Senate on 13 August 1991:

         —We have seen a dramatic change in all these areas. The challenge is to keep these changes going. Those on the other side of the parliament say that they're the ones to keep it going; that the Labor government has come as far as it can on the labour market; the Labor government has come as far as it can on air traffic; it has come as far as it can on shipping and the waterfront; and—this is your spiel around the boardrooms—it is now time to hand it over to us, the hairy-chested people who will go in and do the final nut cracking. The Leader of the Opposition said on 17 February 1995:

        Reignite it! This is the same person, Mr Speaker, who wants to cut down by 20 to 25 per cent the throughput and efficiency of Mascot airport. Then, on 20 May this year, he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        A coalition government will revitalise the micro-economic reform process.

       </para>
       <para>
        This is the sort of chatter we have about the needs of micro reform on his side of the House. Mr Speaker, he had this to say on 3 September 1991, talking about Sydney airport:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What makes what this government has done so criminally irresponsible in a political sense is that all along it has known the right thing to do. It is one thing to be invincibly ignorant about the correct economic prescription; it is an infinitely more culpable thing to know what the right thing is and to conscientiously eschew that course of action in the name of political expediency and political opportunity.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly and precisely what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. He was upbraiding them—members of the government—he said, who knew what the right thing was to be done and who were then culpable, not through invincible ignorance but because they were doing something which was politically expedient and politically opportune—his own words. Then he said this about the member for Barton:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Anybody who knows anything about the scandal of Sydney airport and the disgraceful political featherbedding of the honourable member for Barton must regard this as one of the most shameful exercises in political cynicism at the expense of the interests of the greatest Australian city this country has seen. The government was going to do all these things. It was going to be the party of great reform. It was going to be here to say this is the end of its third term, and, here we are, we picked up the rest of the reform agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he is upbraiding Mr Punch for what he says is his opportunism—and of course Mr Punch resigned his place in the ministry over this decision and put his integrity on the line—yet he talks about the right thing to do and knowing the difference between invincible ignorance and doing something politically opportune.

        Indeed! For the most crass of political motives, having supported the north-south configuration of the third runway for years and years, now for a handful of votes in the seat of Bennelong he is trying to hold the government to ransom by putting asunder the assets sales program, which will advance the micro reform agenda. In the largest micro change in the airports of this country in 25 years—the opening of this runway and the attendant increase in traffic—he now wants to cut back the movements from roughly 80 to 85 per hour when the new control tower is operational to 55 to 60 per hour only when the cross-wind runway is put back in the system. That, of course, would be a danger and would be inherently unsafe, with an aircraft on the cross-wind direction needing to cross the runway and flight paths of two other intersecting aircraft.

I say to some of these people in the press gallery that if the scales are falling from your eyes it can be for only one reason: you were not here in the 1970s and the 1980s; because, for any one of you who was, he is just like he always was—without ideas and without principles.

        We accept the advice of the regulatory authorities of our own technical experts that safety and efficiency would be diminished by permanently reopening the east-west runway to jet movements. The key point is that intersecting runways are inherently less efficient and less safe.

       <para>
        That is the view of the two airlines. That is the view of the regulatory authority. It is the view of the people who operate the system. But the Leader of the National Party has the gall to put his view in here, trying to juxtapose an argument to say that because there is one directional runway in Melbourne and other ports with a cross-wind heading they have cross-wind runways. If the winds change, what do you want to do? Close the airport down for a day or two? The cross-wind runway will be used in Sydney when the weather changes, as well.

         Since the government deregulated the airline system there has been a 60 per cent upward movement in traffic. If we were to adopt the opposition's policy all the people who come from the provincial cities of New South Wales would need to hub at a certain airport and get into a wider-bodied aircraft. So the people in 10-, 15- or 20-seater planes from Albury, Cowra, Dubbo, Mudgee, Tamworth, Armidale, Griffith, Hay or Wagga will all have to hub somewhere and then climb into a wide-bodied aircraft so it can get access to the Mascot airport. That is why this parallel system is inherently more safe.

         But the government has the other policy in place, and that is to diminish the burden of the noise through two things. One is the most ambitious noise abatement program in the world and the second is the establishment and development of Badgerys Creek airport so that the city has a complementary airport, so that burden is taken from people. But the Leader of the Opposition wants to put the noise back on, as the minister estimates, 86,000 people or, as the mayor of Rockdale estimates, 142,000 extra people as aircraft again use the east-west configuration on a permanent basis.

That is why I say he thinks the public in some way are going to fall for the malarky that he is out there trying to even up the noise. They all know the issues here. They have been in this debate for years. It has been on for 20 years. They all know that, if the east-west runway opens, about 100,000 people are going to get more noise. They know that if a cross-wind heading is used again the place is going to be inherently unsafe. They know that capacity is going to go down.

I take this opportunity to indicate to the House the very serious national implications of any delay in the construction of the new airport at Badgerys Creek; that is, the Sydney West airport that this government is committed to commissioning in time for the year 2000 Olympics. There is no doubt that delay is an absolute certainty unless the Leader of the Opposition backs away from his reckless attempt to vandalise the government's airport leasing strategy.

         The whole financing of Sydney West airport is predicated on the leasing of Sydney's existing airport. Indeed, the two airports are leased together. Ensuring that Sydney West is built and opened by the end of 1999 to a standard and to the timetable set by the government is an absolutely non-negotiable condition of the lease of Sydney airport. We are very busy. I indicate to the House that the environmental impact statement on the first of the major road links to that airport will be released early next week. We are working with the Federal Airports Corporation and the Department of Transport to have that job under way, because it faces an extraordinarily tight time frame.

         The leasing of Sydney airport and the funding of Sydney West are an essential, intrinsic part of an overall package. By broadening that leasing process, the opposition leader is making that timetable impossible. In turn, he is ensuring that Sydney only has one airport in the year 2000 to cater for the great influx of traffic that will bring those hundreds of thousands of tourists to Australia in the year 2000 to attend that great event.

Not only is he sentencing us to one airport; he is saying that, if he is ever unfortunate enough to be elected, it will be one airport with cross-runways operating jet movements. That is what he has committed himself to. The capacity of the airport then falls over.

         Not only would we have no jobs, no airport and enormous congestion and chaos at Kingsford Smith airport; we would also have a flow-on delay at every airport around Australia. One of the truisms of Graeme McMahon in the circular he put out last year to all the frequent fliers at Ansett was that a delay at Sydney airport prangs around the whole system. It has a knock-on or repeater effect. Every time a plane is in a holding pattern or is stuck on the ground at Kingsford Smith, it is late getting to the other end.

         In the environmental impact statement, the additional cost of that was put down at $1 billion. So it is a further $1 billion hit as well. At the same time, he guts the value of the principal asset of the Federal Airports Corporation. It would be very hard to imagine how he would do it while keeping his commitments to fix up the budget surplus. How in God's name would he do it?

         We have waited a long time in this place to see some opposition policies. Now we have at least two: we have a policy on IR and we have a policy on Sydney airport. Both of them have been personally designed by the Leader of the Opposition. If they are anything to go by, at least let us bring on the rest.

In the budget debate this year we have seen the opposition oppose $1.5 billion worth of tax measures. They are also seeking to reduce various spending cuts, such as the better targeting of child-care assistance and changes to the HECS scheme. As we have heard in the last couple of days, they now want to stop the government going ahead with the privatisation of the airports at a cost of something in the order of $2 billion.

You also cut social wage expenditures in the areas of health, education, community services and housing by some 17 1/2 per cent per capita in real terms.

         The only surpluses that have ever been produced by a government of Australia has been under this government in the late 1980s for four years in a row and, of course, we will be restoring it to surplus this year and in the years hereafter. We are the ones with the credentials on budget policy; we are the ones with the credentials in terms of producing good budget outcomes; and we are the ones with the credentials to attack the current account deficit—certainly not the opposition with this set of crazy policies.

The first point to make about Australia TV is that half the members of this chamber and half the members of the Senate have been congratulating the ABC on the great job it has been doing in putting together Australia TV. I am always surprised at how frequently Senator Alston, the opposition spokesman on communications, attends the launches promoting Australia TV both in Australia and overseas. I have heard one or two opposition spokesmen as well advocating that Australia TV has done a good job in raising our profile in Asia.

         I am not going to deny to the member for North Sydney that the ABC has certainly not met its targets in obtaining sponsorship for Australia Television. That is why the government at the moment has a review of the international broadcasting services of the ABC, both Radio Australia and Australia TV. But I would have thought the honourable member for North Sydney would agree with the view, which is widely held I think on both sides of this House, that it has been good for Australia to have Australia TV out there raising Australia's profile. The question, as we conduct the review, is whether this is the best way for the public's finances to be used to promote Australia in the region, or are there alternative options that can be explored. Decisions will be made on Australia TV probably by the end of next month.

         Senator Alston, the opposition spokesman on pay TV, has criticised the government for the fact that the ABC has been involved in pay TV. Yet Senator Alston was the senator who moved the amendment in the Senate that forced the ABC to be involved in pay TV. It is a bit hypocritical of the Liberals to run around saying that it is a terrible thing that the ABC has not been successful in pay TV and the government is responsible when it was a deal between the Liberals and the Australian Democrats that actually forced the ABC to be issued a licence.

         From the government's point of view, we said that we did not want the ABC's involvement in pay TV to have any detrimental effect on the ABC's free to air services. So we gave the ABC $12 1/2 million to try to ensure there was no impact on the excellent content that goes to make up the ABC's free to air services. I know that some people, including Senator Alston, are suggesting that all $12 1/2 million has been spent. My advice is that that is not correct: it is significantly less than that.

         The government has made clear in the House before that such things as overtime, penalty rates and holiday leave loadings may be traded in and cashed out to an employee provided this can only happen on the basis that the employee is made no worse off. In other words, if the employee wants to take some of these benefits as cash, the government's no disadvantage test provides flexibility in the labour market. But we do believe that there are community obligations on areas such as sick leave and other things that should not be cashed out.

         This is not the case with the opposition. The opposition will allow these things to be basically taken away without compensation. I gave some examples the other day. Let me flesh some of them out. I talked about a nurse who was receiving penalty rates and overtime. She now finds they have gone and this would reduce the nurse's income by about 22 per cent or $5,000 a year. A truck driver who works 12 hours overtime a week is offered a new contract by his employer with just the minimum conditions. In that case, even if he works 12 hours more than a usual full-time driver, he finds his annual income is cut by $113 a week or $5,900 a year—a cut of about 18 per cent. That would apply to the 359,000 people in that occupation at the moment.

Unluckily for Mr Allan he worked in Western Australia. The Western Australian government has introduced its version of what the Leader of the Opposition believes is a good industrial relations policy. Mr Allan was eventually sacked for not agreeing to the conditions. No doubt some other person who has agreed to the conditions has taken his place. This is the chipping away.

Is it such that it is going to improve our competitiveness? But we are already 40 per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago. Is it for productivity? You would say, `Well, it must be for productivity.' Yet in New Zealand, the country mentioned in the interjection, in the period since individual contracts were introduced in the legislation labour productivity has risen by one per cent. In the equivalent period in Australia it has risen by 2 1/2 per cent.

         As a consequence, we would see wage inflation reintroduced into Australia.

        That is the view he put in 1993. He has always seen the big change as not the GST—even though he is still hungering for that. He regards the greater change as a change in the labour market policies, as introducing their labour market policies. That is what he sees as the great change. So does the ACTU and so does the work force. That is why a coalition government would be met immediately with a very large wage round which would kick wage inflation along, and straightaway the Reserve Bank would go for the interest rate lever. That is why in a coalition government you will see a dramatic increase in interest rates as the only remedy to try to handle wage inflation.

         —My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House. Earlier this week the Deputy Prime Minister stated that to reopen the east-west runway at Sydney's Mascot airport would increase its capacity by 10 extra jumbo jets per hour. Today, the Prime Minister has stated that to reopen the east-west runway would be a failure of micro-economic reform because it would reduce the capacity of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. Who is correct—the Deputy Prime Minister or the Prime Minister? You can be sure that both of you can't be.

If, however, you operate on the stub of the east-west runway—which you also argue against on safety grounds—that is advocated by the Regional Airlines Association with the positive benefit, they argue, that there would be a massive increase of 10 jumbos per hour on the north-south runway, a most extraordinary thing, the impact of that, of course, would be to massively increase the noise over the people at both ends of the runways and be an unsafe operation.

It is a timely question in the sense that it anticipates by just a few days the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. That agreement has been in place as a framework for a great deal of housing policy throughout the postwar period. It has resulted in the construction of nearly 400,000 houses and the housing of about 500,000 additional people during our time in office.

         In terms of attitudes to housing in Australia, in part some of that research refers to the very high level of satisfaction generally with housing; according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 86 per cent of Australians are satisfied with their housing. In addition, the ABS has recently indicated, according to a comprehensive survey, that home ownership in Australia is at historically very high levels at over 70 per cent. Further, this government has made a major contribution through the first home owners scheme which resulted in housing about 370,000 people.

         There was some reference by the Leader of the Opposition to a report by NCSEM which went to the issue of affordability for housing for low income people. This government's record is that in part we have sought to care for low income people by quite dramatically increasing public housing stock—by about 50 per cent since we have been in office. But we also recognise what was certainly not recognised by the opposition in its time—the fact that a great number of people in the private rental market require housing assistance.

         Back in 1983 the level of housing assistance for low income people was around $5 a week—a miserly amount and an amount quite insignificant in terms of what people were paying by way of rent. In our time in office we have increased the maximum rate of rent assistance for single people by around 90 per cent, for families with one or two children by 105 per cent and families with three or more children by 135 per cent. So not only have we dramatically increased the extent of public housing; we have effectively put alongside public housing a very substantial scheme for assistance in the rental market. I emphasise that because it is an important part of comprehensive housing reform.

         The Commonwealth-state housing agreement was created in the 1940s as part of a vision for postwar reconstruction. It recognised the needs of an immigration that would be one of the great immigrations of the postwar period. It recognised the needs of growing industry and the provision of public housing to go with that industry. It recognised that we needed to develop policies within the context of comprehensive social policy. That is why when the Leader of the Opposition speaks about poverty and inequality we remember that rent assistance under his government was five bucks a week. We remember that under the previous government public housing was not dramatically expanded; it was cut. We remember that under the Liberal and National parties there has been no articulation of policy and no recognition that there needs to be any kind of public debate—no recognition of the need to involve the public in discussing these kinds of fundamental issues. That is why people are inclined to be sceptical about the opposition, in part because its record—I say this to the member for Kooyong who appears to be trying to interject—is not only abysmal but extremely regressive and in its time in government resulted in a decline in real terms in almost every payment in the social security system. That is why we are sceptical. But your failure to articulate any kind of social policy, to engage in any kind of debate, means we can be quite clear that, apart from scoring the odd debating points, your leader and your party—the opposition party—have no commitment to social reform.

These are the policies you have followed. You have always regarded the expenditures we have made, such as those on Working Nation—which was about getting unemployed people back into work—as an extravagance. That was how it was described by one of your frontbenchers, then the Leader of the Opposition. Generally you have put no premium on high employment, which has been the main way in which poverty in Australia has been alleviated. As a consequence, we have now seen over 25 or 26 per cent employment growth. In fact, I think it is nearer to 30 per cent, but I need to check that figure. As a consequence, we now have a work force of over 8 million people—we had 6 million people in 1983—household disposable income has risen by 40 per cent, and household disposable income per capita has risen by 21 per cent.

        In summary, the provision or subsidisation by government of non-cash benefits, such as health, education, housing and community services, has an important impact upon material wellbeing. Excluding them from poverty measures may give a misleading picture of trends over time if the magnitude or type of such non-cash benefit is changing. NATSEM estimate that the addition of the social wage substantially reduces estimates of poverty by nearly 50 per cent overall. For couples with children it is estimated that the social wage reduces poverty from 10.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent, while for sole parents the corresponding reduction is from 22.4 per cent to 4.2 per cent.

         —The member's question relates to the opposition's assertion here in question time yesterday that a bus driver in Sydney earns much less than a bus driver in Seoul in South Korea. We all remember the question and the assertion  from the member for Adelaide. I am now aware of the source of the claim made by the honourable member. It is this document produced by the Union Bank of Switzerland. It is a study called the `Prices and Earnings Around the Globe: 1994 Edition'. I have had a chance to have a bit of a flick through it.

         According to this publication, a Sydney bus driver earned the equivalent of $US16,000 in 1994. That compares, according to this, with the Seoul bus driver who, it asserts, earned $US16,800. Unfortunately, the basis for the opposition's claim is hopelessly inaccurate. The Department of Industrial Relations advised me that the Australian full-time adult bus driver earns a good deal more than $US16,000. In fact, it has given me the ABS report for the year of 1994, which indicates that the Australian full-time adult bus driver actually earned an average income of $US24,583. That just happens to be 46 per cent more than the figure for the Seoul bus driver in the report you quoted from.

         That is not the opposition's only problem, because when you go through the report you find some very interesting things. This report says that in Seoul the old bus driver works a 44-hour week. Guess what the Sydney bus driver works.

         But hold on—that's not it. If you go on in the report you find that the old Seoul bus driver does not get any annual leave at all—none whatsoever, a big zero. He works 52 weeks of the year, whereas his equivalent in Sydney gets four weeks annual leave. As if all this—the annual leave, the hours of work, the 46 per cent—were not enough, the report goes on to highlight the disparity in living standards between Sydney and Seoul. This is your own report. It indicates that the purchasing power of wages in Sydney is twice as high as it is in Seoul. The Sydney bus driver gets 46 per cent more and his wages buy twice as much. Have you got that? It is worth getting.

         It really does make you wonder how much the Liberal Party is paying the driver of the debt bus. If he is being paid according to the opposition's policy he is driving the highway to hell, the low way to hell. The Liberal Party policy would take from that Sydney bus driver or from the debt bus driver, if he is getting the award, his overtime allowance, would take from him his penalties, would take from him his annual leave loading, would take from him his cumulative sick leave, would take from him his award super, would take from him his hours of work provisions. You should look at your reports a little more carefully in the future.

       Are you aware of comments made at the Queensland rural women's conference at Longreach that this government treats rural women as second-class citizens?'

       I thought it was a bit rich because the comments were made by the National Party member for Kennedy, Bob Katter. In terms of treating women like second-class citizens I refer all senators . . . to the House of Representatives
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Hansard

       when Mr Katter quite recently opposed the government's equal opportunity legislation for women. Mr Katter gave as his major reason for opposing the equal opportunity legislation—and I quote from the House of Representatives

       —`A woman's place is in the home.'

      <para>
       My staff could not find the quote. Then we had two separate people from the Library look for it. We got this answer back from the Library: `We have searched the on-line

       databases, current House and weekly House, and we have been unable to locate the above quotation attributed to Mr Katter by Senator Collins in the Senate on 26 September 1995.' Not only is Senator Collins telling a flagrant untruth but on the second count he said that I considered women second-class citizens. If they were staying at home and not working then I would not consider them second-class; I would consider them first-class citizens.

         There is a sense of deja vu about this. As I delightfully raise and support this matter of public importance, I cast my mind back. I happen to remember November 1975 in another parliament sitting opposite the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who was known at the time as the member for Heffron. He was in opposition and I was in government. It was 11 November 1975, which is perhaps why I remember it so well. I happened to move a motion in the New South Wales state parliament in support of the operations of Mascot airport, twin parallel runways on a north-south axis—the building of a third runway, in effect—and expanding the use of wide-bodied jets to reduce the number of jet movements in the area of Mascot. Remembering that there were not many wide-bodied jets in full operation at that time. The Airbus, 767s and others have come on stream since then.

         I then looked at the speech given by the Minister for Transport 20 years ago. I find that I am in agreement with some aspects of his speech. Those aspects made up not a bad speech 20 years ago. In the course of that examination of the state

         , I found that he was in support of part 2(a) of my resolution with regard to wide-bodied aircraft. But, with regard to the third runway, he got that wrong then, and he has got it wrong now. He spoke up in opposition to the third runway at that time. It is a little embarrassing, as he is the minister who then presided over the completion of the construction of the third runway. He championed its cause when he eventually brought on the official opening at about the worst possible time last year.

         It is instructive to go back through the detail of the speech of the then member for Heffron, the now federal Minister for Transport, which he made 20 years ago in the New South Wales state parliament. Some of us have long memories. Some of us will hold you accountable for the complete mess the government has made with regard to the operation of Australia's largest gateway airport.

         —I will answer that in a moment, Minister. Wait your turn. I made contact as a private citizen, and as an identified federal member of parliament, with an officer of Airservices Australia. What he told me about the Tullamarine operation this month, this week, was pretty interesting. He confirmed that, yes, there were two crossover runways—0927, the east-west runway, and 1634, the north-south runway.

         He confirmed, as well he might—and it is a matter of public record; it is not confidential—that Tullamarine is used for Simops, known by that name internationally for that type of operation, on a regular basis winds permitting. Separate to that, Tullamarine is also used for independent interspersed operations. The difference is a technical one. When they are using it for Simops, it is when they are using both runways for landings interspersed and one runway for take-offs at the same time. That is Simops. When they are using it for independent interspersed, it is when they are using the north-south runway for landings, for argument's sake, and the east-west runway for take-offs, which is the frequent pattern to maximise usability.

         I thought I would test this at the coalface. I have a contact, who is not well known to me but is one I respect, who operates as a captain of pure jet aircraft here in Australia. Earlier this month, he chose to land, as part of his program and schedule, at Tullamarine in that particular jet. He landed into the south. He decided upon taxiing in to just check with the tower because he noticed the aircraft were taking off east-west on this particular occasion while he was landing interspersed on the north-south runway. The tower at Tullamarine replied, `This is the preferred runway operation for maximum utilisation—planes taking off to the west and landing from the north.'

What the coalition, what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), is responsibly proposing is to provide the intersection to be where it is most controllable and most safe, and where it is the logical place to provide it—that is, on the ground at Mascot—as opposed to the government's alternative operation of Mascot which is to provide the crossover of aircraft traffic at low altitude in the suburbs to the north and south of Mascot.

It is interesting to hear that a couple of weeks ago Ansett and Qantas came out and said that they did not support the opening of the east-west runway. Some of their management have intimated otherwise in private discussions with members of the coalition. I am not going to do the wrong thing in regard to those discussions. I respect the confidentiality of the people involved. It actually goes further than that.

If you look at the map of all of the surrounding seats, it is very clear that there are only two seats that are truly highly marginal, and they are both on the alignment. There are actually three—there is one of ours, but it is nowhere near as marginal as the other two. Lowe is our seat at 5.1 per cent, which is reasonably marginal, but the two really marginal seats are Bennelong with 3.2 per cent and Cook with 3.5 per cent. They are at either end of that parallel runway configuration.

The accident in Tenerife was the world's worst accident to date with two wide-bodied jets. On that occasion, had that Boeing 747 of Qantas which was parked at the intersection been taken out by the Ansett domestic jet and the Thai Airways DC10—there were only three seconds in it—it would have been, heaven forbid, the world's worst accident.

        Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity.

Let me go through that advice because it is not just the Civil Air Officers Association that has given us advice. The Civil Aviation Authority gave us advice and said, `Don't do it, minister. Don't do it.' Air Services Australia went further. They said they would not let us do it. They reaffirmed their position on 14 August saying that while parallel runways were available at Sydney airport it—that is Air Services Australia—would not be prepared to restore simultaneous independent operations using east-west runways in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system.

        It is as clear as a pikestaff. Having been cut down yesterday in respect of Los Angeles and Heathrow—in fact every airport you mentioned—you come in here today and throw in a couple more. Today you threw in Adelaide and Melbourne. The traffic in Melbourne is 134,000 movements compared with Sydney with 239,000. Adelaide has 96,000 movements. Of course you can do all sorts of things safely when you are moving only half or one-third as much traffic. It is dead easy.

In the debate this afternoon the Leader of the National Party of Australia was reflecting on the integrity of James Strong and the general manager of Ansett Airlines, Graham McMahon. Mr Fischer said that the airlines had done a backflip and that they had been dragged screaming. Let me read to the House exactly what they said because it is terribly serious advice. These people are terrified of what the opposition has in mind—and why wouldn't they be? Their experts have told them—and they know—that this cannot be done.

         —There is one reason and one reason only why the government has been so stunned by the `not for sale' sign hung out by the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) over Sydney airport: it is that the Prime Minister and member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) now wears Australia's privatisation crown. It is now the Prime Minister, and no-one else, who wants to sell off the family silver. It is the Prime Minister who is worshipping at the altar of economics. It is the Prime Minister who has swallowed the economic textbook. It is the Prime Minister who would sell his grandmother if he thought he would get a decent price for her. Fear is spreading through the ranks of the ALP because it has been stuck with this unpopular privatisation policy. Fear is creeping across its back bench the way the bald spot is creeping across the Prime Minister's scalp. Just the other day the Prime Minister boasted to caucus about the fantastic scare campaign he was going to run against the opposition. The fact of the matter is that our policy is to open Badgerys Creek airport. Our policy is to send the big jets west. Our policy is to reduce noise all round. Please, please, Prime Minister, run a scare campaign on that. That is not scary at all. The only people who are scared by the coalition's policy—and I can see them arguing like cats and dogs up the back there now—are the Prime Minister's own backbench.

         , privatisation means that Badgerys Creek will never be built. It means that Sydney west can remain `an intention' forever. This government's privatisation bill contains no requirement that the private operator must construct Badgerys Creek, places no obligation on the private operator to shift in the near future or at all from Kingsford Smith to Badgerys Creek, establishes no statutory limits on the operation of Kingsford Smith, and creates a competitive environment which acts as an incentive to maximise aircraft and passenger movement through Kingsford Smith. That is the truth. This government's policy means that all the people of inner western Sydney will be prisoners forever of Kingsford Smith airport. They have a life sentence to aircraft noise under the privatisation policy of this government.

        That is the direct opposite of what the Leader of the National Party is now arguing, together with the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). They are not my words. They are the words of the Leader of the National Party when he was a member of the New South Wales parliament. So let us nail the hypocrisy of the opposition. The reason that they are interested in this proposal now has nothing to do with policy. It is not policy driven. It is driven by the polls. It is driven by those seats on the north-south axis—the seat of the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, where the margin is only 3.2 per cent and the seat of Cook where it is only 3.5 per cent. And we have just had the election to Hunters Hill of a mayor from the No Aircraft Noise Party. Also, it is directed, in effect, at shoring up the opposition's position.

        That is why they are concerned about what is happening at Sydney airport. That is why they are concerned about the east-west runway—for pure, crass political motives, not for policy reasons.

This is evidenced by what the Leader of the National Party said in the New South Wales state parliament on 11 November 1975 and by various other quotes. They were leading the cheer squad, as was the then New South Wales Liberal-National Party, for the construction of the third runway. But it is their pollsters who are driving the opposition agenda at the moment. It is a policy free opposition but it is one driven by the pollsters.

We saw the U-turn by the Leader of the Opposition after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered his blueprint for a republic. Again, it was poll driven. We have a poll driven opposition.

We argued in the other place—and my colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, moved an amendment—to ensure that the government's proposals, which would have dramatically increased the reporting requirements on large exempt proprietary companies, were amended so as to ensure that these companies would continue under the existing reporting requirements if they wished to do so. The amendment would allow them to continue to choose between having an auditor or lodging simple key financial data.

         The government's proposal, as we understood it before the amendments, was to force these companies not only to have an auditor but also to lodge financial returns. Under the Corporations Law, exempt proprietary companies were able to choose between appointing an auditor or lodging key financial data. The government in failing to support the amendment showed itself to be no friend to the business community—and that, after all, is where many jobs come from. Many businesses raised concerns about the bill with the coalition. The cost of undertaking a full audit, which the bill now requires, was a particular concern. That is the reason we picked up that argument and advanced it in the other place.

         Despite the fact that the government has rejected our amendment and maintained the existing proposal—that is, for reporting requirements for large exempt proprietary companies—there were in the way in which this matter was dealt with some good news for businesses affected. The coalition was successful in getting the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities to review the bill for a second time. Because we pushed for that review the government agreed to clarify the conditions under which the Australian Securities Corporation can grant an exemption from audit. This could be of benefit and ought to be of benefit to a significant number of companies that had concerns about these new requirements. So there is this exemption proposal. We do not regard it as the best option but it is obviously an improvement.

         Since Minister Bilney has departed, I say to Minister Walker, who is at the table, that there are several questions I would like to place on the record to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Firstly, does he still have faith in the Indian legal system that has treated Dr Flynn fairly? Secondly, does he believe that justice delayed is justice denied? There is a perception that the Australian government has not pressed Dr Flynn's case because they think he is guilty. Does the Australian government think that Dr Flynn is guilty?

In government, we will put in train a number of ministerial, diplomatic and consular initiatives that will enhance the situation of Australians travelling overseas.

         —As is well known in this House, the Australian Labor Party is a strong supporter of local government. Indeed, it was the Australian Labor Party, through the Brisbane constitutional convention of 1985, which eventually got the question of constitutional recognition of local government to a referendum. It was the conservatives of this country who totally opposed that constitutional recognition of local government. In Victoria's local government we see that they not only hate Australian workers but also hate democracy and local government.

         I have long been a supporter of rational amalgamation and restructure of local government in Victoria. There were in fact 210 councillors in Victoria when I served in local government. But my support for amalgamation and restructure is not support for what the Jeffrey Gibb Kennett government has achieved in Victoria through his political apparatchiks. When I say `political apparatchiks', that is exactly what they were because the local government board was headed by a Liberal Party member.

         Instead of the community being asked what sorts of changes they wanted, it was totally imposed upon local communities. For example, the old Mansfield shire was amalgamated with the city of Benalla. To give you an idea, the entire town of Mansfield closed down in protest for being lumped in with another body without any consultation. The way this amalgamation was done really has been a major political embarrassment for the government in Victoria. The boundaries are a joke and, of course, politically inspired.

         They say they have in fact improved local government in Victoria. Yet they have created municipalities such as the shire of Strathbogie, which will now be known in Victoria as the New Pyalong. Pyalong was one of the very small municipalities for some 650 ratepayers. Pyalong has gone but they have created Strathbogie in its place—a municipality which does not conform to all of the research which indicated what should be done to local government in Victoria.

         The politicisation of the local government system in Victoria has been compounded by the fact that, instead of calling for elections and letting democracy take its place in the restructured areas, political appointees were put in as commissioners. That is no secret. Some 27 per cent of the people appointed, called commissioners—it is almost Stalinist—are members of the Liberal Party. The chief commissioner is paid some $90,000 and the two other commissioners—they are not chiefs—are paid some $60,000 a year. They have given themselves mobile phones, new cars and fax machines, along with all of the perks of office on top. The commissioners are in fact costing a hell of a lot more than the volunteer councillors who used to run local government in Victoria.

         The commissioners are not responsible to the people whom they purportedly represent because they are not elected. In fact, none of them live in the municipalities over which they now have dictatorial control. These commissioners in Victoria are dictated to by the Minister for Local Government and the local government board. For example, Kennett said that they would cut rates by 20 per cent uniformly across the state on these new councils irrespective of whether that is good or bad for the district or whether they could afford it or not.

         Most of us here have a rough idea of what revenue is and what income is. Would anyone here agree, for example, that $3 million worth of asset sales and a $1 million transfer from reserves is income? It is a one-off and it is not income, yet we are now seeing local government accounts in Victoria showing one-off asset sales as income. They are showing transfers from reserve as income. That is the reserve that former democratically elected councillors put aside for capital works. They are bringing these reserves back in on their current income account and saying, `We have a surplus.'

There is no democracy, but shonky accounting and commissioners running councils in a Stalinist style not for the benefit of the people but for the benefit of the Liberal Party of Victoria. It is a shame.

         Cherry-Dell contacted me the other day about a deceptive method alternative telephone carriers are using to sign up new customers. The carriers are doing this by offering charities and other organisations benefits by getting them to enlist their subscribers or members. They do this by bulk buying or hiring lines off Telstra at reduced rates, and then renting these lines to customers, via a charity or organisation, with the offer of cheaper rates for the customers, plus benefits to the charity or organisation through whom they apply for the connection. Cherry-Dell wrote to me about this. Her letter stated:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I signed with the Cancer Foundation thinking by the conditions written on them that I was getting a reduction in the cost of my calls and that the annual rebate could help the Cancer Foundation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On getting my Telecom bill, I discovered that my service was taken over by another carrier. Now this also means I lost my sole parent concession. Fly buys have been cancelled, and any other existing flex plans I had as a customer with Telecom have also been cancelled.
       </para>
       <para>
        In getting a discount, Cherry-Dell was meant to receive a six per cent reduction, but only received three per cent—another deception. She goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What I object to is the dishonesty in this deal—the use of charities and organisations names to draw subscribers away from their existing service. These people can steal customers away from Telecom and yet Telecom are not permitted to let their subscribers know what is lost by their signing with these other carriers. It is okay if that is explained what we are signing, but it is not clear. Age pensioners are vulnerable because if they sign, thinking they are just getting a discount, they then discover they have lost the Telecom pension concession, and may not know why.
       </para>
       <para>
        What happens essentially is that members of charities or organisations receive an offer asking, for example, `Do you want a discount on your telephone bills and to help this charity at the same time?' Of course it sounds like a great deal, so people tick the box saying yes. What they do not realise, as Cherry-Dell pointed out, is that they will be disconnected from their existing carrier and connected with a new one who has bulk bought or hired the lines off Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Some organisations or businesses also rent out the lines to charities and the like, so instead of charities or whichever group renting or buying the lines in bulk off Telstra direct they get them second hand from another organisation who is buying or renting the lines off Telstra. So some organisations are buying or renting the lines, and I imagine they are then writing to charities or sporting clubs or the like and saying, `Have we got a deal for you.' They would offer the organisation the opportunity to offer their members and subscribers discounts on telephone calls plus, for every member they sign up, the organisation would get a donation. They just do not tell them that they will be disconnected from their existing carrier, and that is where I agree with my constituent.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If they told people the whole story that would be fine,  but people are being disconnected from their existing carrier without their knowledge or consent. As was pointed out to me by Cherry-Dell, if the customers are on a flexi plan, pension benefit or even in Fly Buys they will also lose that benefit, unbeknown to them.

People who are renting off Telstra are being conned to join other carriers when they want to remain with Telstra. Telstra is aware of this but at this stage can do nothing.

It is going to be one of the great titanic struggles in Australian Rules between two sides that have earned the respect of the sporting world in this particular code. I will tell you, Mr Speaker, at the end of this adjournment speech who is going to win that game.

         This is the fourth grand final that Geelong has contested in seven years which, by anybody's measuring stick, is a great achievement. We have recently seen at the club changes in coaching personnel, changes in playing personnel and a restructuring of the club. Yet it has managed to propel itself to the very top of the league table in this premier football code in Australia.

         Some very important changes have been made to the coaching staff. I would like to pay tribute here tonight to the efforts of the very young coach of Geelong, Gary Ayres. Gary came to the club from the Hawthorn football club, the famous Hawthorn stable, and has a real wealth of finals experience behind him. He has brought a new dimension to the free-flowing Geelong game, and he has brought some great stability to the players of the club.

         But my heart tonight, 48 hours away from victory, goes to the President of the Geelong Football Club, Ron Hovey. Ron has been a great stalwart of the Geelong Football Club for the past three decades. I know from speaking to him earlier on in the week and speaking to him last week before the preliminary final that this particular game and this victory will mean a lot to him, as they will to the people of Geelong.

         This game means a lot to the city of Geelong, because it gives the city an opportunity to profile itself in both a sporting and other sense to the rest of the nation. As you would know, Mr Speaker, in recent years Geelong has been hit by recession, by industry restructuring and by the financial collapse of the Pyramid Building Society. But the people in the city are a very resilient people. They have come through that period of their history with flying colours. The total weight of the city now sits behind the Geelong Football Club and the players in this contest on Saturday.

         To the players, let me say this: these opportunities to play at this national level and to play in one of the premier sporting events of the world come very rarely in one's sporting life and those opportunities must be grasped with both hands. I will give this advice to the players that was given to me in my `illustrious' football career: play like there is no tomorrow, show them no mercy and take no prisoners. If you want to put a little wager on it, Mr Speaker: Geelong by 27 points.

My only regret, of course, is that there is not a Queensland team in the AFL grand final. One can only hope that the situation will remedy itself next year.

          I came into the House tonight to congratulate the conservative action team at the University of Queensland which recently won the union elections. Before I come to that particular matter, I want to comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) when he criticised the actions of the Victorian government with respect to local authority amalgamations. When he criticised the Victorian government, he could well have been criticising the Goss Labor government, which has really forced very many local authorities into a situation of amalgamation without consulting the local communities at all.

          —It is extraordinary and outrageous that there should be these kinds of changes in local authority boundaries without the consent of the local people. But it did not stop on the Darling Downs. The city of Ipswich and the shire of Moreton were amalgamated in a special election just 12 months after the local authority elections which took place throughout Queensland. The state minister arbitrarily sacked all the councillors and called fresh elections for the amalgamated local city. What he did was pass one area of Carole Park away from Moreton shire and put it into Brisbane, leaving that area totally without representation until the next general election of local authorities.

          This union is one of the few student unions in Australia not to join the National Union of Students. I think it is absolutely outrageous that in Queensland students at the University of Queensland are forced to be in the student union. They have not got the right to choose whether they want to join or whether they do not want to join. It is absolutely outrageous that this situation is permitted to continue by the Goss Labor Government. I believe that the unacceptable activities of the left wing of the ALP, which has controlled the University of Queensland Union up until recently, have resulted in such a swing to the conservative action team. I also congratulate the Australian Liberal Students Federation on the excellent job they do on university campuses throughout Australia.

         —On 24 August I moved a motion in the House of Representatives calling for a joint federal-state inquiry into the Hilton Hotel bombing in 1978. This followed, in 1991, the unanimous decision of the New South Wales parliament calling also for a joint federal-state inquiry. Since that time another motion has been passed in the New South Wales parliament, again calling for a joint federal-state inquiry. I notice that a similar motion to mine is now on the Senate

         It is high time we got to the bottom of who was responsible for the bombing of the Hilton Hotel. I believe there are no further excuses. We need this joint federal-state inquiry.

         Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has supposedly opened the files held by the New South Wales government on this matter. When Terry Griffiths, one of the victims of the bombing, went down to look at the files he was told that eight particular files were restricted: he could not look at them. When he phoned the Premier's office to ask why, he was told that the New South Wales government had opened the files but the Commonwealth government had placed restrictions on eight of those files. I would like to know why that is. There may be a very good reason.

          —The opportunity to speak on the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration affords me the opportunity of looking at bank closures throughout Australia in recent years. The committee has considered this issue, and it is one of particular importance to rural communities. I note that page 25 of the report says that the committee has had discussions with the Reserve Bank and also the Australian Bankers Association regarding what they believe has been a major concern—and I want to reinforce that concern—that consumers in rural areas are feeling the impact and effect of bank closures right throughout Australia.

          It has been particularly evident in Victoria, where the Commonwealth Bank, when it took over the former State Bank of Victoria, has been one of the signal offenders in this matter. The Commonwealth Bank has closed many hundreds of small branches throughout country and rural areas, and of course this action has caused a great deal of concern amongst those communities. I particularly note that the committee has said that it is interested to monitor the progress of this approach to servicing small business. The committee's concern was whether small businesses and the farming community would be serviced, with the loss of banks from this particular rural and country environment, and the committee is going to monitor the progress of the new approach to servicing small business, particular in regional Australia. I commend the committee for pursuing that issue, because it is important to people throughout rural Australia that they still have access to business and also to private banking facilities.

          The question of branch closures and the introduction of new technology has been an emotional issue, and will continue to be an emotional issue for a lot of people, because one seems to link hand in hand with the other in terms of job losses and closure of branches. The committee found that the arguments put forward by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the banks appear to be quite rational, but it believes that there is a need for a more comprehensive picture of what is happening with regard to branch closures and the strategies for the future in terms of new forms of access to banking services, and it is also going to pursue that matter.

          I raise this issue because we have recently had a branch of the Westpac bank close in Inglewood, a small town in my electorate, and the closure caused a great deal of concern because it left that community without any formal banking facilities. People there do have access to some other banking facilities, but not in terms of loan approvals and applications or in terms of the general commercial activities that a bank might normally be expected to provide. The closure caused a great deal of concern in the community, so I am pleased that the committee is going to continue to pursue that matter. I will be watching the progress of the committee deliberations on that matter because it is a very important issue for rural communities.

          I also wish to refer to the section of the committee's report, on page 27, which looked at the financial institutions duty and the debits tax which used to be known as the BAD tax—the bank account debits tax. I note that the Australian Bankers Association raised the issue of the FID and the debits tax with the committee, recommending that they should be abolished as they are `distortive, regressive and inefficient'. These taxes, they note, are levied by state governments. In these days of perusal and concern about the banking industry's activities about charges, here is an element that certainly requires much more investigation.

          I know that states are dependent upon these taxes for their revenue raising, but I was interested to read that the ABA, and the committee, found that there was a distortive, regressive and inefficient element of these particular taxes. The committee obviously will be following that issue up. I note that it has requested additional material from the Australian Bankers Association on the impact of these taxes, the compliance costs and the total value of deposits into the banking system which relate to these specific taxes. The committee has noted that it will further examine the concerns raised by the Australian Bankers Association.

          People are becoming much more aware of taxes and charges to do with banking. It is certainly under the microscope at the moment and it will obviously generate a lot more interest when the committee examines the concerns. One would hope that it might have public hearings on this where the community could come and give evidence on the impact of these taxes on their businesses and the way their businesses operate, so that the committee can be fully informed of the impact of those two taxes—the financial institutions duty and the debits tax.

          The question of derivatives is also tackled by the committee. I had the opportunity to go to the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney last Friday to receive a briefing on not only the activities of the derivatives market but also the activities of the Australian Stock Exchange. I must say that they put on a very impressive briefing session for the members of my committee who were there. I found that they certainly are world leaders in technology and in efficiency in the management and operation of the Australian Stock Exchange, and that they were taking a very innovative and entrepreneurial approach with the regulation of the Australian market.

          We were also briefed on the Australian derivatives market. Derivatives are an important aspect of financial management, particularly in risk management, and it is important that people understand how they operate and how they can be used as risk management instruments.

         However, they did not go on to say that people should be educated to understand how the derivatives market works. I think there is a bit of a gap in the knowledge of people in the community on how these derivatives work and the risks that are attached—and there are risks, but it is a matter of how you can properly manage those risks. You cannot manage those risks without having the knowledge of how that derivatives market works.

          The other issue that I want to address in the report is on page 5 and it refers to lending for housing. Lending for housing is a very important issue in Australia because there are many thousands of people trying to get into the housing market. You might recall that in the lead-up to the 1993 election the Keating government promised the Australian public that it would allow access to superannuation funds for use as housing loans. That promise was never fulfilled. It was quickly forgotten after the 1993 election. There were many thousands of people, and young people in particular, who were paying into superannuation schemes and who were hopeful of having access to their superannuation funds so that they could finance a home.

          The government let them down extremely badly on this issue. Here was an opportunity for people to gain access to some of their superannuation funds and use the funds as a deposit on a home. However, that promise was not fulfilled. That is an important issue. Australians want to have their own home. They see that as one of the best financial investments that they can make during their lifetime. They want to have a home of their own for they see it as a major asset and they are prepared to pay it off during their lifetime. The government made that promise but after the election it made no effort whatsoever to enable people to access some of those superannuation funds.

          I want to mention now the changes that are going on in the housing finance market and the changes that are going on in the banking industry. In Bendigo we had probably one of the most successful building societies in the state. The Bendigo Building Society was one of the largest home lenders in the state. It concentrated principally on home lending, with 80 per cent of its funding going to that sector. It has been very successful. It survived the crash of Pyramid and the trauma that occurred in Victoria as a result of that crash.

It has gone from strength to strength and has recently been converted into a bank known as the Bendigo Bank. It has just had a successful launch and it is doing particularly well. However, there are a number of changes occurring throughout Australia in the financial world at the moment. There is a heavy emphasis on the big banks with them eyeing off with predatory eyes a lot of these regional banks. Time will tell what eventuates but we have seen some changes in Western Australia with the bank of Western Australia being taken over recently by a Scottish bank, and there will be more and more changes.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I could not be more pleased to see you in the chair for a debate of this nature, knowing your wide experience of commercial matters, particularly of futures markets and the like. You would be very adept at passing a stern eye over the objectives of the Trade Marks Bill 1995.

         This bill represents the end of the line of a long process of overhauling Australian trademarks legislation. That process began in 1989 when the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business authorised the Registrar of Trade Marks to set up a working party to review existing legislation. That working party was chaired by the Registrar of Trade Marks and it included a mixed representation from the Trade Marks Office, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Patents Attorneys of Australia.

         After working through a complicated process, including an initial phase of public consultation, the working party eventually produced its final report to the then minister in July 1992. The working party's report proposed the repeal of the Trade Marks Act 1995 and its replacement with a new act, incorporating several major changes.

         Although there was a consensus within the working party on the majority of the report's recommendations, there was a small number of important issues on which the views of the Trade Marks Office representatives differed from those of the private sector representatives. Initially there was to be a further period of public consultation before new legislation would be drafted. However, in September 1992, a full four months before the proposed closing date for receipt of submissions, the then minister decided that he could not wait for public comments, but would proceed with new draft legislation forthwith.

         Early last year, the minister released an exposure draft of the 1994 bill. On the cover of that exposure draft it was said that the bill was in draft form and was not finally settled, and that one of the purposes of releasing it was to test it for errors and omissions. The original working party apparently had no involvement in drafting the bill. Although members of the working party received a copy prior to its release, there was no time to correct even the most obvious errors.

         On 27 July last year, the minister issued a press release stating that the government would enact the 1994 bill without awaiting the results of the process of public consultation, the reason being that, under the agreement to establish the World Trade Organisation, Australia had to enact legislation consistent with the TRIPS agreement. Accordingly, the 1994 bill was debated and passed as part of a legislative package designed to ensure that Australia met its obligations under the agreement to establish the WTO. At the time however, the minister acknowledged the requirement to take account of public submissions on this issue and pledged to complete the process of consultation, before introducing amendments at the earliest possible opportunity.

         The bill that we are debating today is the outcome of that stretched process. It is largely a rewrite of the Trade Marks Act 1994, which has not yet come into effect. It makes a number of technical changes to the 1994 act to overcome drafting errors, but there are also a number of areas of substantial difference. In addition, there are a number of noteworthy areas of common ground between this bill and the 1994 act. I will make a few brief comments on those.

         One area that is worthy of comment is the expanded definition of a trademark provided in this bill. Under existing law, registrable trademarks have been largely confined to signs consisting of words, letters, numerals, figurative elements or a combination of one or more of these. The 1994 act provides for an expanded definition of a trademark and this bill goes slightly further. It is now proposed that a trademark may extend to include such things as an aspect of packaging, a shape, a colour, sound or scent. The 1992 working party report commented that, given recent developments in marketing and technology, there is a need for Australian legislation to cater for a wider range of signs than had previously been considered capable of functioning as a trademark.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It must be noted that a broader definition is consistent with the direction of the TRIPS agreement and with recent changes in legislation in a number of industrialised nations. However, some aspects of the broader definition have raised concern that the scope of the new trademarks may now be too wide and that this could encroach on other areas of intellectual property. I note that one of the minor parties in the Senate put forward an amendment to restrict the definition of a trademark to a more conventional scope. They argued that by broadening the definition we would simply open the gates to legal challenge. According to their argument:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many manufacturers are already lining up to legally `try on' trademarks such as scents for perfume, or the fragrance of wine. While the current trademark regulators would exclude this, who knows what the future will bring or what the courts may decide? . . . This bill involves the reversal of the onus of proof, so that now the regulators must prove why a trademark should not be issued. This is of great significance in light of the inevitability of legal challenge on sensory labelling. It will result in substantial litigation costs. If trademarks referred to only conventional labels, however, the reversal would be quite appropriate in regulation of logos, names and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opposition notes these concerns. However, in this instance we have decided not to tamper with the legislation. We accept the government's argument that there is sufficient international precedent to justify such a widening of the definition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Furthermore, we are satisfied that the provisions relating to the grounds for rejecting an application and the provisions relating to the grounds for opposing registration of a trademark provide sufficient safeguards against misuse of the expanded definition. In particular, I think that the requirement that a sign constituting a trademark must be able to be represented graphically is likely to severely constrain the scope of certain sounds or scents to be incorporated in such a registrable trademark.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, we do not believe that advances in marketing and technology should be unnecessarily constrained by government legislation. However, we will monitor the situation and look forward to industry feedback on the operation of the expanded scope of trademarks. Should it prove unworkable or lead to excessive litigation, an incoming coalition government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue.

         One of the most significant features of this bill is the reversal of the onus of registrability which appears in section 33. According to the second reading speech:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill is expressed in terms that make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when an application is being examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks. This means that, if there is any doubt about whether a trademark should be registered, that doubt will be resolved in favour of the applicant rather than against the applicant as is now the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        There should be considerable advantages in terms of minimising the cost to the applicant of complying with the requirements for registration and minimising the risks of wrongful rejection. The onus is placed squarely on the Registrar of Trade Marks to establish why a given trademark should not be registered. However, it is worth noting that the provisions dealing with the grounds for rejection of an application, sections 39 to 44, still leave the registrar with a considerable discretion. Moreover, the process of appeal is neither simple nor costless.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In my comments during last year's debate I indicated that a number of concerns with the original bill had been raised with me by practising patent and trademark attorneys. One of these related to the proposal to scrap the existing part B of the register of trademarks. The 1992 working party examined this issue and was of a divided opinion. Those members of the working party from the Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys felt there were strong grounds for the retention of a divided register. They apparently based the view on the perceived significant advantages presently accorded part A registrations, the benefit of which should be accorded only to the proprietors of distinctive marks.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In contrast, the Trade Marks Office members of the working party felt that the advantages of retaining a divided register were largely illusory. Instead, they argued that there would be significant advantages in terms of cost and efficiency for both regulators and trademark users by streamlining the register into a single entity.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the Law Council and the institute members acknowledged that a single register would reduce the administrative workload of the Trade Marks Office, they still felt that this was insufficient justification for extending monopoly rights and for changing a system which, on the face of it, had served Australia well for many years. Moreover, they argued that the GATT TRIPS agreement prescribed only minimal requirements for a register and that the maintenance of a divided register would not be inconsistent with Australia's international obligations.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The opposition acknowledges that there are divided opinions on this issue. However, we accept that the historical reasons for maintaining a divided register probably no longer apply and that, on balance, the benefits of increased efficiency and reduced cost of administering an undivided register should outweigh any cost in terms of re-weighting of the rights of the trademark owners currently in different parts of the register.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another issue that was raised in relation to the 1994 act was a proposal to streamline the provisions relating to associated trademarks, these being trademarks used by a business which are substantially identical or similar and are used in relation to similar goods and services.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The new bill goes even further. It scraps the concept of associated trademarks altogether. I note that this is a departure from the majority recommendation of the working report. In that report the Law Council and the institute members recommended the retention of the existing provisions for association—defined under the Trade Marks Act of 1955.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Indeed, the Law Council and institute members of the working party argued that the association system provides important information to trademark proprietors, enabling them to ascertain whether or not a set of trademarks can validly be transferred to another proprietor. They suggested that to repeal these provisions would upset the balance presently achieved between ensuring the validity of registrations and the efficiency of examination procedures.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the Trade Marks Office members of the working party agreed with the principle underlying the existing association provisions, they argued that existing provisions were cumbersome and resource intensive to administer and, further, that most other industrialised countries—including USA—have no association provisions in their legislation.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government justifies its decision to do away with associated trademarks altogether on the grounds that, firstly, it is consistent with international practice and, secondly, such action was supported by a majority of submissions received during the process of public consultation.

         The opposition can see merit in the protection of the existing system of association. However, it is accepted that the costs of administering the system are probably disproportionate to consumer benefit on the grounds that there are other safeguards within the bill that offer protection against deception or confusion as a result of the change in ownership of the existing mark.

         As a final point I would like to comment briefly on the issue of registered users. Part II of the Trade Marks Act 1994 made provision for owners of trademarks to authorise use of their marks by registered users. This bill omits any provision for registered users. The second reading speech states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill provides that where owners of trade marks exercise control over use of their trade marks by other persons, that use can be taken to be use by the new owner . . . The WTO agreement does not require use under the control of the owner of the trade mark to be registered. Consequently, there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new provisions relating to authorised users appear to provide similar rights to those provided in the 1994 act for registered users, but without the same administrative costs and complexities. Under the new system, a greater weight of responsibility is placed on the registered owner and this may pose some potential problems if the owner is less than diligent in ensuring the appropriate use of trademarks under their control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The entire field of intellectual property is a complex one, and one which yields a range of competing interests. Consequently, trademark legislation, if it is to be in the best interests of Australian people, must seek to achieve a fair, equitable and efficient balancing of these competing interests. This bill has been through an extensive process of public consultation. It is to be hoped that, as a result, the opinions of all interested parties have at least been given adequate consideration.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I trust this bill will give us a modern, workable system of trademarks. It is essential that we develop a system of trademarks which is responsive to the changing requirements of Australian industry, but which also pays heed to the interests of the consumer. I am not convinced that this bill is without potential problems. However, I can give an assurance that, in government, the coalition will be responsive to the best interests of trademark users and will certainly be prepared to amend any aspects of this legislation which prove to be defective in practice.

But I would have to acknowledge that under the tutelage of the honourable member for Ryan my knowledge of matters commercial has increased.

         Having said that, I think this piece of legislation is interesting. It is an important aspect of commercial law. It is important not only for the protections that it gives to business but also, as has been said by both speakers so far in this debate today, for the protection that it can give to consumers. If we really want to understand the protections that are offered by trademarks it is important to have some understanding of the history surrounding them in our law and in the world of commerce.

         The Labor Party has played a significant role in the introduction of appropriate legislation throughout the history of the federation. When Alfred Deakin became Prime Minister for the second time in July 1905, it was with the support of the Australian Labor Party that the original legislation concerning the regulation of trademarks was passed. More generally, the Labor movement has consistently recognised the importance of protecting symbols which distinguish the products and work of individuals and groups of people from those of other individuals and groups, and their use in informing consumers.

         The Brewery Employees Union of New South Wales registered its own union label in 1906. The purpose of this union mark was to indicate that a particular good had been manufactured through the services of members of that union. The establishment of that time took a somewhat dim view of this practice and sought to stop it on the basis that the union mark was not a legitimate trademark. It is easy to see why the manufacturers at the time did not like these marks. With them, unions were able to demonstrate clearly to the consumers which goods and services had been produced with unionised labour. Trade union orientated consumers could then make their purchasing decisions based on the union label.

         At the time, the High Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the power constitutionally to make laws for marks used to identify the suppliers of services. Thus the union label was unable to be registered and was unprotected, and its intended purpose was stymied. Time altered this view, and it became generally accepted that subsequent legal decisions did not substantiate the original decision.

         When the Trade Marks Office opened in Melbourne in 1906, the first day of trading saw 750 applications lodged: a strong indication that, even back then, Australians were a creative and resourceful lot. An interesting aspect of trademark legislation is that the Australian colonies implemented trademark protection some 10 years before Britain did, exemplifying that we are often ahead on legal reforms, too. Some of the earliest registered trademarks reflected the new status of the Commonwealth of Australia, which had been united and federated only five years earlier. The trademark images presented the new awareness of the national identity that Australians had discovered. Many trademarks consisted of maps and animal images common to all Australians, or of the Southern Cross or the Eureka flag.

         Indeed, looking through the trademark register provides a unique opportunity to closely examine Australian history since Federation. Economic circumstances are mirrored in the numbers and types of trademarks registered, and trends and images of the times are always represented. During World War 1 and World War 11, registrations dipped dramatically and were followed by huge postwar increases as trade again flourished. Likewise, the pages are lean around the time of the Great Depression. This legislation moves to make our notion of trademarks even more contemporary. In this instance, it now includes sound, smell and aspects of packaging.

         Also of interest is the way in which people thought that they could perhaps market a product. One of the more interesting developments of a trademark and name was of course the naming of the product that we now all know as Vegemite. The merchant who tried to launch this vegetable extract back in 1923 decided that he would call the product `Parwill'. This product was, of course, to oppose the successful English spread—of that time and now—Marmite. The merchant chose the name `Parwill' because he was going to market it under the slogan, `Marmite, but Parwill.' Given even that there was perhaps a subtle difference in the sense of humour of the time, that pun failed to really take off, so it was decided to have a competition to name the new product, and that is the way that the Vegemite trademark and name came about.

         Often, when people speak of the value of trademarks, they emphasise only the protection of the intellectual property aspects involved in the creation of the trademark and the protection of the rights of the owners of the trademark. However, the importance of a trademark needs to be recognised in terms not only of a name or image that it affords but also of the protection that the trademark offers to consumers. I believe that this aspect of trademarks legislation has been sadly neglected in the past, but I am pleased to see that the protection now offered to consumers was improved not only in the 1994 act but also in the bill now before the House.

         It is important that Minister Lee, in his second reading speech, said that Australian trademark laws served two complementary objectives: firstly, identification and protection of a business's products, and, secondly, protection of the consumer. In pamphlets and booklets that Ausindustry and AIPO publish, the value to the producers of trademarks is thus described:

       <para>
        It is a two-way street. The producer, manufacturer or supplier wants to identify something as its product; and, by having the trademark on a legislated basis, protection is given to consumers. Trademarks allow the consumer to know precisely what they are purchasing, thus preventing them from being deceived by false products and allowing them to make an informed judgment about what they will purchase.

         Of course, that outcome can be achieved only if we have a properly legislated and administered system—and, indeed, the policing that might flow from that. We know all too well of products that are sold either in the weekend markets of the cities and towns of Australia or even more predominantly in the street bazaars of countries overseas where the wrongful and deceitful use of well-known trademarks abounds. It is only through proper policing that the manufacturer is protected and the consumer has the protection of knowing that they are getting the proper goods that they believe they are purchasing.

         While it is obviously not, and should never be, the sole protector of consumer rights, legislation allowing protected naming rights to one company forms part of the legislative arrangements which protect consumers. For example, this bill proposes to provide registration protection not only to the goods and services themselves but also to closely related or similar items. The Trade Practices Commission will, under this bill, assess whether the registration of certification would be to the public detriment. This means that certifications according to quality will not be open to misuse. Involvement of the TPC offers consumer protection in this aspect as well.

         On balance, and taking on board some of the comments and criticisms that the shadow minister put on behalf of the coalition, I think that, in the same way that this legislation was developed, there will be a continuing review of the implementation of this bill from 1 January next year. That is always important. Another important aspect that has been mentioned in the debate is that this legislation continues to make contemporary the notion of a trademark, in the sense that we changed the notion of things that can be considered trademarks and of things that can be attached to goods and services.

         The bill is also contemporary because it acknowledges that now, in the world of commerce, Australia—through a whole host of measures, including its inclusion in the World Trade Organisation and the obligations that flow from that—must also have international considerations which would not only give protection to Australian products overseas but would likewise ensure that, when a product from overseas is brought into Australia, we can have a reasonable understanding that it is of a quality that goes with the trademark and associated symbols and identifications that the product has. With those short remarks, I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this bill. I am sure that, through the understanding that is developing, especially by consumers about their rights, this trademarks legislation will in its own small way assist consumers to make proper purchasing choices.

        This bill proposes a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 to implement the decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill.

         While the integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will generate only modest savings of approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and subsequent years, the government considers that significant benefits will result from the arrangements proposed in this bill. By drawing on the collective experience of both organisations and rationalising their corporate resources, the amalgamated body, which will be known as the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, will be better placed to develop innovative personnel management and service delivery arrangements.

         The integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will provide the public service, and the people of Australia generally, with tangible benefits.

         Similarly, integration with the Public Service Commission will provide staff of the agency with a better appreciation of the policy issues relevant to their casework activities. By drawing together the Public Service Commission's work on best practice and the MPRA's experience in merit protection and grievance resolution, the new commission's ability to contribute to the delivery of quality service to the Australian public will be greater than the sum of its individual parts.

         The government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation—fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The MPRA has an important role in preserving key values in Australian government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In the first 11 years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence.

         In developing this legislation, the government has been careful to ensure that the Public Service Commissioner and the Director of the MPRA, who will in future be known as Merit Protection Commissioner, will continue to exercise their statutory powers independently of each other. The powers of the MPRA in relation to the investigation of grievances and the resolution of disputes will be unaffected by these amendments, and it will be just as vigorous in protecting public servants' rights as it has always been. The government's intention is that the two commissioners should have a close and cooperative relationship, but that neither will be able to interfere in the other's statutory role.

         One necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the staff of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA, however, is that the Merit Protection Commissioner will no longer have the powers of a secretary in relation to the staff of the MPRA. Those powers will rest with the Public Service Commissioner, but the government expects the Public Service Commissioner to delegate his personnel management powers in relation to the staff of the commission who are required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act to the Merit Protection Commissioner. This will guarantee the continued independence of the MPRA from the Public Service Commission and ensure that there will be no diminution in the rights of public servants to independent appeal and grievance mechanisms as a result of this bill.

         Finally, the bill makes a number of other minor changes to the act. Members of the Merit Protection and Review Agency will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General in Council, on ministerial advice. However, the bill will require wider consultation on these appointments than is currently the case. In addition, the bill provides that only the Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to be appointed on a full-time basis. This in fact has been the situation since the MPRA was established in 1984 and the amendment does no more than reflect the reality of the current practice. I commend this bill to the House. I think the explanatory memorandum has already been presented.

         I was listening to the minister expound the virtues of putting together the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission. He said that there would be modest savings and I certainly agree with that. In expounding those virtues, he has reflected on the goodwill that will be required by the two commissioners to get on under the same roof. I note that one has somewhat lesser powers than the other and, because of the very nature of the beast, inevitably, one will dominate the proceedings, no matter what happens. We will be waiting to see how this particular exercise and that relationship pans out.

         We are aware that the report of the Public Service Act review group—the McLeod report—which was released in January, did not recommend this merger with the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Whether the goodwill that the minister was talking about prevails or whether the interests of the Public Service are downgraded is something that will only be seen in time. The McLeod review recommended that the merit agency remain separate. The agency itself, by its nature, is a joint union and management body, whereas the Public Service Commission is all about management structure. While the two are somewhat complementary, they are, of themselves, very different.

         They are there to look at the way in which a public servant can achieve some rectification of his complaint, which, in essence, would be about the administration of the Public Service Commission. The argument that would follow from that is that, if they are housed in the same area and with perhaps no goodwill between the two commissioners, that might lead to a situation where the public servant is not appropriately looked after. When we are in government, we would certainly monitor the progress of this and note its outcome. If it is not acting in the best interests of the Public Service, quite clearly, we would revisit the McLeod review recommendations and see what could best be done in that area.

This particular issue was raised by my colleague Senator Minchin at a Senate estimates committee hearing on 26 May. Ms Forward, the director of the MPRA, was being asked about this change that is coming and about the government's intention to merge the MPRA with the Public Service Commission. Senator Minchin said:

        That quite clearly indicates that she did not have much of an input into what was going to happen.

         Clearly the MPRA or its principal officers feel a greater degree of consultation was required before the decision on the agency's future was taken. That this consultation did not occur is a reflection on this government's commitment to both the principles and the practices of open government. If the government is unwilling to enter into consultations with its own employees, it is little wonder that the general public is somewhat cynical of its advocacy of open government.

         Ms Forward was hardly enthusiastic about the proposal when she was asked by Senator Bell what this move would achieve. In response to Senator Bell's claim that this bill returned the situation to that which applied before the agency was established in 1984, Ms Forward simply stated that would achieve savings of $214,000 in the year after next. This is far from enthusiastic endorsement of the bill from the most senior public servant in that area. That this response was forthcoming is hardly surprising. In the 1993-94 annual report of the MPRA, warnings against the loss of independence were made. The report says:

         In assessing the future of the MPRA it would be remiss of me not to examine one of the most contentious issues to emerge in recent years in the area of public sector employment. The MPRA has been the subject of criticism as a result of its investigation into allegations of workplace harassment at the Australian War Memorial. The subjects of that inquiry—the former director and the former deputy director—are seeking a Federal Court ruling to prevent the minister from considering the MPRA report on these allegations. While I have no intention of canvassing the details of that case, it should be noted that both the former executives claim that the MPRA exceeded its authority, and that they were denied natural justice and procedural fairness.

         However, now that this matter appears to be resolved and a decision is awaited, a number of questions relating to the MPRA need to be resolved. It must be explained whether or not the MPRA simply went trawling through the Australian War Memorial to justify bringing a case against the executives. The minister has a responsibility to advise whether or not the agency approached him seeking an invitation to conduct the inquiry into the War Memorial and when this occurred. If this was not the case, the minister must explain the conditions under which he requested the agency to investigate the relevant matters.

         —I support the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is before the Main Committee today. This is an area of considerable importance for members of parliament because of the way in which it affects the whole mechanism and operation of the government of Australia. The Australian Public Service has always played a very valuable role in impartially, competently and professionally administering the programs of Australian governments since the time of Federation.

         Australia has been particularly fortunate in the history of its public service. We have always been favoured with a public service which has acted in the most competent and professional manner and, therefore, the Australian public have justifiably had a great deal of confidence in that professionalism. They have come to rely on it in a way which is almost invisible. It is a very effective mechanism in this country which we inherited from the Westminster process of the United Kingdom and which has served this country particularly well.

         Therefore, it is very important, whenever we are examining potential changes to that framework, that we should give it the closest scrutiny. I know it is the government's intention that any aspect of this legislation should operate so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service and not in any way to derogate that. I think it is quite vital that, as members of parliament, whatever our political persuasion, we are mindful of the need to ensure accountability and openness in the public service and enhance the professionalism of that service.

         However, because of the size of Australia and the Australian government's operations, it is a very large and complex service and, because of the way in which government business is undertaken these days, that is necessarily the case. The Public Service has evolved considerably from the early days of its operation and, of course, it would not be practical to continue with the kinds of structures, policies and philosophies which underlay the Public Service at the time of Federation—or, indeed, which were inherited from the United Kingdom prior to that—into the 1990s, given the very dramatic and sweeping changes which have occurred to the administration of government since that time.

         Part of that process has also got to be directed towards an internal review of the mechanisms of the Public Service itself and a constant reassessment that those legislative frameworks are appropriate to the Public Service that we have today and the objectives which we would want to set as a government and as a parliament for that Public Service, as distinct from those which have pertained in the past and which, while they may have been relevant in those days, may well be less relevant today.

         Indeed, I think it is very instructive to look back at some of the comments which have been made about the Public Service over the years. On an historical basis, of course, the public has not always been kind to the Public Service in general, but I think that understates the contribution which that service makes and the manner in which it is required to do it.

         The Public Service has traditionally been required to act in a background mode, if you like, and not take an up-front role in a public sense. It is not meant to be part of a media campaign. It is meant to be a Public Service providing efficient and effective advice behind the scenes to governments in a way which will not detract from the operation of our democracy and that is quite a vital part of that process.

         If we examine the role of the public service over that period, commentators, even as far back as 1872, when dealing with the British public service of the day, could be quoted in lines such as `it is an inevitable defect that bureaucrats will care more for routine than for results'. Now, that kind of thing may have been true in the past, but it is something which we have to guarantee is not true in the current context. A similar commentator at that time observed:

        It is that kind of mentality, of over 100 years ago, which I think has often underlain public appreciation in recent decades for the Public Service. It is an image which the Public Service has successfully shaken off in recent times and one which I think this legislation will go some way towards enhancing, as will the review of the Public Service Act, which the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Mr Johns) has commissioned and which is under way now. The latest version of that bill, when it becomes available, will incorporate many of the kinds of changes which we would see as desirable.

         So how has the model of the Public Service changed since the days of those earlier quotations? Those models have had to adapt to changes in society and to our expectations of government and government service. Government now is much more democratic. The public is somewhat better educated than was the case a century or more ago when those quotations were applicable and, of course, people have much greater expectations of what the government will do.

         Much of that flows from the increased role of government, because the more government does, the more people will continue to expect from it. The greater availability of the mass media in promoting and explaining to the public, particularly at election times, the commitments that people make about the Public Service is very relevant to that process. It creates a climate of expectation, which obviously the public will expect to see reflected in the Public Service and the kinds of services it produces for it.

         In that period the public has come to expect that we will have a modern public service in which democracy, efficiency and equity are the kinds of underlying principles. They were the values of the late Dr Peter Wilenski, a very noted and prominent public servant in this country, who gave many years of service to his nation and is honoured in the Wilenski memorial lectures, which often revolve around Public Service oriented management topics. That is the kind of public service that he would have supported and did support in his time. I believe it is one which encapsulates the kinds of values which we would expect for our Public Service today.

         What we have also seen change over that period of time is the way in which program objectives and guidelines are much more clearly defined for the Public Service than they were in the past. In days when the role of the Public Service and that of the government were somewhat less than they are now, the programs were far less complex and public servants' areas of discretion would have been much reduced. Ministers were able to be accountable for the total range of actions of their public servants because the programs in contemplation were far less wide-ranging and far less complex, and the legislation which underpinned them was far more capable of comprehension than, sadly, it often is today.

         The situation that prevails in the 1990s is that, with the best will in the world, legislation is still very complex; it covers a wide variety of contingencies because of the potential of people to seek to evade some of its terms and the need to explain its terms in great detail. That has led to a situation where public servants are often placed in a position of having to take discretionary decisions, and the public of course has come to see them in some cases as decision makers rather than necessarily just decision takers from a minister who is actually accountable for the program.

         If we are able in the modern context to much more comprehensively set out program objectives and guidelines for the Public Service, we will to some extent reduce the uncertainty which public servants have in administering those programs and ensure that their personal preferences and priorities do not unnecessarily and unhelpfully intrude into that decision making process. It is essential that ministers decide and advisers advise, and that the way in which they do that is based on a very comprehensive outline of precisely what the policy is that the government would have them implement. It is also essential that the public understands that process to be one which is firmly based in efficiency, democracy and equity, as I said before.

         However, given the complexity of modern management, I do not think it is possible for us to expect that public servants will always be seen in a totally nonpartisan light unfortunately, because many of the decisions which they need to make are often translated into political and community decision making processes.

         If one looks at simple issues such as the opening times of a library, for example, that is often a decision taken by a public servant—be that at the local, state or federal level. Those issues about opening hours, simple service delivery questions, often become very political. Anyone who has served as I have in local government will know that issues like the opening times of libraries or the opening times of rubbish collection facilities and so on, all of those kinds of what we would see as very technical and public service management matters, can often take on a very political characteristic. It is one which now cannot be avoided, given the drive for efficiency and accountability in these processes.

         We should not allow that to sidetrack us from the need for efficiency and effectiveness. The House of Representatives expenditure committee—and I now have the honour to serve on the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration which has succeeded the expenditure committee—when it was looking at these kinds of issues as far back as l979, said that there seemed to be little point in having efficiently run programs which fail to effectively achieve the end results or the outputs that are desired.

         Even though the committee wrote about this as far back as 1979, it is a very timely reminder of the way in which we have to ensure that the purpose of government intervention in some aspects of the community's affairs is reflected not only in the legislation and in the program guidelines and models which government approves for the operation of the Public Service but also in the outcomes of the Public Service program—and in a way so that the public can appreciate, at the end of the day, that the outcome is a response to the drive for efficiency and democracy in their programs.

         Of course, one also has to include in the 1990s process the recognition of the need for an assessment of equity, because equity is something that we are all very conscious of now. In terms of the Public Service, though, when it was developed in the last century equity was seen only to mean a reference to treating all people equally: all before the law were equal and one did not favour one person over another in any way, shape or form.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Public Service has cultivated this ethic extremely well over the last 100 years and has done so almost to a fault, because, of course, ultimately society has come to recognise the need to ensure that equity goes beyond simply equal treatment. It means far more than this and, unless it means more than this, many of the objectives of government programs—the outputs about which I spoke a moment ago—will not be properly achieved. One has to relate very closely the outcomes that one seeks to achieve from a program to the equity objectives of the program because, while you can offer all programs identically to all people, the purpose of the government's intervention in the first place will not necessarily be achieved unless the focus is on the equity objectives of the program.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The modern interpretation of equity, of course, is to ensure that the approach which is administered by the program treats the needs and requirements of people equally so that those who have differing needs, requirements and abilities to benefit from programs receive the kind of assistance under the program that they need to benefit equally with others in that program. This is quite a different approach because it may not simply be the case that all members of the public can take advantage of a particular legal right that they may have without in some cases being given the benefit, for example, of legal aid in order to gain advantage from the program. The program will not achieve its equity objectives and its output objectives unless we have recourse to additional assistance for some members of the public to properly allow them to take part in the program.

         Unless we address this need we will not achieve the kinds of outcomes which we need for the Public Service. Along with the relatively minor changes which we are making to Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 today—but in contemplation of the other changes which will be made in the broader context of the Public Service review—we have to look at all these approaches.

         Given the extent of the Public Service in the modern climate, it is also very appropriate that we should examine the way in which the Public Service deals with equity on an internal basis as well as on an external basis.

         The taxpayers, of course, are demanding greater value from government these days and they are expecting it to achieve its internal processes in a much more efficient manner so that the public itself can benefit more from the available resources rather than see these at least partly consumed by internal processes. This is the kind of logic and ethic which has driven the efficiency dividend in recent years and it is one which will continue for some time to come. It is the need for internal efficiency and equity which drives the changes which we have before us today. Indeed, the bill which we are currently examining gives effect to the government's decision, announced in the 1995-1996 budget, to amalgamate the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission.

Any hint that we are departing from that process of merit selection and indulging in nepotism or favouritism of any kind would reflect very badly on the Public Service.

There have been many articles written about this and I am sure members present are aware of the matter. One of our major concerns is that the impartiality of the new Public Service and Merit Protection Commission is in no way jeopardised by political process.

         This leads to the questions that are yet to be answered about the entire way in which the Public Service is being administered. There have been recent comments about the effectiveness of the Public Service, and to my mind, and to the minds of many on this side of the House, that is really a reflection on the way in which this government has been handling the Public Service. In fact, it is a reflection on this government's attitude to the Public Service.

         This year's budget was very unclear—and it is even more unclear three months into the new financial year—about Public Service job losses. At the time, I think the figure of 4,000 public servant job losses was bandied around. The number of positions that were to disappear because of this year's budget was a great concern to people in my electorate.

I put questions on notice in late June to all the ministers and, as yet, I have not received a single response about this government's expected Public Service cuts for this financial year. It is absolutely extraordinary that, three months into a new financial year and five months past the budget date, we still do not know what this year's budget means to Public Service numbers. Is it that they do not know or that they are just not willing to say? Given the interest displayed in the bill by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), perhaps they could question the ministers responsible and assist me by getting an answer for my constituents.

         Where is the truth? We have numerous comments from those opposite about the Public Service and we are worried about the future of the Public Service in this city under another Keating government. There are no answers so far. A few months ago, I was asked to stand up for Canberra by Senator McMullan because of the rumours that departments and Public Service numbers would be cut under a John Howard government. The extraordinary thing is that Public Service numbers have been cut and Public Service numbers and bodies have been moved out of the ACT. This has not been done under the coalition. It has been done under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and under this Labor government.

         They have moved out in the term of this government. It is quite extraordinary when you look at the numbers of jobs that have been lost and the dozen or so public service bodies that have been removed from the ACT or, indeed, the bodies with national functions that perhaps should have come to the ACT. For example, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was moved to Sydney. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal went to Brisbane. The Industry Commission went to Melbourne. Australian Defence Industries went to Sydney. Australia Post's national stamp collection was moved to Melbourne. The CSIRO headquarters was moved to Melbourne. The National Aviation College went to Tasmania when reports suggested that it should have been in Canberra. Then there was the attempt to move the National Maritime Safety Authority out of Canberra to Newcastle, but the government backed down under pressure.

Yet what we have here is an obvious indication that it is the Labor Party that has been affecting the ACT.

         But there are other issues about the Public Service. Indeed, the former member for Canberra, when she came back to campaign—on her one and only outing—during the by-election, made the claim that if people voted for the Liberal Party, or if a Liberal Party member was returned for the seat of Canberra, the Liberal Party would clear-fell the ACT. What did the people of Canberra think about this little claim? They thought that was so reputable and they thought so highly of that comment that they produced the biggest by-election swing in 60 years. This is public servants voting for a Liberal candidate. If you have worked inside the Public Service and you know what is going on inside the Public Service, you will know that public servants are sick of the way they are being treated by this government.

It is interesting that the ALP and this Labor government so clearly paint themselves as champions of the Australian Public Service and of Canberra. But if you were to look at the development of Canberra since it was selected as the national capital site, the evidence would suggest that Canberra has benefited most under Liberal governments. In fact, the National Capital Development Commission was set up by the Menzies government and it was under Menzies and subsequent Liberal governments that the majority of government departments and public servants were moved to Canberra. And many of the capital's national attractions were built by Liberal governments.

         When confronted with Canberra's future, the centrepiece of this government's 1993 election cultural promises was the building of the National Museum of Australia. Yet, here we are, two years down the track, and we are yet to see a stick or stone cleared from the site and we are yet to see a brick laid. In this year's budget and the three-year forward estimates there is not a single dollar dedicated to the building of the National Museum of Australia.

The member for Canberra has not been around all that long, as is quite obvious from some of his comments not only today but also on previous occasions in the House, when he said that the public servants of Canberra have nothing to fear from a coalition government. I was in the public service when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and did we not have a lovely time then in the public sector! It was industrially unruly. Certainly in the history of the Public Service there were more industrial disputes in the period 1976 to 1983 than in any other period. That was because of the attitude of the Fraser government to the Public Service, which was far different from what we were led to believe by the member for Canberra a few moments ago.

         There was legislation such as the CE(RR) Act and the CEEP Act, which was very draconian legislation and took away basic industrial rights of public servants. I even recall—this is testing my memory—that the public sector unions, as they were at the time, did not have access to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. There was a separate public service arbitrator set up by the Fraser government which was very heavily loaded in favour of the government. Public servants and their unions could not even take industrial disputes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as it was then.

I managed to knock him over in the Promotions Appeal Committee, but I will come back to that. There were concerns about some of the changes that were made in the 1980s and there were concerns in 1986 when, under the streamlining provisions, access to the Promotions Appeal Committee was limited to fairly junior officers and up to middle management officers. In today's language, access was granted up to the level of ASO 6.

Discrimination is illegal on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, religion, age, marital status, pregnancy, social origin, ethnic origin and physical or mental disability. There is one other form of discrimination and it will come back to me in a minute. The words `mental disability' worry me a bit.

Whenever a promotion was up to a selection panel of Public Service managers in the department I never seemed to score a promotion, but, on a couple of occasions, I did manage to take the matter to the Promotions Appeal Committee—once, as I have described, on the basis of long-term higher duties, when I was passed over because the other person was more senior.

         The Promotions Appeal Committee was created by a Labor government—the Chifley government—back in the late 1940s. A fairly important point to remember is that this decision arose out of the sectarianism that dominated the Public Service in those days; it was rife. Depending on which department you were in, you either had to be a Catholic or a Mason to get promotion in the Public Service.

You would be in a department that was either a Mason stronghold or a Catholic stronghold, and you were usually looked after. If you were neither Catholic nor Mason, you were in a bit of trouble in the Public Service in those days. You also had to be a male, as I recall, to get on in the Public Service because, before 1949, women could not be promoted. They could not even get into what was then the third division until 1949. In fact, until 1966, if you were a female in the Public Service and you got married, that was no good.

         Certainly, there are times when you have to sack somebody if they have done the wrong thing, and there are also provisions in the Public Service now for people to be disciplined and eventually dismissed if they have done the wrong thing: if they have stolen or they have hit somebody or whatever. There are procedures to be gone through, and those procedures should also apply in the private sector. If somebody has done the wrong thing or, for whatever reason, an employer has fair and reasonable grounds to dismiss somebody, then they can do that. But I also think that there are plenty of times when that is not the case, and that people should have a right to be represented in a due process, and that is why we have the unfair dismissal legislation. It is also why in the public sector we have, and we need to have, the existence of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the merit principle enforced, as it is to a large extent because of the provisions of the Public Service Act, and section 33 in particular.

         —I will be very brief because most of the points that need to be made about the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 have already been made. This is a turbulent time in management in the public and private sectors. There has been a lot of debate about how to encourage the growth of efficiency whilst retaining humanity and effectiveness and an orientation towards meeting the goals of organisations. That kind of debate has occurred just as much in large private organisations as within public ones. I do not think the debate has, in any sense, concluded.

         There is a tendency for some people to say that the public sector should be treated in exactly the same way as the private sector. I question that. The goals of private organisations and public sector organisations, or the public service at least, are significantly different. The public sector is there to deliver goals, to serve the public, to make accessible the services that are best provided in common with the whole community and to do that in a way that ensures that they are accessible, equitably available and effectively and efficiently delivered. To a large extent the private sector overlaps with that but, of course, their bottom line is making a profit. In a sense, the goals are narrower. Equity does not have to be one of the goals of the private sector. Accessibility is important but it does not have to be a top priority in the way it does in the public sector.

         The public sector should, by definition, be working for the common good while private enterprise is working for shareholders, for management and employees and also for consumers. A good private enterprise will have a balance between those goals but that balance is not always as well achieved as it might be, any more than in the public sector the balance between efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility and equity are achieved as well as they ought be.

         It is important that we continue with this debate about how best to deliver public services. Some of the reforms that the government has introduced, including devolution to departments for responsibility for a lot of personnel management, will probably contribute to that but, given that the devolution has occurred, it is also important to have somebody that has the task of ensuring that departmental heads and senior officers administer their staff fairly and in a way that ensures that their rights are preserved.

         The Merit Protection and Review Agency is a very important element of doing that. It is there to provide an external appeal body which can be available to anyone who feels unfairly treated. It was very important that the agency be established. It does not matter greatly whether it stands by itself or as part of the Public Service Commission.

         It is ironic that, in the report on reform of the Public Service commissioned by the government, the proposal to combine the Merit Protection and Review Agency with the Public Service Commission was explicitly rejected and yet it has been decided to do it. Anyway, I do not think it matters greatly. The important point is that the chair of the Merit Protection and Review Agency retains her independence. That ensures that her tasks will be pursued with impartiality and a commitment to fairness and that the government will continue to fund the organisation effectively, therefore enabling it to do its work.

         It is very important as a guarantee, as a visible reminder to public servants, that they can appeal if they feel wronged in any way. The work of the agency, I know from the personal experience of constituents who have come to me, as I am sure the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) is also learning, is very valuable. It is very helpful to us to be able to refer them to the MPRA. It is also important that we have confidence that the MPRA does its work impartially and I have every confidence that it does.

         —in reply—I would like to close the debate by thanking those members who have taken part in it—the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans).

         It is a reasonably narrowly based debate but it has broadened out and it is important that I make some comment to rebut some arguments that are being given, especially by the members for Ryan and Canberra. The member for Ryan suggested that the McLeod report, which was an investigation established by me to be used for rewriting the Public Service Act, had somehow recommended against the amalgamation of the MPRA and the PSC. It did not recommend that. It had a preference for leaving those bodies apart but it did not recommend against amalgamation. But neither did the McLeod report—and this ought to be written down and remembered—have a brief on machinery of government matters. It did not have a brief to discuss whether there would or would not be amalgamations, which I call machinery of government matters.

         It was up to the government to make up its own mind on this, and it would have been anyway no matter what Mr McLeod had said. I get a little bit tired of people, having established reports and having them received by the government, then believing that somehow that report is written in stone and that the government needs to accept the findings. We sent people away to do a major exercise, the rewrite of the Public Service Act, with a major level of consultation, but governments not only reserve the right to make their own decisions in the end; they must do so.

         We are bound to make decisions about what we consider to be meritorious. We use reports that we have established to give us a guide, to give us a feel for the debate, but no more than that. However, having said that, of the 118 recommendations of the McLeod report, cabinet accepted 112 recommendations. It was a successful report in the sense that it reflected accurately the sorts of changes that needed to be made and in that the government concurred.

         A point made by the member for Ryan was that this may be an uncomfortable situation where the MPRA, which was seen to represent the interests of individual public servants, and the Public Service Commission, which is seen to represent the interest of management, the bosses, should somehow be housed in the one organisation. He does not understand that, with the changes over the last number of years and especially with the changes ensuing from our rewrite of the Public Service Act, the responsibilities for personnel management will rest fairly and squarely with departmental secretaries. The PSC is not an arm of management. The key decisions about the conduct, hiring practices and so on of public servants will be made within the law by heads of department. That ought to be made clear so that there is not even an implied conflict between the roles of the PSC and the MPRA.

         However, it seemed to me that great strengths would derive from the amalgamation. These are not large organisations—the MPRA especially—and although they have some outposts outside Canberra, it is very difficult for them to bring in any staffing power to those regional headquarters. Through the amalgamation we may have some strengthened regional presence under the new commission. I know that the amalgamating bodies are putting together their heads, and their resources, to ensure that the roles of the old PSC and the old MPRA can be delivered at regional centres outside Canberra. That is a strength that we hope will arise from the amalgamation.

         Another consideration was to ensure that the MPRA, which had been deciding particular cases, should be well informed on personnel policy, and that the PSC should learn from those cases when it comes to the question of drawing up policy. There had to be an intimate flow of material and understanding between the two groups. I think it was happening and it ought to happen now. The quality of that interaction will be improved somewhat by the amalgamation. The discussions about cooperation between the two groups are well advanced. I recently appointed Dr Peter Shergold to head the commission. He has been in discussions with Ms Ann Forward, the director of the MPRA, and they are getting on famously.

         I might also use this opportunity to thank Mr Dennis Ives, the former commissioner, whose five-year appointment came to an end recently.

         The other point was made by both the member for Ryan and the member for Canberra.

You do not have to trust us. It is in law. We are not affecting the powers—

I always had the view that the MPRA was a very small organisation hanging out there in the wind, and I would not mind betting that the coalition would have knocked it off, had they come to power. They have less regard for those sorts of matters. Over 12 1/2 years, we have consistently had a very high regard for the importance of individual public servants having access to an independent tribunal in order that their grievances could be heard, and this has been taking place since 1984.

         There are some other matters on the question of Public Service numbers, which I do not really need to address, but nevertheless they have been raised by the member for Canberra. The member for Canberra will remember that he asked me in the House, and he has written to me, about the impact on Public Service staffing as a result of the running costs program announced in the 1995-96 budget. The answer is in the budget papers, as you know, and published there—

         In fact, we said—as part of the drive for efficiency, not only in the public service but also in the private sector—that we would have to make considerable savings in the public sector as a result of the 1995-96 budget. So we had to tighten our belts too. But that goes to the question of running costs—not that of public servants, as such—so we can make only a reasonable prediction. As I say, the prediction we made has been published in those papers already. We would be happy to update it as we learn more.

        (2) Most items were raised in the context of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Human Rights Paper which serves to inform States and Territories about the Commonwealth in this area. With regard to the outcome of these agenda items, discussion of them in the Standing Committee is on-going. As far as the separate agenda items which relate to human rights are concerned, all States and Territories have agreed to legislate to specifically ban the practice of female genital mutilation. In relation to the International Transfer of Prisoners item model legislation is currently being drafted. Gender Reassignment was placed on the agenda by the Northern Territory. The item on treaties and the response to the decision in Teoh's case was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. With regard to the outcome of these latter 2 agenda items, as with Aboriginal Justice Issues, discussion of them in the Standing Committee is ongoing.
