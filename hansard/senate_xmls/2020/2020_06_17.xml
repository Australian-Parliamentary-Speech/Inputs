                </a>  I have been an acting deputy president myself for nearly five years. I was quite shocked and surprised to learn this morning that, during the adjournment debate last night—although two hours prior to it I had taken myself off the speaking list—Senator McGrath, in the chair, said, 'For those playing along at home, Senator Whish-Wilson has missed his spot, so, Senator Bragg, you now have the call.' I think it's totally inappropriate, firstly, for any acting deputy president to make those kinds of comments and to use that position to have a go at another senator, especially if they hadn't made inquiries as to why that senator wasn't on the list. So, President, could I ask you to take that on notice and seek a response from Senator McGrath and bring it back to the Senate chamber. I'd like this issue dealt with.</span>

However, I will indicate to the chamber that the crossbench, the Greens and the Labor Party are quite determined to deal with this particular issue. We have a regime in the Federal Register of Legislation whereby 1,119 companies are excluded from having to lodge annual reports to ASIC. That creates the potential for aggressive tax minimisation through opaqueness. It has to go. We cannot have a privileged class of companies in Australia, where there is one rule for certain companies with certain owners and another for all other companies.</span>

The bill seeks to change the definition of 'goods' in the act to include narcotic goods, which will support the legitimate export of narcotic goods, in alignment with foreign country import requirements. Labor unequivocally supports the bill. We think it is time for the government to harness the full potential of this crop. In the explanatory memorandum, the minister claims the amendment will 'remove unnecessary and unintended regulatory barriers on the trade of Australian hemp products'. We agree. Hemp is a product that is often misunderstood and misrepresented. Despite its low THC level, the full utilisation of this plant—including for medicinal purposes, local consumption, textiles, oil and exporting—has historically been prevented due to misinformation about its narcotic character. Labor encourages the growth and development of the hemp industry. It should be legal to ingest, cultivate and produce hemp products in all states in Australia. Hemp is an environmentally friendly crop. It provides opportunities for value adding an export growth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also time to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers to medicinal cannabis, starting with responding to the recommendations made by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. Australian agriculture has been hard hit by the protracted drought, bushfires and now COVID-19. At every step of the way, this government has failed to respond to the needs of the sector in a timely manner. Sadly, this is just another example of the government's failure to provide a strategic, well-informed plan for Australian agriculture.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers' Federation have put forward their vision to grow Australian agriculture to $100 billion in farmgate output by 2030. However, the NFF have made it clear that the Morrison government will need to play a central role by stepping up with developing a national strategy for agriculture. Farmers and regional communities are doing it tough and they are missing out on critical export opportunities, such as in hemp, because this government cannot get its act together.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previously mentioned, Labor supports the substance of this bill. But we urge this third-term government to stop taking for granted the resilience of our farmers and regional communities. Start developing a competency plan for agriculture that addresses long-term drought resilience and allows farmers to capitalise on emerging opportunities, through innovative solutions, to address future challenges that will impact the value of the sector.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I rise in support of the Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020. This bill removes barriers to Australian hemp and medicinal cannabis companies exporting their products to supply international markets. The Greens support this bill because we understand the many potential benefits of medicinal cannabis and we support a healthy Australian medicinal cannabis industry. But this bill also raises serious concerns about the domestic market. Since the Greens led the charge for the introduction of medicinal cannabis as far back as 2015, I've been highlighting the enormous barriers to patient access to medicinal cannabis in Australia. The TGA arrangements at present are failing to provide people with timely, cost-effective access. As a result of the problems within the current regulatory system, we undertook a detailed inquiry into the barriers and problems with regulation of medicinal cannabis in Australia. We did that earlier this year and the committee tabled its report in March. It's now essential that the government implement the recommendations of that report. At the end of my speech I'm going to be moving a second reading amendment to that effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important to understand the history here. The government made medicinal cannabis legal in 2015 and set up the regulatory framework through The Therapeutic Goods Administration. At that time we advocated very strongly that a separate, independent standalone regulator be established to allow people to access medicinal cannabis. That's the approach taken by many jurisdictions right across the world, recognising the very unique issues associated with a drug that in many circumstances has been prohibited for consumption and understanding also that medicinal cannabis is not one drug but indeed many different drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We decided to give the government the benefit of the doubt. It was a big change at the time. Up until 2015 it was illegal, full stop, for a doctor to prescribe a patient medicinal cannabis. But what we've seen now is that the system is failing people. In the five years that have now passed, what we've seen is people failing to get access to medicinal cannabis when they need it. The barriers are many and I'll go through some of them in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Affairs inquiry into patient access to medicinal cannabis uncovered a range of issues which advocates in the industry have been highlighting for many, many years. At the moment, if a doctor wants to prescribe a patient medicinal cannabis, they require the use of the Special Access Scheme through the TGA. This is important to understand. The TGA regulates products for approval here in Australia, but where there's a pharmaceutical drug that's from another jurisdiction, that hasn't yet entered the Australian market and hasn't been approved for use in Australia, there is a special provision called the Special Access Scheme that allows doctors to seek permission to prescribe that product. That's a scheme that was designed to be used in exceptional circumstances for drugs that may be of benefit to a limited number of people. The scheme was never intended to be used at scale for something like medicinal cannabis. It's remarkable—you've got the regulator, the TGA, that is designed specifically to regulate for the approval of pharmaceutical products, and they've been chosen to regulate a drug which bypasses their normal approval processes and uses something called the Special Access Scheme. As I said, what that scheme does is to allow for the prescription of products not yet approved for sale here in Australia, but it requires doctors to jump through a number of hoops in order to be able to prescribe it. It requires doctors to complete a detailed form every time, per patient, per script.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another way in which you can avoid having to go through that approval process for every specific script for a patient. You can become what is known as an authorised prescriber, but, again, the number of authorised prescribers has been extremely limited, and not only is the process for becoming an authorised prescriber onerous but also the committee found that the required approvals are really hard to come by. There are very few people who have been designated as having authorised prescriber status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just give a practical example. When I was in general practice, if a patient came in to see me I could write a script for an opiate. Opiates are drugs—codeine type drugs and other injectable preparations of opiates, like pethidine, for example. I can write a script for an opiate like codeine without requiring any approval from anywhere else. It's up to my discretion as a prescribing doctor as to whether I think the patient will benefit from an opiate. Now, we know from what is happening here in Australia—indeed, right around the world—that there is a crisis in overdose deaths from prescription opiates. In the US, tens of thousands of people are dying from prescription overdose deaths. I can do the same for benzodiazepine type drugs—I can write a script. And we know that, when it comes to the use of drugs like opiates and benzodiazepines, people do die when they are taken in large quantities. The potential for overdose is very real. I don't require any approval to be able to prescribe those drugs, and yet I have to jump through a range of hoops to prescribe a drug like medicinal cannabis, for which there has not been one documented case of overdose. When you talk about the relative safety of particular drugs, medicinal cannabis is safer than over-the-counter drugs like alcohol. We're trying to put a square peg into a round hole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues don't stop there. Doctors are struggling to get the necessary training and information they need to appropriately prescribe these products. Look, when I was training, we didn't even know there was an endocannabinoid system—it was something that just wasn't understood in medicine. We know now that medicinal cannabis products work because we have our own endogenous system, our own endocannabinoid system—our own body produces variations of these drugs itself, and that's why these products are effective. We didn't know about that only a short time ago. So the amount of information that doctors have on cannabis type products is very limited. Indeed, the only training I got was that cannabis is a dangerous drug and you need to ensure that people stay away from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you can find a doctor who's willing to undertake the paperwork and feels comfortable in prescribing, you're going to find red tape in accessing medication thanks to the overlapping regulation not just at a federal level through the TGA process but also at a state level. I'm sure we'll have a contribution later on where we hear about the huge problems in Tasmania specifically, where that state has decided to make it harder than any other state for someone to access medicinal cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you manage to go through the tangle of federal and state restrictions, patients are then going to be hit by the enormous cost associated with accessing these products because they're not subsidised—again, unlike other medications. So patients who need these treatments, who will benefit from them and who want to do the right thing continue to use the black market because they can get these products cheaply. Unfortunately they don't know what they're getting, it's an unregulated market and often what people think they're getting is not what they're purchasing, but they are being forced to break the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our inquiry included contributions from senators on all sides and made unanimous recommendations on how to urgently fix this failing system. These recommendations need to be the government's highest priority in this area. While we support our local industry accessing export markets, surely we should be looking after Australian patients first. Our committee has recommended that immediate changes be made to both the Special Access Scheme and the Authorised Prescriber Scheme to allow a smoother, simpler, more straightforward process for doctors. We recommend that investment be made by the government and by the colleges to ensure that appropriate doctor education is available so that people learn about the endocannabinoid system and the benefits of medicinal cannabis rather than the stigma that's currently associated with the use of these products. Crucially we recommend that the government investigate a compassionate subsidy scheme for medicinal cannabis so that patients are not faced with huge price tags just for accessing their medication. Right now, when people are given a script, they can be forced to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month simply to get access to a medication that would be of tremendous benefit to them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the committee we made a number of other recommendations, and I commend the report to all senators, but the key one is that the government moves forward to reform the system—that we establish an independent, stand-alone expert regulator for medicinal cannabis and move away from the TGA system, which is good for what it needs to do, but we are trying to put a square peg into a round hole. The report said very clearly that the government should reform the system if barriers to patient access persisted 12 months after tabling the report. Personally, I would've liked to have seen a stronger recommendation—immediate reform of the system—but, working across the divide with both Liberal and Labor senators, we accepted that the government be given 12 months to address the inadequacies of the regulation associated with medicinal cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that an independent regulator which understands many of the complexities associated with medicinal cannabis would allow for far greater patient access. That's experienced in many jurisdictions overseas. The irony of the current system is that, although the TGA is the pharmaceuticals regulator—it regulates the introduction of pharmaceutical products in Australia—most medicinal cannabis bypasses the normal regulatory framework within the TGA through the Special Access Scheme. So it circumvents the processes that are established within the TGA to regulate medicines. We have decided to use a regulator to regulate medicinal cannabis only to have it bypass their normal regulatory processes. It makes no sense, it's not sustainable and Australians deserve much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all these improvements to patient access would improve the viability of the Australian medicinal cannabis industry. This is a young market. It's just starting out and it wants to supply a domestic market, but the barriers are so high that despite knowing how many Australians are likely to benefit from these treatments there are only a trickle of prescriptions coming through. Yes, there has been incremental improvement over recent months, but it's coming off an extraordinarily low baseline and is still not enough to meet the extraordinary demand there is for medicinal cannabis progress. It's been estimated that millions of Australians would benefit from the use of medicinal cannabis or at least a trial of those products. At the moment, all we have is a few thousand Australians being able to access those products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our domestic market isn't enough to sustain a medicinal cannabis industry, and that's why the export market is important. As I've said, we do support that, but let's sort out our system here in Australia so that Australians can benefit from medicinal cannabis products. I have said on many occasions that this isn't a wonder drug. It doesn't have the benefits that some advocates purport, but it does have many, many potential benefits. You only need to talk to people who've experienced a remarkable improvement in their quality of life to know that this is a drug that Australians should be able to get access to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key issue for both industry and patient access domestically is the descheduling of CBD, one of the components of medicinal cannabis—and again it's important to understand here that THC is the drug with the psychoactive effect; CBD products don't have any psychoactive effects—and there's now a move to deschedule CBD-only products so that they can be accessed like other complementary medicines. Since the inquiry, the TGA has begun a progress to down-schedule small-quantity-CBD products, from schedule 4 to schedule 3, so they can be available over the counter at pharmacies, rather than requiring a prescription. It's a good start, but the issue remains that even schedule-3 CBD—which, as I said, has no capacity to create a so-called high; we know it's safe, we know it's well understood—would still require registration on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Drugs, requiring all the years of huge investment in clinical trials. Clinical trials are important, but they shouldn't be a barrier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we support the bill, but it's time we got on with fixing the situation at home so that Australians can access medicinal cannabis products here. I therefore move the following second reading amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">", but the Senate calls on the Government to urgently implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on its inquiry into current barriers to patient access to medicinal cannabis".</span>

However, this bill is specifically about export, and I think we need to deal with TGA matters through the appropriate regulations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of opportunities in the medicinal cannabis area—and I'd like to just put in a plug for my colleagues in the New South Wales parliament, who in 2016 moved to enable the use of medicinal cannabis; so it is truly a bipartisan acknowledgement that there is a lot to be said for medicinal cannabis—but today I want to talk about the Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reflects the ongoing support from our government, the National Party working with the Liberal Party, for Australian agriculture, because, at the end of the day, whether it is used for medicinal cannabis or industrial hemp, this is an agricultural product. I share the National Farmers Federation's ambitious goal to grow Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030—it's currently at $60 billion—and to do this we must look at two things: firstly, identifying emerging agricultural markets; and, secondly, ensuring that we in government do what we can to increase market access overseas. This bill recognises that legal narcotics such as medicinal cannabis and low-THC hemp are emerging markets, and we are easing restrictions so our producers can access those markets. Two-thirds of our traditional agricultural produce is exported. This legislation is designed to give our producers of legal narcotic products the same chance as we give to our wool-, beef- and wine-producing farmers, who enjoy the status of being leading Australian agricultural exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, markets in East and South-East Asia, as well as Europe, require government issued certification on plant exports, and that is fair enough. The amendment legislation we are debating today will allow our government to issue those certificates for our narcotic products—legal narcotic products. It will amend the Export Control Act and, in March 2021, will replace the 1982 act to ensure continuation. It is important to note that these changes only refer to legitimate narcotic goods, such as medicinal cannabis, and will not change other regulatory controls that we have in place on narcotics more broadly which we do not seek to produce, export or import. But, for our legal narcotics, we want to ensure that our growers are not at a competitive disadvantage in international markets, and this bill deals with that quickly and efficiently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation supports two key products that I want to talk about very briefly. Medicinal cannabis is a different product to marijuana—and our traditional view of it. It is a clear opportunity for a positive agricultural product—to grow cannabis plants under strict control orders and legislation. It is something the Morrison government, the coalition, strongly believes in, as shown by government's announcement last October of $3 million for the Medical Research Future Fund to examine the benefits of medicinal cannabis for pain or symptoms and side-effect management for cancer patients. Our government is committed to ensuring a safe, quality, regulated supply of medicinal cannabis to Australian patients, and this bill will enable the producers of that safe medicinal cannabis to access international markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also industrial hemp. This is a low-THC cannabis plant, the fibres and seeds of which are used for a variety of products. The use of low-THC cannabis as a useable fibre can be traced back some 50,000 years. Today it has multiple uses, including in paper, textiles, ropes, clothing and food for humans as well as animals. In fact, hemp seed is now claimed as a superfood in a lot of the trendy cafes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The potential for our farmers to compete in international markets is huge, and this bill will assist our Australian growers to participate in those markets. Allowing government certification will give such growers the best chance to export their product overseas. We all know our farmers make decisions on what to grow based on current demand, supplies, what is best for their on-farm business and where they can access markets, and that's what this bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011-12 the gross value of Australian hemp production was around $300,000—over an estimated 185 hectares of plantation. In November 2017 the Australian food standards code was amended to permit the sale of low-THC hemp seed for food consumption, which has seen a small increase in hemp production. This bill will further raise the opportunities. Due to the perceived health benefits of hemp seed and the like, as well as traditional and novel uses for hemp fibre, which now include being used for biodegradable plastics, it should be no surprise that there is perceived to be a global increase in industrial hemp demand, making it an emerging market both domestically and internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The certification of Australian industrial hemp and now medicinal cannabis by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment will give many countries the assurance required to import our produce, and we all know Australia is very highly regarded internationally for its agricultural produce. Our government supports this because we believe in Australian agriculture, we believe in the Australian farmer and we believe in regional and rural Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are talking about an emerging agricultural market which will continue to grow, and it would be remiss of us not to enable our farmers to have full access to those markets. When you increase exports you increase the incomes of farmers and strengthen the economies of regional and rural Australia, and that is what this legislation is designed to do. Agriculture in Australia has always been ambitious and innovative. This legislation reflects that ambition and recognises this increasing market as an opportunity. We have a tremendous reputation for our produce both in the amount we produce—three times more than we consume—and in the quality. There is no reason why that reputation can't extend to our production of legal narcotics, and I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  The Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020 is another example of the commitment One Nation and I made to the Australian people that we would pursue changes in our laws to unwind the stranglehold on the cannabis industry. I need to pay respect to Senators Cormann and Kitching for their combined efforts to assist me in making this bill pass the parliament. My office reached out to the minister for agriculture, who is also the Deputy Leader of the National Party, David Littleproud. Minister Littleproud originally had no interest in making this bill come before the parliament, even though market standards predict global industry hemp demand is projected to grow from $4.6 billion to $26.6 billion over the next five years. I was listening to Senator Davey's comment that they're really interested in growing the agricultural industry in Australia, and again David Littleproud made a comment. The dairy industry is still dying. Over 500 more dairy farmers went last year. So, when it comes to pushing for the agricultural industry, I don't think Mr Littleproud is up to the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Littleproud showed zero interest or foresight into the very real fact that the future hemp industry could very well act as a transition crop for struggling cane farmers in Queensland, including North Queensland, where sugar millers are squeezing them out of the market. When Mr Littleproud refused to deal with this bill in a timely manner, I went to Minister Cormann's office, and it was he and Senator Kitching—a Labor senator, and I thank her very much—who brought both the Liberal and Labor parties together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen the benefits this crop offers to food, fibre and medicines. I want to acknowledge the countless health-food stores who've been pushing the benefits of this crop, but I also want to acknowledge Woolworths, who have recently taken on Australian-made products, including hemp seed and hemp oil. I'm aware of Australian dog food companies who are looking to implement plant based substitutes like hemp, which is high in fibre. I also want to recognise the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, which operates within Sydney university and whose use of cannabis to treat epilepsy will be recognised tonight with a virtual award for their efforts in assisting the many Australians who suffer these debilitating fits. Researcher Dr Lyndsey Anderson, an American attracted to Australia to work at the Lambert initiative, is being internationally recognised for her work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an enormous way to go in making medicinal cannabis more readily available for patients across this country. But today's passing of this bill is another shuffle in the right direction in assisting the cannabis industry. I will be encouraging farmers nationwide to get on board with the cannabis industry, and I will be ensuring, after the next Queensland election, that One Nation remove the barriers that have been put in the way of growing hemp as a food and fibre product. I not only welcome the passage of this bill but am very pleased to have instigated the change we're legislating here today.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  The Morrison government is very much committed to finding ways to continue to grow our agricultural sector, and AgriFutures, whose research is so very important to planning out policy in this area, have noted the potential future for the growth of the industrial hemp market worldwide. They've said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a great opportunity for Australian growers to capitalise on growth of current and future products derived from industrial hemp with Global Market Insights predicting the market to surpass US$270 million in size globally, by 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most countries currently regulate unprocessed and semiprocessed plant products against the introduction of injurious plants, pests and diseases, but, up until recently, we've had some difficulties in being able to access some of those international markets that Australian growers might like to reach. This bill, the Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020, ensures that there is the kind of legislative coverage needed to enable government certification for goods of this kind so that Australian growers have international market access. That means that we are complying with international agreements around this, like the International Plant Protection Convention, and it means that a problem faced at present, where the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment aren't able to issue government certificates to support the legitimate export of these goods, can be fixed so that those sorts of certifications can readily and easily be provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say this bill led me down a path of having to make some inquiries, because I'm on the record as being somebody who is antidrugs, in the narcotics sense, in every possible way. I'm always conscious of ways that we can reduce Australian people's use of harmful drugs. Despite the fact that there are some people out in the community who think drugs like marijuana are harmless, I think very differently, and I think that, once we start to tally up a lot of the mental and social costs associated with what some people pretend is harmless, it is exposed as nothing of the sort. But the inquiry I was led to by this bill was to find out precisely what kinds of things we were talking about under the heading of low-THC goods, low-THC hemp and medicinal cannabis products. I found it quite informative. I learned that the low-THC hemp, which is the subject of this bill, is a plant that's got 0.3 per cent or less of THC, which is the part of marijuana that gets a person high, so it's not a product that poses any kind of drug type risk. In fact, it's a really important agricultural product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hemp seed—of course, the variety that doesn't have those potentially harmful drug-like attributes—when hulled and unable to germinate, is a food product that is used by many. Again, I'm assured that it is not something that's harmful at all. I found the other uses for the hemp plant pretty interesting too. It's a really important fibre that is used in the production of fabrics and textiles, and those fabric, textile and food uses can provide a great opportunity for Australian farmers to diversify the crops they grow so that they are more resilient for different environmental and market circumstances. Anything that gives agricultural communities more of the choice and flexibility they need to be viable has to be a good thing. Medicinal cannabis in this country is heavily regulated but legal. While I'm not an enthusiast for it, the very tight controls that we have around it in this country are maintained by this bill. In circumstances where that is legal here and legal in other places, there's not really much of a reason why we should stop high-quality Australian farmers from being able to access those important markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend the bill to the Senate. I think it is an important measure that we can implement to create better market access for Australian producers. Every thing we can do to ensure their ability to be viable, their ability to contribute to our economy, their ability to employ and their ability to continue to invest in the communities in which they grow has to be a good thing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I'm delighted to say that this bill, the Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020, holds enormous promise. For far too long, cannabis and hemp have been suppressed for reasons that have everything to do with established interests and nothing to do with the merits of the plant. That has hurt people for years and is hurting hundreds of thousands of people now. This bill addresses one area that has been holding back the Australian cannabis and hemp industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there is no formal system for providing approvals for the export of medical cannabis and hemp. The producer must apply to the minister for an ad hoc approval. While approvals have been granted, the volumes are a fraction of the potential that this crop offers. The Export Control Act 2020 came in this year and allows the minister to make rules that govern the issue of export certificates. If a substance is on the list, rules are issued to regulate the export of that substance. Cannabis and hemp were not included in that act. This amendment corrects that. Cannabis and hemp growers and manufacturers can now have certainty about the rules for export. Every grower is on the same footing. All who meet the rules can get an export licence and sell product into the world market, and what a market that is. The cannabis and hemp market in Australia is expected to grow to a billion dollars in just four years and double that to $2 billion by 2028. At that time the Asian market, our near neighbours in Asia, will exceed $10 billion. This is the start of a wonderful opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's reputation as a high-quality, safe supplier of food and medicine will help our producers take a significant share of that huge market. I must compliment the government on its decision to require all cannabis producers to follow the international safety and quality standard known as the GMP—good manufacturing practice. Quality processing has been instrumental in growing our reputation for trusted product, and that means a lot to people overseas and in Australia. Internationally, the world market for cannabis and hemp is expected to reach $50 billion by 2030. Some of this growth is from the trend to legalise recreational cannabis, which, I need to make clear, One Nation does not support. We do support natural Australian whole-plant medical cannabis by way of doctors prescription to any person with a medical need supplied by pharmacist and subsidised on the PBS. I note that the government is also looking to reschedule low-THC cannabis into schedule 3 as an over-the-counter chemist-only medication. One Nation supports that rescheduling. We have long pushed for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government talks about market efficiency, but in the cannabis market we have nothing but overregulation and disincentives to enter the market. This bill will help, but there is much, much more to be done. I draw the government's attention to the review of the Narcotic Drugs Act conducted by Professor McMillan, which reported almost 12 months ago, in July 2019. Professor McMillan made 26 recommendations to improve the commercial efficiency of the cannabis market in Australia. None of those recommendations have been implemented. Many of those recommendations dovetail nicely with the intent of the export control legislation amendment to develop an Australian export industry for cannabis and hemp. The report calls for a reduction in the onerous conditions being applied to the industry and to people who work in it. These restrictions are an unnecessary and costly barrier to efficient, quality production. They're holding our farmers back. They're holding everyone in the supply chain back. They're holding customers back. Professor McMillan has recommended that a single licence be issued for all or some of cultivation, production, manufacture and research, instead of the individual licences currently being required at each step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also suggested licences be valid for five years rather than 12 months. Most exported cannabis and hemp is value-added. Allowing one producer to now grow, process, manufacture and research new products on a five-year licence guarantees the security of their investment, which improves the return on their investment. By encouraging vertical integration, our producers can benefit from multiple profit centres and insulate against fluctuations in one area of this emerging market. Export opportunities will be enhanced by a wider range of products offered for sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Volume and diversity resulting from export markets will benefit domestic patients as well. Let me explain. Currently, medical cannabis is prohibitively expensive. This is in part due to the high administrative, regulatory and security costs imposed on each stage of the process, from cultivating or importing through to selling the product to a patient. This high cost is spread across low volumes because of restricted access, making each prescription too expensive for patients to afford. That creates an ongoing cycle of high prices and low affordability, leading to low volume, which leads to high prices. It's a vicious cycle. This bill represents a way out of that self-defeating cycle by allowing for the current small domestic demand to be met through high-volume, low-cost export production. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best medical cannabis is produced from plants that have been processed as little as possible. It is a wonderful, natural product. Conversion into vaping solutions, patches, topicals and capsules does not disturb the compound profile of the plant. It is a wonderful product. As medical cannabis has been legal for many years in most nations on the planet, we are seeing an explosion of new varieties of medical strains of cannabis. I have seen some of them myself. These have been developed to provide the optimum profile for a specific medical condition. This wonderful plant, in its many varieties, can be tailored to the specific needs of patients, and there are many patients in desperate need of this. Hundreds of different varieties are now available to the world market—hundreds. The more of these varieties that can be grown in Australia to support export demand, the greater the variety available to supply domestic patients will be. People can have this marvellous natural plant tailored to suit their specific medical needs. With a professional, efficient and profitable export industry, Australian patients will be able to access the exact cannabis profile for their particular health condition at much reduced prices and for much greater value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator from Queensland, I'm excited that we have a growing centre for cannabis excellence in Southport. Our beautiful climate is perfectly suited to growing hemp for food, textiles, cosmetics, oil, building products and so much more. Queensland will be on the forefront of this multibillion-dollar export industry for both hemp and cannabis. One Nation's policy of restoring property rights to farmers and building more dams will deliver to our farmers the capacity to grow Australia's agricultural capacity through hemp and cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before closing, I want to reiterate what our party leader, Senator Hanson, said and express my thanks to Senator Cormann from the Liberal Party and Senator Kitching from the Labor Party. It was them who made it possible. Senator Hanson and some of our staff have been pushing for this for years, vigorously, and it is wonderful to see this step. Tiny though it is, it is a wonderful step, so thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, may I suggest that the success of this bill will depend upon what the export rules for cannabis are. To date, rules on medical cannabis and hemp have been so damn onerous that people have been left wondering if the government is fair dinkum about a plant that has so many proven applications and also so many successful runs on the board overseas. We look forward to the government proving, through fair and effective regulation, that they are indeed genuine about implementing this bill's intention. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  The Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020 is required to amend parts of the export control legislation. The bill will amend the definition of 'goods' contained within the Export Control Act 1982 and the Export Control Act 2020. The amendments will remove discrepancies in the treatment of narcotic goods with other goods that pose a similar risk to Australia's trade reputation and market access.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Markets for industrial hemp in Australia are underdeveloped by comparison to other OECD countries, especially Europe, the UK and Canada. The past 15 years have seen significant global innovation, significant levels of research into agronomy and the development of high-performance hemp products. AgriFutures has noted the potential for future growth of the industrial hemp market worldwide, stating:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a great opportunity for Australian growers to capitalise on growth of current and future products derived from industrial hemp with Global Market Insights predicting the market to surpass US$270 million in size globally, by 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most countries currently regulate unprocessed and semiprocessed plant products against the introduction of injurious plants, pests and diseases. Under international plant protection conventions, exporters and countries can issue phytosanitary certificates attesting to the absence of such pests and diseases on exported plant products, which is what this bill seeks to facilitate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2015, in place of phytosanitary certificates, alternative assurances have been provided for cannabis products exported to markets in Korea, the United States, Uruguay and New Zealand. Earlier this year an exporter from Queensland sought to export a commercial quantity of seed to the United States. The US Department of Agriculture indicated they would require formal phytosanitary certification from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment for exports to be accepted. Since late 2019 exporters have expressed interest in exporting to other markets, including Thailand, Vietnam and Canada. These are all markets that require official phytosanitary certification—certification that the passage of this bill will finally allow Australian authorities to issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendment will allow Australian exporters to meet the biosecurity import requirements for any market that requires a phytosanitary certificate. Countries that currently have strict import requirements including phytosanitary certificates for unprocessed plant products include China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Canada and the US. In fact, the only major markets that don't have such requirements are Hong Kong and Singapore. This bill will address the government's current inability to issue phytosanitary certificates and enable certification of a broad range of agricultural commodities, including narcotic goods within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901. The bill will ensure Australia meets its obligations under international agreements and provides assurances to trading partners that our exported agricultural goods meet their requirements. The bill provides the confidence for existing and future exporters to pursue lucrative export opportunities, particularly for those involved with new and emerging industries. Being able to access a broad range of markets creates more export opportunities and higher profits for Australian farmers, producers and export businesses. The bill will support initiatives of the government to congestion-bust in regulation and ensure the agricultural industries come out firing after the threat of COVID-19 has passed. Without the ability for government to provide this certification, Australian exporters are at a disadvantage when compared to global competitors. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This omnibus Bill includes a series of tax measures including a measure to amend the hybrid mismatch rules, continuing the Morrison Government's work on combating multinational tax avoidance, while ensuring that compliance burdens are kept to a minimum. The Bill also allows employers to report information already required for child support under Single Touch Payroll, further streamlining employer reporting to Government. The Bill establishes a deductible gift recipient general category for men's sheds and women's sheds and includes a number of other organisations on the list of deductible gift recipients. The Bill also includes a measure providing funding for Australia's continued financial support of the World Bank. Finally, this Bill will also allow the ATO to share critical JobKeeper-related information with the Fair Work Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure employers comply with the scheme. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 2) Bill 2020 on behalf of the opposition. At the outset, I will confirm that the opposition will be supporting this bill. This bill contains six schedules relating to various aspects of Treasury legislation. The measures contained in the bill are technical and non-controversial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill amends the hybrid mismatch rules in the Income Assessment Act 1997. 'Amends' is perhaps a generous assessment of this measure. The measure clarifies certain aspects and is expected to have a minor, unquantifiable revenue impact over the forward estimates period. We've heard the government make strong claims about how much they are doing to combat multinational tax avoidance, but you have to laugh when the strongest measure they've brought forward this year is a few minor typo corrections and clarifications in the more obscure chapters of the Income Tax Administration Act 1997. The government must urgently act to end multinational tax avoidance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill allows the Single Touch Payroll system to include employer withholding of child support deductions from salary and wages. This measure will further streamline and simplify our child support and family law system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 amends the designated gift recipient rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include a new category for community sheds. This means that men's and women's sheds across the country will now be eligible to receive tax-deductible gifts. There are now more than 1,200 men's and women's sheds across Australia. These sheds are doing vital work, building connections and communities. This work is more important now than ever before as our community recovers and rebuilds following the coronavirus pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill amends the International Finance Corporations Act 1955 and International Monetary Agreements Act 1947, to allow the government to meet obligations to the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation that they have under this bill. These measures support the provision of financial assistance and advisory services to middle- and low-income countries. Of course, Labor supports them. Labor will continue to offer the government bipartisan support for Australia's participation in important global institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of the bill adds a number of specified designated gift recipients to the broader list of specified designated gift recipients. Labor welcomes the inclusion of the Superannuation Consumers' Centre and welcomes their advocacy of the interests of ordinary Australians in the superannuation sector. I'm glad that we're now hearing more from people who represent the interests of ordinary Australians in the super sector, whether the union movement or the consumer movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 provides for the Australian tax office to share information on JobKeeper payments with the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Fair Work Commission. This will allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to better address JobKeeper related compliance issues, particularly where employers are rorting the system and pocketing funds. We welcome the government's decision to allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to do their job here, but we would encourage the government to go further. I'm speaking about the $6 billion in superannuation guarantee levy payments that are rightfully earned by Australian workers but snatched away by their employers to fatten their own profit margins. The Fair Work Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman could be part of that solution, and yet at this point these bodies do not have the powers or the information necessary to tackle the problem of superannuation theft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike minimum wages, sick leave, annual leave or parental leave, the universal right to superannuation is not included in the National Employment Standards. This means that ordinary workers are powerless to pursue super theft claims through the Fair Work Commission and means that the Fair Work Ombudsman is toothless in the face of this $6 billion problem. This means that workers are powerless to organise through their union to take action through the Fair Work Commission to stop having their superannuation stolen by their employer, and this is not good enough. While we welcome and support the government's decision to allow these bodies to access information relating to JobKeeper and appropriately enforce compliance around this measure, we do call on the government to act to end superannuation theft and to give the Fair Work Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman the powers that they need to do so. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  The Greens are particularly interested in schedule 6 of this bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 2) Bill 2020. Essentially it's an omnibus bill that includes six different legislative instruments, but we're particularly interested in schedule 6. The reason is pretty simple. We in the Greens fought hard to get JobKeeper during the COVID crisis that we've all been through in recent months. Indeed, I think the Greens were the first ones to raise the issue of the need for a living wage during this pandemic. We raised the fact that countries like the UK and New Zealand were considering a living wage, and that, while we applauded it—especially Senator Siewert, after all her fantastic work in recent years to increase Newstart, which has essentially become jobseeker—we felt that it didn't go far enough. We actually needed to provide certainty for workers and businesses to stay in business during this most unprecedented crisis that we've found ourselves in. It is simply to give confidence to families, to workers and to business owners and even to consumers and the economy, which is what we need to do in times of pandemic. We've learnt enough from history to know the most important thing we can do in times of crisis is inject confidence into the economy. We learnt that from the GFC and we've learnt that from other crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We got JobKeeper. Let me just say a few brief words about the background of JobKeeper. It wasn't just the Greens and the Labor Party and others who were actively out there saying that we needed a living wage in the form of something like JobKeeper. I understand that the reason the government finally came to the party and legislated a living wage like JobKeeper is that the business community itself, along with the unions, the ACTU—and the role that Sally McManus and others played in negotiating the JobKeeper package with the business community has been well publicised—recognised the need to keep businesses open and to keep continuity in place. They also recognised the fact that many small business owners especially—and that is what JobKeeper was firmly aimed at, small businesses—didn't feel comfortable about joining and were unlikely to go down and join the long queues outside Centrelink. So we got JobKeeper, and I think it was a fantastic collaborative effort both by people within this parliament and by many, many stakeholders outside the parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't been perfect. The Greens have been on the COVID-19 committee inquiry and we've been continually asking questions about some of the failings of JobKeeper. It is a gigantic effort to pull something like this together at short notice, and I put on record the Greens' thanks to all the hardworking public servants, especially the Treasury officials, those at the Australian Taxation Office and others, who have literally worked around the clock to make sure that we have this payment to keep small businesses ticking and to give money to workers and give them confidence. But it did leave out huge cohorts in this country, such as casual workers who have been employed for less than 12 months; and those on foreign worker visas, who are absolutely critical. In my state of Tasmania we especially need foreign workers in many of our agriculture industries and tourism industries. So it hasn't been perfect. The Greens have continually pushed for extra payments to the disability support sector, to the arts sector and indeed to the university sector and so on, and we're not taking our foot off the brake in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we've discovered in recent weeks is that there are a number of glaring omissions that have raised their heads and need to be fixed, and one of them is about the government's one-in all-in rule, which basically said to employers, 'If you are going to put any employees on JobKeeper, you must put all your employees on JobKeeper.' Remember that employers, yes, had to fund the first four to five weeks of this payment, but then they would be refunded. That has definitely been an issue for many small businesses, particularly if they have dozens of employees; that was potentially $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 they had to come up with at short notice. And, for those not following this debate, there was pressure put on the banks to provide low-interest loans and 'interest holidays' on existing loans, to do whatever they could, to help small businesses meet that gap. I moved an amendment to the original legislation many weeks ago to bring that payment date forward to make sure small businesses weren't put under that pressure. Nevertheless, that's no excuse for employers in this country, when they're being given money by the government—it's not their money; these are public funds, a stimulus payment to their workers, to keep confidence in the economy, to keep food on the table, to keep their businesses going—to cherry-pick who gets JobKeeper and who doesn't. If you are eligible—and I'll get to that point in a minute, because it's very important—the law as it stands says, if you pay one employee, you must pay them all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know that many businesses, sadly, have not adhered to the one-in all-in rule. I accept there has been some confusion in terms of dealing with accountants around this. The rules and the goal posts have been changing a lot. The situation is very fluid. It has been a difficult time. But the one-in all-in principle is very simple, and it's there for a reason. This is a government stimulus payment to keep confidence in the economy, provided by the Australian taxpayer, the public. I know that Fair Work are dealing with thousands of complaints from employees who have been left out of JobKeeper. They've been told by their employer, 'Sorry. Joe and Jane got it, but I haven't been able to sign you up for it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone very close to me has been going through exactly this situation. They contacted Fair Work and said, 'Four of my fellow employees received it, three of us haven't, and our employer has provided no explanation apart from that he got it late or he didn't see it when you sent it through, and so on and so forth—all the excuses in the world'. Fair work said: 'You are entitled to this. Your employer needs to sign you up to it. It is the law.' Then Fair Work contacted them again and said, 'Look, we feel sorry for you, but there is nothing we can do to enforce this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raised this issue in the COVID inquiry directly with the Australian tax office and directly with Treasury. As it turns out, while we have this rule in place, there are no enforcement powers in the legislation. There are no enforcement powers at all. Fair Work has been telling employees who have missed out—many of whom have severe anxiety and don't have the money to pay their rent and get through this—that it can't help them until this parliament legislates enforcement powers so Fair Work can go after these employers. When the tax office answered my question, it was quite interesting. I have a lot of time for Mr Hirschhorn and have worked with him now for many years. He said, 'Look, our first port of call is to have a discussion with the employer and say, "Why aren't you putting these workers on JobKeeper?" and try to sort it out at that point.' Mr Hirschhorn's view was that it's in no-one's interest for the employer to be fined. I understand where Mr Hirschhorn is coming from, but it's easy for him to say that. He's not the one missing out on getting a payment when he needs it. That's not a slur against Mr Hirschhorn at all, but I fundamentally disagree. I think there has to be a stick-and-carrot approach. If the carrot doesn't work—there are, sadly, dodgy employers out there—there needs to be a stick. Fair Work needs the information from the tax office and it needs the power to enforce this rule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know how much longer this scheme will go on. The government introduced, unfortunately, significant uncertainty into the equation again by saying that JobKeeper will be reviewed in June, after employers and employees had been told they would get it until September. The government suddenly took it away from the childcare sector 10 days ago at short notice. So the whole point of introducing confidence into the system by providing a stimulus payment is being eroded by this government's rush to pull the rug out from under the feet of employers and employees in this country. There is this idea that somehow the economy will snap back, but we're all very worried that we're facing a fiscal cliff and that, when these payments are withdrawn, we will have significant pain and hardship on our hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' view is that this payment should be extended, and it should certainly be extended to those unfortunate Australians who have been left out by this government. But let's fix the law as it is before us now, especially schedule 6 in this bill, which relates to the one-in, all-in rule. I understand that a second reading amendment has been circulated in the chamber on behalf of me and the Australian Greens. I move:</span>

To my colleagues across the chamber: in the spirit in which you introduced JobKeeper—and thank you for doing that; thank you for working with all stakeholders and bringing in a living wage—let me also remind you that what has been seen can't be unseen. Government stepping in and keeping businesses going is a good thing when it's needed. We would like to see this concept extended way beyond COVID to look at a permanent living wage. We think it's very important that government plays a strong role in our lives. The Greens have always argued for a strong role.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">May I remind the minister, while I'm on my feet, that, in a recovery phase, the government also has a strong role to play by investing in the community: investing in infrastructure projects that will build this country; investing in transitioning to 100 per cent renewable energy in this country; providing job security for young Australians, who, by Jove, have had a difficult few years. If you're a young Australian now, you've been told to stay at home for three months and not go out. You've seen a summer of horrendous bushfires, with Australians being evacuated from beaches; record droughts; the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, with a third mass coral bleaching in our oceans. You surely must be wondering what the future holds for you. It's our job as government to give them that certainty—for the next generation, not just for the next few weeks or the next month through the JobKeeper scheme. Our role is to take that concept and provide a future and security for young Australians—something that they can feel that they are being supported on. So we need to take these principles that we've all applied in recent weeks and months, which have been great, and now extend them to the future. No more austerity. No more zombie budget cuts. Let's have a strong role of government in our lives. The Greens will be supporting— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This amendment seeks to remove from the statutes an exemption for 1,119 large proprietary companies from having to lodge an annual return with ASIC. That exemption creates a situation where there is scope for aggressive tax minimisation. That is what was presented to the Senate committee inquiring into corporate tax avoidance in the 44th and 45th parliaments. It also creates a situation where you have one class of companies and another class of companies. Any new company that comes along that meets the criteria for annual reports doesn't get an exemption. We can't have a situation where we have elite, wealthy business owners simply not having to lodge annual reports.</span>

There is no justification for retaining this exemption. It was an exemption that was introduced back in 1995 as a temporary measure. Twenty-five years later it is still in the statutes. We know from the previous discussion on this last week that the government has no policy reason, other than it is still considering the 2015 report, for in fact not supporting this amendment. I will keep it brief: I will ask the minister whether or not he can present a policy reason for retaining this exemption.</span>

The government will respond to this recommendation in due course as part of its response to the Senate economic committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporate tax avoidance</span> reports.

There's a part of me that feels for Senator Seselja, having to give an answer like that—not wanting to rush something through that was recommended five years ago and then confirmed three years ago. I imagine the government's focus on this issue might become more urgent as this amendment gets repeatedly put on these bills, as Senator Patrick has indicated he's intending to do. We do believe that this amendment is worthwhile. We think it's sensible. It increases transparency and consistency in the corporate law system. The private companies on this list, many owned by Australia's richest and most powerful individuals, are benefiting from an unfair and out-of-date grandfathering regime. We do believe this amendment increases accountability for large proprietary companies. We have supported this amendment in previous bills and we support it today. I think, if anything, it's going to make the government take this issue more seriously than it perhaps has over the past five years.</span>

We introduced this exact same amendment two years ago. At the time we worked with the Labor Party and the crossbench to try and remove grandfathering exemptions for some of the most wealthy individuals and biggest companies in this country from providing their financial reports to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Transparency should be in our genes. We can't fix a system until we actually see the problem. There is no excuse from a public policy point of view. I'm glad that Senator Patrick has put the same question to Senator Seselja that he put to Senator Hume: what is the public policy purpose of providing an exemption from providing accounts so that they can be publicly scrutinised? I haven't seen a good response to that question. I think the Australian public are watching this debate and will continue to watch this debate and look out for your policy response on this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to take a point that Senator Seselja made, because it is a good point. This chamber, indeed this parliament, has worked on tax transparency. We have passed some really important legislation, working together, across party lines. Senator Hume was very keen to speak in detail about the multinational tax avoidance law on Monday. She was filibustering out the debate, but nevertheless it was a very good point that she made and I was glad she made it. We have done some really good stuff together in this chamber. The fact that this anomaly sits there and has not been tackled by this chamber stands out like Chopper Read at a Country Women's Association morning tea. The more good work we do, the more it looks like a stupid anomaly that we haven't actually removed this.</span>

Nevertheless, I make this point: we have the ability today to pass this legislation and also to remove the grandfathering exemptions, exemptions that were brought in over 20 years ago by the Keating government and locked in by the Howard government. We have repeatedly raised this issue. It's been raised in numerous Senate inquiries. It's been raised by the Australian tax office at estimates and so on and so forth. There's no excuse for keeping Australians in the dark in terms of the financial matters of these big companies. Let's do it today. Let's get it out of the way and then let's get on with our business.</span>

Over a thousand of these companies, since this grandfathering was put in place over 20 years ago, have donated more than $20 million to the Liberal Party. Pratt Holdings is one of those companies. Since that time, it has donated over $5 million to the Liberal Party. Minister, can you assure the Australian public that these donations have absolutely nothing—nothing whatsoever—to do with the reason you want to leave this grandfathering in place?</span>

As Senator Gallagher said, I will be putting this amendment on every Treasury bill that it is possible to put it on. I point out that this is not an inappropriate bill to put it on. It's an omnibus bill, and I'm simply adding in a measure to close a loophole. I was speaking with someone on your side of the chamber yesterday. I won't identify that person, but they said, 'We have to recognise that, on this one, we're pregnant.' Why don't you just have the baby?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  The Greens are particularly interested in focusing, in my contribution today in the second reading debate, and also in the committee stage, on the bill's implications for defined benefit schemes and what that means to employees at Australian universities. The amendment under consideration today applies very narrowly to defined benefit schemes currently admitting new members. I understand that there are very few defined benefit schemes still open and admitting new members. This Senate has dealt previously with schemes in relation to Public Service and especially military personnel. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Superannuation, Your Choice) Bill 2019 has very serious implications for at least one of these schemes, which is UniSuper, who made a number of submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. While this amendment has narrow application, I should point out an inconsistency in that other defined benefit schemes provided by the Commonwealth, states and territories are not exposed to the same risks. Section 15 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Regulations 2018 already carves out government schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without this amendment, from what I know about adverse selection, it seems likely that new employees in the university sector will not be given the chance to join UniSuper's defined benefit scheme. That has implications for the next generation of researchers, scientists and lecturers. I think we all agree in this chamber that the university sector plays a very important role in both public education and world-class research. The Greens have a vision to support a well-funded, high-quality and sustainable university sector. A number of my colleagues have made this contribution over many years—most recently and most eloquently, of course, Senator Faruqi, who is our higher education spokesperson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just provide a little bit of context as to why I'm especially interested in this bill. I myself worked at the University of Tasmania for nearly 10 years, on and off, as a lecturer, including full time in the last couple of years before I came into the Senate. The University of Tasmania has a direct link to this bill today, especially to UniSuper, because UniSuper was actually formulated and established at the University of Tasmania. The Tasmanians in the chamber would be well aware that the University of Tasmania is one of the largest employers in the state. It used to be the biggest employer; at the moment it's the second-biggest employer. Nevertheless, in my home town of Launceston, where my electorate office is, it is the biggest employer. It plays a critical role not just in the economy but also in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to put on record while I have the opportunity that the Greens are currently campaigning—I know Labor have been supporting us, and I understand there's sympathy from my Tasmanian colleagues—to make sure we have long-term continuity in funding for our scientists and researchers at the University of Western Australia, the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies in Hobart, the Australian Antarctic Division and other institutions, to keep the fantastic, world-beating work that they do there going. That funding faces significant uncertainty. It will fall off a cliff in 2022 due to research decisions that have been made recently. That is a critical part of the community in Hobart. We need to make sure we get the government to commit to long-term funding for Australian Antarctic science, Southern Ocean science and, of course, climate science in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also very concerned at the moment, given the COVID situation we find ourselves in with this pandemic, that the universities, and university workers and employers, have been particularly hard hit. Universities themselves are facing immense fiscal challenges with a drop-off in international student numbers, and we're not sure when they're going to get that certainty back. We understand it's going to be a very difficult recovery for universities, yet university workers, including casual workers, have been excluded from any kind of stimulus payment by this government. It's made it extremely difficult for university workers. So they face almost a perfect storm of pressures on them at the moment with the risks they face into the future, and we need to do everything we can to help employees at the universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned that this bill, without the amendment that has been circulated in the Senate, piles more uncertainty into a sector already in limbo—a sector fighting to overcome the loss of billions of dollars in income and facing a government determined to avoid its responsibilities to assist this industry at a time of unprecedented crisis. I'm not sure why the government hasn't wanted to assist university workers, but I will say this: it's been really obvious to me in the eight years that I've been in the Senate that the government has continued to reduce funding to universities. They've continued this push for privatisation and commercialisation of universities. We've seen significant job losses at universities right around the country. My brother, who lectures at a major university in Western Australia, is continually talking to me about the pressures that his university has faced over many years in this push to essentially privatise education services. The Greens have often advocated in this place for free higher education to provide exactly what I had when I first went to university, a free degree; to try to give young Australians the certainty they need without their having to pay significant amounts of money back to the government; and, of course, to provide the numbers and the funding that are needed to keep employing staff at these universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only are universities facing significant uncertainty with major losses of revenue from student enrolments, the inability to access JobKeeper and impending job losses, especially of insecure casual and fixed term workers, but university staff are now facing uncertainty about whether or not they will have access to defined benefit schemes, which have been among the key features of university employment for nearly 40 years. For those following this debate, defined benefit schemes essentially set a guaranteed payment for workers and for staff that will go into their retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately this will have flow-on effects for the recruitment of new staff, particularly in the regions and the rural areas. As a Tasmanian, I am acutely aware of the challenges faced in recruiting good staff to regional universities. Getting good people to move to the university has been one of the major challenges in moving the University of Western Australia up the rankings. It's an extremely competitive space. This will make it harder for universities to attract and retain top staff, and it's unhelpful, to say the least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, I'm proud to note that UniSuper is a Tasmanian led innovation. The fund was conceived by a group of senior administrators at the University of Tasmania in the late 1970s, and the university provided the corporate vehicle to sponsor the establishment of the trustee company known as UniSuper. The provision of a national and fully portable defined benefit scheme has been of considerable assistance to all Australian universities, and this outstanding achievement continues to assist with the recruitment and retention of qualified staff, especially, as I will mention again, in remote and regional parts of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to point out that this amendment is not an exemption from choice. I can see the minister nodding to that. The amendment ensures that all defined benefit schemes are able to operate on similar terms, while ensuring that those fortunate enough to be offered a defined benefit scheme will still be eligible for choice. This amendment allows a contribution to be made in compliance with choice if an enterprise agreement provides for an employee to join a fund for which the relevant person is eligible to become a defined benefit member, and only where the fund's governing rules permit the relevant person, within a period specified, to choose not to remain a defined benefit member and to choose another fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke in this chamber on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill back in 2018, I expressed concerns about making insurance and superannuation opt-in rather than opt-out. I think the principle applies equally here. Under the proposed amendments, members are able to opt out of defined benefit arrangements within a two-year period. Without these amendments, it is extremely unlikely that anyone will ever be offered a chance to opt in to a defined benefit scheme, owing to the adverse selection risks that have been well documented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be a tragedy if a durable and highly performing fund were sacrificed to an inflexible, one-size-fits-all cookie-cutter all-choice regime. Doing so would deal enormous blows to product diversity in an industry dominated by the same style of largely uniform accumulation-style products. Rejection of this amendment would be all the more ironic, as it would signal the government had opted to deny the choice for defined benefit funds to continue to provide first-class retirement benefits in the best interests of their present and, importantly, future members. No arguments have been advanced that could possibly justify endangering arrangements which have served the higher education sector exceptionally well for many decades. I urge senators to support this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have circulated amendments through the chamber. I look forward to talking them and the Labor Party amendment when we go in committee. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Superannuation, Your Choice) Bill 2019. I am delighted to talk on the great Labor achievement that is our modern superannuation scheme, which has ensured that all Australian workers now have a right to a dignified and prosperous retirement. I want to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Whish-Wilson in his remarks around the university sector. Like Senator Whish-Wilson, I spent some time working in that sector and I am very much apprised of the very significant challenges faced by that workforce pre-COVID and particularly during the COVID period. I put on the record that I am a continuing member of the National Tertiary Education Union, which was my union when I left that workforce to come here to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. It ensures that employees under workplace determinations or enterprise agreements have the right to choose their superannuation fund. This applies only to new workplace determinations and enterprise agreements made on or after 1 July 2020. The bill will allow employees to select the fund that best suits their own circumstances. A lack of super choices can mean that employees who have changed workplaces can end up with multiple super accounts, which can lead to high fees and charges and to them potentially paying multiple insurance premiums. More specifically, the bill will allow employees to choose their own superannuation funds, where they are employed under a workplace determination or enterprise agreement that is made on or after 1 July 2018. New employees to whom such a determination or agreement applies must be provided with a standard choice form, and if there is no chosen fund for a new employee the default fund arrangements apply. An employer does not have to provide existing employees with a form unless requested, once a new determination agreement is made. Where there is no chosen fund for an existing employee, an employer that continues to make compulsory contributions for that employee to the same fund in accordance with the previous determination or agreement will comply with the choice of fund requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always been supportive of super choice and is committed to ensuring that every Australian worker is in a high-performing fund and that adequate information is available to empower consumers with the information that they need to make choices in their best interests. But I am worried that this bill proposed by the government—the Liberal-National party, who has so often taken to superannuation to cut it, to contain it, to diminish it, to abolish it—will not meet those criteria without significant amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill will have relatively minimal impact on the super sector, given that Industry Super Australia estimates that of those employees covered by an enterprise agreement only 7.4 per cent have no choice of superannuation fund, which represents 1.9 per cent of the workforce, the bill will have a significant effect on the retirements of that 1.9 per cent should it pass without amendment. Labor will move an amendment to ensure that there is a provision that allows workers to bargain for a single fund or set of funds where it is determined by the Fair Work Commission to be in their best interests. This amendment proposed by Labor is a commonsense measure that was highlighted in Labor's dissenting committee report on this bill. The report also noted the evidence that the ACTU and UniSuper provided to the committee and enabled the highlighting of the detrimental effect that the bill, if unamended, could have on their default defined-benefit product offering. The amendment that UniSuper provided at paragraph 2.63 of the committee report addresses their concerns and, indeed, many of my concerns about the effects that this bill could have. Any risk to defined benefit offerings lessens choice, rather than enhances it, and would achieve the opposite of what this bill claims it seeks to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we cannot trust this LNP government with superannuation. I have seen many colleagues—members of the government, on the other side of the chamber—who have previously lambasted Australia's world-class superannuation scheme for a quick social media grab. I note Senator Rennick from Queensland, who claimed in a speech last year in this chamber that superannuation is a cancer. He actually said that. To describe superannuation as a cancer is a disgusting slur on all those who have suffered cancer, and as the co-chair of Parliamentary Friends of Cancer Care and Cure, I was revolted and sickened by that comment. It was ill-judged. Super is an enhancement of people's lives. No-one thinks that about cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation has allowed thousands of Australians to share in the dignity of a retirement funded in full or in part by the benefits of superannuation, formerly a privilege that was restricted to public servants, politicians and senior managers in the banking and finance industries. I can tell you that, when I grew up on Curran Road in Blacktown and Aurelia Street in Toongabbie and then Kingsclare Street in Leumeah in Campbelltown, there weren't too many conversations over the back fence about how the superannuation was ticking over. There weren't too many conversations about what a defined benefit was. That gap in the difference of financial literacy was taken seriously by only one party, and that is the Labor Party, who instituted superannuation. That's why we have to watch so carefully what this government seeks to do. They were never committed to delivering superannuation for every Australian. They were quite happy to preserve it as a right for the well-employed in the Public Service and the wealthy who could afford the advice to set up such structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rennick bemoaned the management fees taken by superannuation firms and consultants, but he's been silent on the billions of dollars that this government forks out to consultant firms while sacking thousands of frontline public servants like our posties. Shame on this LNP government! I also note that Senator Bragg from my home state of New South Wales was reported recently as suggesting in his book that workers raid their super to purchase a home. It reveals what a total lack of understanding they have and that a continuing ideological push against the benefits of superannuation for Australia still resides in this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This raid on superannuation was also the Liberal and National parties' answer to economic privations in the pandemic, which saw $14 billion ripped out of the super scheme—out of people's future savings, out of people's retirement—to be spent on a range of things, including, sadly, online gambling and needless purchases. That is even before the next phase of the raid is undertaken, and it's because this government is so loose with how it handles money despite its rhetoric about being great money managers. People should not forget that this is the party that lost $60 billion in a few weeks. Their figures were out by $60 billion. They could've left people with their super intact. They could've supported the Australian people better through this COVID crisis, but they failed. They have compromised people's futures and retirements with regard to super by the actions they have taken in their ideological bent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution from Senator Bragg to the debate on superannuation in recent times only serves to undermine a system that is responsible for giving millions of workers a comfortable retirement. I also notice that the Prime Minister's scheme to allow Australians to withdraw super to pay bills was so riddled with fraud that it had to be temporarily frozen in order for a correction to be made to that structure. My office had to help locals who had thousands of dollars stolen from their accounts by criminals. The government have not yet revealed exactly how many fraudulent claims have been made, because they don't come into this place and transparently reveal the truth. In fact, question time is an exercise in watching them painfully hide from the truth. Neither do we know yet what the government are doing to compensate victims after the ATO directed their super fund to make a payment to a fraudulent account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has form on the shonky ways of moving Australians' money away from them in unedifying and unpalatable ways. Think about robodebt: illegally constructed debts, sent by this government to hundreds of thousands of Australians, which it now needs to repay. They don't care about helping Australians manage their money in ways that are sage and sensible. Rather, they take any opportunity they can to raid Australians' savings and to make them more at risk in terms of their finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the concept of choice, but choice is not the most pressing issue right now in the superannuation sector. Rather, it's a retirement savings gender gap. According to the national advocacy group Women in Super, an older woman generally retires with 47 per cent less superannuation than a man, and yet women will very likely outlive men by at least five years. They're also likely to be the family's most active caregivers as well as the ones most likely to take time off to care for children or elderly relatives, further denuding their super compared to men. This is a problem far more pressing than the issue of choice of super for 1.9 per cent of Australia's workforce. But that is not what the government is choosing to focus on and that is not the legislation before us. Rather, we have this. Instead of solutions we have crickets from the government opposite.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation firms have also been active in addressing the gender wage gap and its knock-on effects in retirement savings. With lower earnings, breaks from their careers to begin families, and longer life expectancy, women face a far different picture to men when it comes to superannuation. Yet some superannuation funds are taking up that challenge. I want to acknowledge, in particular, the work of the SDA and the super fund REST, who have both campaigned very hard to support their majority female workforce in their goal for equitable treatment in retirement.</span>

Currently, older women are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless people in Australia. According to census data, the number of women aged 65 to 74 describing themselves as homeless increased by 51 per cent in the five years to 2016. Shame on this government for presiding over that! Shame on them for their failure to respond to the housing needs of older Australians! Shame on them for taking away the opportunity for improvements in superannuation for Australian women, in particular! With a social housing waiting list in my home state of decades, not years, many will find themselves on the waiting list in their 50s and will die before they're ever near getting into a house.</span>

Like everything else, this government's answer is to throw everything out to the free market, to that perfect neoliberal goal of 'choice', which they dress up as something much greater than it can ever be. But, as Martin Luther King Jr said, 'What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?'

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I am pleased to follow Senator O'Neill because she raises some very important points about this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Superannuation, Your Choice) Bill 2019, and about the government's attitude towards superannuation. I want to add my voice to that debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard or seen comments from the government that Labor senators, or members opposite, are trying to waste the Senate's time by contributing to this debate today, and that couldn't be further from the truth because I think it's important to understand what the government is doing as part of this broader debate around superannuation. I know that it's very clever of the government to call this bill 'Your Superannuation, Your Choice', because it gives them an opportunity to get up here and talk about choice in super and beat their ideological drum about what they have planned for superannuation in this country. But it does concern me greatly that this is another opportunity for the government to talk about their plans to raid Australians' superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill is limited in its scope. It is talking about the small number of workers who, at the moment, are covered by an enterprise agreement that directs the superannuation fund that they use, and the amendments to this bill seek to make sure that people are able to collectively bargain in their workplace while also supporting the principles behind the bill around choice. But we know that this is part of an ideological debate that the Liberals are waging against superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and National parties opposed compulsory superannuation when Labor introduced it in 1992, and they have been fighting this war ever since. But they really have taken it up a notch lately, haven't they? They've really taken up the memes. They're even writing books about it. They're getting op-eds written in the paper about just what they're going to do to superannuation and to Australian workers' superannuation. They've said in this place that superannuation should be voluntary—and they've said that many times; that is not a one-off gaffe from one member of the Liberal Party; we've had many members in this place say that superannuation should be voluntary. Obviously, that is deeply concerning because we know that, for many Australian workers, superannuation is the only way that they will be able to afford a dignified retirement, and we know particularly that there are many women in this country at the moment who did not have access to superannuation or who worked in part-time positions for many years raising their children and who have severely depleted superannuation funds at this moment, compared to the men who were working at the same time as them. So I am deeply concerned about any attacks on compulsory superannuation that would stop Australian workers who desperately need to have money for their retirement saved for that purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government is trying to do is to pretend that they care about the wages of low-income earners. We know that that is nonsense, because the Liberal-National coalition has never stood up for the working conditions of Australia's lowest-paid workers, and they never will. The coalition has opposed the advancement of superannuation every step of the way. They opposed it when we introduced it, and they've sought to undermine it ever since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory superannuation is a national achievement created by Labor, and it stands alongside the NDIS and Medicare as a system which makes our country fairer and stronger. But I want to talk about one aspect of this debate, and that is the proposals from members of the government around extending early access of superannuation payments, because it's one of these ideological fronts on which the Liberals have been waging war. They've said that the coronavirus pandemic has actually shown that more people should have access to their super for more reasons. For example, Liberal John Alexander has floated the idea of using super to buy a home, and I'll talk further about that proposal a little bit later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to make this clear: the primary purpose of superannuation is to provide a dignified retirement for every Australian. That is the primary purpose of superannuation. That is why, right now, there are provisions that allow for early access to superannuation but only in very limited circumstances. These circumstances include compassionate grounds; severe financial hardship; and a terminal medical condition, which is very difficult. I know there are people who find themselves in that situation—getting that very difficult news about being terminally ill—and they know that they have their super there to count on in those very difficult times. Temporary incapacity and permanent incapacity are the other times when people are able to access their super. We know that super accounts have been used as a way to save for a home, by making voluntary payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason Labor have always argued to keep these reasons limited is that we don't want super to fix the policy mistakes of this government. We don't want people to not have super in their retirement or in those very limited circumstances, such as when they're very ill and they're given the absolute worst news—that they need to tie up their affairs. You may have had a friend who went through that. I've got a friend who has been given that news recently, and they've had to rely on their super. I cannot imagine what it would have been like to not have had that superannuation to depend on in those circumstances. Expanding the circumstances where super can be withdrawn will reduce the super balances of thousands of Australians. It'll increase the demand on age pensions, which will have an impact on the budget bottom line—that's what the government is always talking about—but also leave Australians with less money to use when they really need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the other thing. Talking about allowing Australians to withdraw their super to fix a problem of the government's own making should ring alarm bells with people in the electorate, because, when we're talking about withdrawing super because housing has become so unaffordable, what does the government do? Do they build more social housing? Do they talk about how they're going to make housing more affordable? Do they make a plan to build better cities, to make them more connective, or to build better transport so people don't have to travel so far to their workplaces? No, they don't do that. They say, 'You can use your retirement savings for this instead.' Senator Bragg has even said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is a first home is much more important than super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is saying that a first home is not important. But what you're saying is that people don't deserve both—that they don't deserve a home and a dignified retirement. That's what you're saying to people like nurses and teachers who are out there working and saving. You're saying that the government doesn't want to do the hard work to make housing more affordable. What it wants to do is raid people's retirement savings. We know that Australian workers need those retirement savings later on in life. They will be relying on them. But instead of doing something to make housing more affordable, instead of trying to fix that problem, the government just wants to come in and raid superannuation savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's lazy, it's pompous, it shows that you've got no idea what workers go through, it shows that you have no appreciation of how difficult it is for people to save for their retirement and it shows that you're completely out of touch with the purpose of superannuation in the first place, which is to provide a dignified retirement for Australian workers. I want Australians out there to be very careful when they hear this rhetoric from the Liberal-National government. When the government is saying to Australians that it wants to open up early access to super payments for other purposes, I want Australians to consider why that is and what policy failure by this government has created that problem in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the same thing happen with young workers during this pandemic. Instead of relying on government support, instead of being included in JobKeeper, many young Australians have had to rely on their superannuation to support themselves through this pandemic. This is a government which is setting up millions of younger Australians to be in a weaker position in their retirement. Already, we have seen that 500,000 young workers under the age of 30 have dipped into their super early. This makes up one-third of all early super applicants. In many cases, young workers have been left with no choice other than to empty all of their retirement savings. All of their retirement savings are gone, and that might not mean much if you're 25 years old and you consider that you've got a long time before your retirement but, again, what it points to is that this government isn't prepared to do the work to build the policies, to give the support to young people; instead, they have said, 'You can use your superannuation because we're not going to give you the support that you need.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short term, this scheme is expected to cost the budget $1.1 billion in lost revenue. We know that this will have an impact on the budget. In the long term, it means fewer Australians will be able to support their retirement and that will mean more people demanding the pension system. We also know that this hasn't happened in a vacuum. Industry super analysis shows that in North Queensland alone 65,000 workers have been short-changed super and that government offered an amnesty to businesses that have systematically underpaid their workers. So not only do we have workers being asked to rely on their super during the most difficult economic time in their lives but it's off the back of years of underpayment of superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has used every opportunity to undermine super, including this pandemic, and that is completely disgraceful. We should be strengthening the systems that support people during this pandemic, not making them weaker. We even know that the government's incompetence has opened the door to widespread fraud in the early access super scheme. I was listening to triple j's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hack</span> last night. Some people said the government just made it so easy to get this money that we've seen fraud as a result of this government's incompetence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, superannuation is there for one reason: to provide Australians with a dignified retirement. Every time that the government come in here and try to reduce that access to a dignified retirement, Labor will come in here and show them out. We will stand in here and explain to people exactly what the government are up to. You can create your shiny memes, you can write your books and do your op-eds, but, at the end of the day, workers understand that superannuation is there for their retirement. We know that this government won't be supporting workers in their retirement; they will have to do it on their own. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Superannuation, Your Choice) Bill 2019. Labor has a very proud track record when it comes to superannuation and will continue to fight for a stronger and fairer superannuation system. Compulsory superannuation, created by Labor, is a national achievement which sits alongside Medicare and the NDIS as major nation-building reforms. It has made our nation stronger and it's made our society fairer. Prior to the introduction of compulsory superannuation, most Australians only had the aged pension to rely on in their retirement. The introduction of compulsory superannuation was a revolutionary policy and achievement of the Hawke-Keating government. Labor and the union movement fought for and won compulsory employer-paid superannuation. We did this through national worker led campaigns, together with legislative action in this parliament, that today has resulted in a universal workplace right to occupational superannuation. This right was once only available to people like us—politicians, public servants, senior managers and long-serving employees in certain industries such as, let's remember, the banking and financial services industry. As I said, superannuation is a universal right and one that is enjoyed by all people in this building, not just those that sit in this place or in the other place, and it's available across every industry and sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory superannuation has been an incredible success. It provided a new system for funding retirement incomes. This not only creates retirement nest eggs for Australians; the savings are being invested in infrastructure and businesses which are generating wealth and creating jobs. Superannuation assets totalled $2.7 trillion at the end of the March 2020 quarter. Our super system is world class and has created a huge new pool of capital that can invest in Australian business. According to the Willis Towers Watson Global Pension Assets Study 2019, Australia remained the world's fourth-largest pension market, with Australia's superannuation assets rising to 131 per cent of GDP in 2018—up from 67 per cent a decade before. This latest ratio was the second highest among the 22 major pension markets covered by the survey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber know that the Liberal Party has always opposed universal superannuation, and we are seeing it once again today. It was opposed by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, when it was first introduced, and he brought this opposition to government when he became Prime Minister. The Howard government's 1996 decision to abandon the Keating government's 15 per cent superannuation guarantee cost the average Australian worker roughly $250,000 in accumulation over their working life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, superannuation is still opposed by the Liberals now. The Morrison government has used the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to escalate the coalition's decades-long ideological war against super in general and industry super in particular. Coalition governments have used every opportunity to undermine superannuation, including the current process that has seen two million Australians resorting to accessing more than $13 billion in personal retirement savings. Why have they been forced to access these savings? Because of the gaping hole in government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's track record and ideological opposition to industry super funds causes me to be more than a little bit cynical about the reasons behind this bill, let alone its name. We know that those opposite come up with lovely, caring names for their bills. But we know that beneath the first pages of those bills there are often situations where workers are going to be worse off. I believe this bill is just a demonstration, once again, of the ideological opposition to industry super funds that, as I said, those opposite so often convey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that the ideological opposition to industry super funds goes even further amongst some members of the Liberal-National party caucus. We've seen Senator Bragg call for all kinds of superannuation to be made voluntary for people earning under $50,000 a year. He was backed up in that call, as the previous speaker, Senator Green, mentioned, by members of his caucus. On 13 November last year, Senator Rennick—yes, that very same senator who said, 'We do not want the hand of government reaching in and taking away our children's youth,' in a debate on early childhood education—called superannuation 'a cancer', stating in his speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Millions of dollars gets sucked out of the pockets of the battlers in the bush and sent to the blowhards in Sydney and Melbourne …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just say that, as a cancer survivor, I was horrified to hear that comment. I don't think anybody from any party should refer to a benefit, especially a hard-won and hard-fought-for benefit for workers, as a cancer. I took great umbrage at that comment, and I'm glad to put on the record today how angry—and I was angry—that comment made me and other cancer survivors and cancer sufferers not only throughout my state of Tasmania—I know, because some of them spoke to me about it—but also throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government just refused to listen to advice, and that's why they put so much of the hard-earned superannuation savings of Australians at risk. We've seen billions of dollars taken from the accounts of our lowest waged employees. And of course we know that in early May the government was forced to temporarily freeze the scheme because of fraud. The Australian Federal Police have still not ruled out the involvement of organised and offshore crime in this fraud. I'm not quite sure what the government is doing, because they're yet to reveal how many fraudulent claims have been made or what the government is doing to compensate victims after the ATO directed their super fund to make a payment to a fraudulent account. It has also been reported that there is an alarming trend of super funds being plunged directly into online gambling—and we all know that that cannot be good. If true, the embattled government scheme may be boosting the profits of dodgy overseas gambling businesses instead of stimulating the economy and addressing cases of real hardship. But we know that those opposite don't care—and they certainly don't care about super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the minister responsible and the Prime Minister to come clean with that information that needs to be asked about that fraudulent activity. We've got a government that is intent on attacking workers' wages, their conditions and their ability to better organise for better rights at work. But now it wants to destroy their retirement income. Do you just want everyone to end up on the pension—is that what it's about? I can explain to you that, with an ageing population, that's not going to be a very smart move on your behalf. The rate of the superannuation guarantee has been scheduled to progressively rise to 12 per cent in 2022 but, of course, it was frozen by the Abbott government in 2014. When the superannuation system was designed it was intended that the guarantee would rise. Analysis by Industry Super Australia shows that if the superannuation guarantee moved to 12 per cent, as the last Labor government intended, a 30-year-old male earning $85,000 a year would stand to gain $147,000 from their super by the time they reach retirement—compared with if the super guarantee was frozen at 9½ per cent. Separately, a 30-year-old woman earning $85,000 a year who takes time off work to have children could gain up to $93,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months $20 billion of superannuation assets have moved into the not-for-profit sector, with consumers in search of lower fees and higher performance. Choice is already happening. While too many Australians still retire without adequate retirement savings our super system needs to be strengthened and protected, not undermined. It's clear that every move this government makes is to undermine the most successful retirement savings scheme in the world. The bill we are debating today is entirely designed to continue this attack. The government wants to dismantle the system we have in order to advantage the mates of those opposite in the banking sector. Let me be clear: industry funds benefit members, not big banks as those opposite would wish to do. They outperform retail funds again and again. I would like to quote from a report by the McKell Institute. The report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… available evidence demonstrates a clear causal relationship between not-for-profit representative governance funds and higher levels of returns for members. Both raw and risk-adjusted research supports the proposition that the two governance models produce significantly different returns for their members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2013, Industry Super Australia concluded that had all superannuation funds returned the 5.7 per cent long-term annual average of not-for-profit funds, Australia’s retirement savings would be $88 billion higher. In 2016, a similar analysis showed that if retail funds had earned the same returns as industry super funds between 1996 and 2015, Australia’s pool of super retirement savings would be roughly $105 billion greater; an increase of more than 5 per cent than the actual situation. Based on these figures, an individual member, with a starting balance of $20,000, could have been $36,000 better off by using an industry fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite want employees to be forced into slickly marketed funds which promise the world but in the end just return super profits to the big banks. They don't really care about choice. As I've said, it's entirely a cover for enriching their mates. They want to ensure that dodgy employers can force employees into the super fund of their bank's choice for the employer's own profit. If they did care about Australians having better retirement savings, they wouldn't have cut the super guarantee in 1996 and 2014 and they wouldn't have Senator Rennick over there saying superannuation is a cancer and should be made voluntary. In fact, they probably shouldn't have him over there at all, with some of the comments he's come out with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports choice in superannuation, but we are also committed to making sure every worker is in a high performing fund and that adequate information is available to empower consumers with the information they need to make choices in their best interests. Labor remains concerned that there is a significant risk to defined benefit offerings, which will lessen choice and achieve the opposite objective to what the bill intends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor referred the super choice legislation to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to ensure the bill had no unforeseen or unintended consequences which left super fund members worse off or with less choice. In their dissenting report, Labor senators noted the ACTU's evidence highlighting the detrimental effects that the bill could have on defined benefit product offerings. The ACTU said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Should the bill pass, some superannuation funds would need to re-evaluate how and if they could offer their products. UniSuper is one of the best performing super funds in the country. It offers one of the rarest and most valuable retirement products available, which is an open defined-benefits scheme. This is an incredibly generous product which guarantees retirement incomes for life, and that is why the National Tertiary Education Union bargains for this fund for their workers. Its viability is centred on longevity risk of each member and the fact that it is compulsory. If workers were to choose to be a member then this would be evidence of self-selection into the fund and thus would increase the risk of the product failing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Should the bill pass, the fund could seriously reconsider the offering of the product to its members and potentially close off entry to one of the most beneficial outcomes for hundreds of thousands of members. The ACTU opposes this bill and is seeking amendments which would protect workers in circumstances where they would be better off having a single fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also noted evidence from UniSuper, which similarly highlighted the detrimental effect that the bill, unamended, could have on the defined benefit product offering. UniSuper also provided to the committee an amendment that addresses their concerns. Labor will move amendments to address the issues raised by UniSuper relating to defined benefits scheme in order to ensure that the bill does not inadvertently threaten the viability of these schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us on this side know that workers are better off as a result of collective bargaining. Industry Super Australia estimates that, of those employees covered by enterprise agreements, only 7.4 per cent have no choice of superannuation fund. This represents just 1.9 per cent of the workforce. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  First, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate today and yesterday. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Superannuation, Your Choice) Bill 2019 addresses a long-running issue in the superannuation system and will mean better outcomes for many, many Australians. The Productivity Commission noted that the current system, which restricts choice of fund for some members, can discourage member engagement, and it concluded that this reform was much needed. The Productivity Commission report also highlighted the negative effects that unintentionally holding multiple superannuation accounts were having on millions of Australians, with duplicate fees and insurance premiums. Through its Protecting Your Super package the government took action to address the stock of these duplicate accounts, and this bill is the next step, ensuring that Australians are not forced into having multiple accounts because of their enterprise agreement or a similar determination. The bill will also encourage greater member engagement, promote competition and address situations where a member disagrees with the choice of fund their employer has made for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While choice is vital, as Centre Alliance pointed out in its additional comments to the Senate committee on this bill, informed choice is equally as important. Improving members' ability to make informed choices by providing simple and accessible comparison information about superannuation products was a key recommendation of the Productivity Commission landmark report on the superannuation system. While a number of recommendations from that Productivity Commission report have already been addressed, including a retirement income review, the Treasurer is currently considering a more comprehensive response to that Productivity Commission report and will issue that response in due course. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the government has committed to changing the way that people are defaulted into superannuation products, including to ensure that members are only defaulted one time. Preventing people from languishing in underperforming funds will underpin any changes that we make to default superannuation. This bill is the first step in providing choice, improving competition and improving outcomes for members, and the bill will commence on 1 July 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have listened very carefully to all the contributions to this debate, and they have been impassioned and they have been sincere, but, in all honesty, they have largely also been somewhat irrelevant, very ideological and often just plain wrong. I think it's important to acknowledge some of the straw men of this argument. This bill has nothing to do with the early release of super scheme, which is an initiative that was supported by the Labor Party and has been supported now by over two million Australians who have been grateful for the access to their superannuation in this temporary scheme during a period of financial distress. This bill has nothing to do with undermining enterprise bargaining negotiations. Unions can still collectively bargain wages and conditions. They can still name a default fund. This bill doesn't change the default system one iota. For those who don't choose a fund, their employer can still do it for them. This bill has nothing to do with the industry versus retail, versus public, versus corporate, versus self-managed super debate. Indeed, diversity within this sector is fundamental to the premise of this bill. Competition is good; it drives down fees. We want all sectors to thrive. In the same vein, this bill has nothing to do with the debate between defined benefit and defined contribution—again, quite the opposite. We would like to see more people be able to choose the fund that suits them best, including defined benefit schemes. This bill has nothing to do with wage theft, it has nothing to do with super theft, it has nothing to do with the extent of the rollout of Single Touch Payroll—an initiative, I might add, that this government has implemented, and it has been possibly the most effective deterrent to wage and super theft ever initiated by a parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill—your super, your choice—has nothing to do with any of those things. If those are the arguments that this Senate is prosecuting here, you have either intentionally or inadvertently misunderstood this bill. It's about a basic and fundamental right, which is choice to do what you want with your own money. In the same way that we don't let our employers choose our bank account or our bank, and we make that choice a condition of employment, so too should we not let our employers choose our super fund. This bill removes the ability of an employment agreement to demand that you contribute to a particular super fund as a condition of that employment. This is even more important in a system where superannuation is compulsory. When the government mandates that nearly one dollar in 10 of your hard-earned wages must be quarantined, and potentially for up to 45 years, surely you should at least have some say as to where that money is invested and what it's invested in. So choice is indeed a logical and necessary corollary of compulsion. In Australia we compel people to vote, but we don't tell them who to vote for or force them to vote for someone that they don't want. Well, in Australia we also compel people to contribute to superannuation to save money for retirement, and, similarly, we shouldn't tell them where to save their money or which fund they should contribute to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, the Financial System Inquiry, the Productivity Commission and, indeed, the Fair Work Commission have all made it abundantly clear that denying or even restricting choice has long-term impacts on superannuation savings, and casuals are particularly vulnerable. Hand on heart, despite what you may have heard from those opposite, I am a super believer, and all the things that I have ever said in this chamber, in public and in private attest to this. And to those opposite: you know it. But, if you think that the system we have now is perfect; if you think it's actually serving the workers that you represent as best as it could; if you think that high fees, duplicate accounts, inappropriately applied insurance, unnecessary opacity and complexity and persistently underperforming funds that, without this bill, will have the ability to lock disengaged workers into them for years and years of erosion of their retirement savings are all okay, then are you really doing the right thing by the people you claim to represent? I cannot understand why you are circling the wagons on this issue. Super is good. But it can be so much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about dismantling super—quite the opposite. 'Your super, your choice' is about building a superannuation system that will serve Australians well for the next 30 years, and surely that is something that we all want. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've made clear in this debate, Labor supports choice in superannuation, but we are committed to making sure that every worker is in a high-performing fund and that adequate information is available to empower consumers with the information they need to make choices that are in their best interests. We are concerned that there is a significant risk that this bill poses to defined benefit offerings, and we're concerned that the effect of this risk will be to lessen choice and to achieve the opposite of what this bill purports to achieve. These amendments specifically address the issues raised by UniSuper when they appeared before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in its inquiry into the bill. They address issues relating to defined benefit schemes in order to ensure that the bill does not inadvertently threaten the viability of those schemes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, which began on 25 June 1950 when North Korean forces invaded South Korea. Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy personnel fought to defend South Korea as part of the United Nations multinational force. The war ended on 27 July 1953, three years and one month, almost to the day, after it began, with some Australian defence personnel staying on as part of the peacekeeping force until 1957.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian War Memorial has an extensive range of documents and artefacts relating to the Korean War. During my research I found that the United Nations Commission on Korea was established in 1948 to monitor the withdrawal of World War II occupation forces from Korea. However, in May 1950, as war loomed on the Korean peninsula, two Australian military observers, Major Peach and Squadron Leader Rankin, were on the ground monitoring activity. They were Australia's smallest peacekeeping contingent but were vitally important, as they were the only UNCOK observers in place when North Korea invaded South Korea. It was their report that proved North Korea had initiated hostilities that was the evidence that the UN needed to intervene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dean Smith and I moved a Senate motion to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War last month. We moved that the Senate note that 25 June 2020 would mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War and that 24 April 2021 would mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Kapyong. The Battle of Kapyong is considered a decisive conflict that resulted in significant Australian sacrifice: 32 soldiers killed, 59 wounded and three imprisoned. The successful motion also noted the number of Western Australians who perished in the Korean War, those who have died since and the surviving veterans. However, the motion was also an acknowledgement of the more than 700 Tasmanians who fought in this war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While many listening here today might know of the Korean War through historical studies or the popular US television series <span style="font-style:italic;">M*A*S*H</span>, I have a personal connection to this conflict through my family that I would like to share with you today. My uncle Douglas, better known as Doug Bushby, worked as a UN accredited war correspondent during the Korean War, and my father, Max Bushby, OBE, joined his brother towards the end of the war as a correspondent too. In his role as a war correspondent, Doug Bushby covered the war itself, but he is better known for his films and photographs depicting the scenes that went on behind the conflict, which were caused by the war itself. Some of this work can be viewed at the Australian War Memorial, not far from here, with this exhibition accompanied by relics that my uncle brought home to Launceston with him when he returned. He subsequently donated many of these items to the War Memorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these items is a full-length feature film that Doug Bushby made about the Korean War, which was edited in Hollywood. But one of the most significant pieces is a photograph of my uncle holding a red, silk Communist peace flag and a certificate. The flag was taken from the Chinese lines at the Hook, which has also been documented as 'the bloody Hook' after being the scene of one of the final battles in this war. The Chinese flew four peace flags from their positions on a ridge line opposite the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, 2RAR, just after the ceasefire came into force. The red flag my uncle held included signatures from two Australian lieutenants, a Chinese major and the Korean army's chief of staff, all of whom signed on the day peace was declared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">2RAR were stationed in Puckapunyal in Victoria prior to leaving for Korea on 5 March 1953 on board the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">New Australia</span>. They arrived in Korea on 17 March and patrolled the no-man's-land to the north of UN lines, including sections of the Jamestown Line and the hill I referred to called earlier, called the Hook. On 24 July 1953, Chinese forces attacked 2RAR and a US marine regiment at the Hook, and this battle continued on 25 July. 2RAR held firm against these attacks, and the Chinese forces abandoned the Hook on the morning of 26 July. The armistice came into effect at 10 pm the following night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My uncle was visiting the Australian troops just after the ceasefire in August 1953 and asked the Australian soldiers if they could make contact with the Chinese. This was arranged, and Doug Bushby gifted his wallet to English-speaking Chinese officer Hshwang Shon Kwang, asking if he could have one of the four flags in exchange. Two flags were retrieved from the ridge line, and the Chinese officer presented a red flag and a green flag to the Australians, inscribing both flags with Doug's pen. The red peace flag, which my uncle kept, says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Presented by the Chinese People's Volunteers. We Chinese want peace and the British want peace too. We will unite to bring peace to the whole world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The certificate my uncle holds in his left hand was a citation for service to the Chaplain Corps. It was presented to him by the Chief of Naval Operations of the Republic of Korea, Vice Admiral Park Ok-kyu, on 6 August 1953. My uncle published a translation of the citation in his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventures in Revival</span>. The inscription reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">TO: DOUGLAS BUSHBY, United Nations War Correspondent. You have largely contributed to newly organised the Republic of Korea Navy as a member of War Correspondents to the United Nations from the period of April 1953 to August 1953. You have distributed a large quantity of religious tracts and pamphlets regardless the unfavourable conditions, in order to inspire the morale and encourage the religious faith among the officers and men of our Navy and Marine Corps. Especially you served in the fierce battle line under the shower of enemy shells by taking pictures of real battle scenes and spreading them throughout the United Nations. Therefore, I sincerely confer you this letter of appreciation. Mr Bushby, an Australian UN accredited War Correspondent and devout Christian, committed much of his time to relief and missionary work amongst Korean refugees, orphans and North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned, while in Korea during the war my uncle spent a lot of time providing relief and conducting missionary work for the Korean refugees, orphans and North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. There is another photo showing him being presented with a bunch of flowers by a North Korean prisoner of war and a prisoner-of-war chaplain, when he accompanied US Army chaplain Harold Voelkel on a visit to the Nonsan prisoner-of-war camp. During this visit, he preached to the prisoner-of-war congregation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Douglas (Doug) Bushby … is well known for his compelling images of the Korean War.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, she writes further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He is less well known for the hundreds of hours he dedicated to helping orphans, the wounded and POWs.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">His standing within these communities in Korea was obviously significant, based on not only the accounts I've been told but also the inscription on the certificate from Rear Admiral Park Ok-gyu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doug Bushby's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventures in Revival</span> includes several chapters depicting what he experienced during the Korean War and his mission work in the country with prisoners of war. The book also includes several of the photos he took as a war correspondent, including of the United Nations Honor Guard when the truce was signed and of the churches he found and the people he met. Interestingly, a copy of this book has been listed for sale on the British eBay site for US$100.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Amanda Price wrote in her opinion piece that I mentioned earlier:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… no one was prepared for the sheer scope and force of the evil that would engulf the Korean Peninsula. No one anticipated that cities and villages on both sides would be razed, or that millions would lose everything they had, including their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   …   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To find even a faint silhouette of goodness during the Korean War was, understandably, beyond the grasp of many. Yet, amid the sulfurous clouds and charcoal smoke, such moments did exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The horror of the Korean War, of any war, is hard to fathom for those of us who have not served. However, it is through war correspondence, like my uncle and father shared, that we can gain some understanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doug Bushby put himself on the line to help others, and it is that compassion to which I wish to pay tribute. I'm proud of the involvement of both my uncle and father in reporting stories of the Korean War, especially around the time of the armistice being signed. Through their storytelling, both men played an important role in sharing stories from this war 70 years ago. I note that I myself was fortunate to visit South Korea in 2005 as part of an APEC trip, and I actually stood in the DMZ where the armistice was signed. Standing in that room where both my uncle and my father had been for that historic moment was quite an emotional moment for me, as you can imagine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to co-sponsor the motion with Senator Dean Smith last month. Australian soldiers fought valiantly during the Korean War, and their sacrifice deserves to be recognised on such a significant anniversary.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  In recent weeks we've seen hundreds of thousands of Australians take to the streets to march and to call on the reduction that's necessary in black deaths in custody and, certainly, the high incarceration rates of First Nations people. As a 19-year-old and 20-year-old, as a journalist for the ABC, I covered the royal commission into black deaths in custody, in particular in Darwin, and also the day when Elliott Johnston brought down the recommendations. We could then talk about the names of the 99 people who had died. At the time my colleague Senator Pat Dodson was one of the royal commissioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an incredible journey. Yet when we look at the deaths of over 437 or 438—possibly 439—Aboriginal people since then, we don't really know all of their names. I looked through the Australian Institute of Criminology website and saw the statistics, but it is <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> Australia's Deaths Inside database that documents the names. They collected and analysed all available coronial data and other sources to build a searchable database of First Nations deaths in custody since 2008. So we certainly don't know the names of those who died between 1991, when the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody were handed down, and 2008. As I said, the Australian Institute of Criminology has the statistics but we don't know the names of those people or the circumstances surrounding their deaths. They're just numbers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take the time that I have now to mention as many names that I can and pay my respects to those families who are still seeking justice for their loved ones and wanting to know what has happened. On 29 March 2020, an unknown male, 30, was arrested and taken to Horsham police station, where his condition deteriorated. He was transported to hospital by ambulance, where he later died. On 21 March this year, TC, female, 40, was found dead in her single cell at Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre. On 2 January this year, Ms Walker, 37, was arrested for shoplifting on 31 December 2019 and denied bail. She was remanded at a maximum security women's prison, the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, and found dead three days later. On 9 November 29, Mr Walker, 19, died after he was shot at Yuendumu when two police officers went to his house to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence. On 6 November 2019 an unknown male, 20, fell 10 metres to his death while being escorted from Gosford Hospital to Kariong Correctional Centre.</span>

On 17 September 2019 Ms Clarke, 27, was shot dead by a police officer outside her house in Geraldton in Western Australia. On 12 June 2019, JB, male, 30, was found unresponsive in his cell in Acacia Prison and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. Authorities warned he was suicidal. On 9 April 2019, Cherdeena Wynne, 26, died in hospital five days after she became unresponsive after being handcuffed by police on a side street off Albany Highway. On 14 March 2019, T Walton, 21, was shot multiple times by police who were seeking to question him. On 11 February 2019, A Eades, 46, was allegedly attacked by other prisoners and found critically injured in his prison cell on 26 February 2019. He died in hospital 13 days later. His injuries included a broken neck, severe brain swelling and facial fractures and lacerations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 September 2018, CD, male, 16, drowned in the Swan River in Perth while trying to escape an on-foot chase by police. On 10 September 2018, TS, male, 17, drowned alongside his best mate, CD, while fleeing police who were chasing him and four other boys on foot following reports of teenagers jumping fences. He and three other teenagers entered the river to escape but only two made it out. On 1 September 2018, Nathan Reynolds, 36, died in custody in the Outer Metropolitan Multi-Purpose Correctional Centre, a minimum security prison in South Windsor, allegedly following a severe asthma attack. On 29 June 2018, DK, male, 34, stopped breathing during arrest while being removed from a house by police. On 3 May 2018, Mr Yeeda, 19, collapsed in West Kimberley Regional Prison in Western Australia and was declared dead less than an hour later at Derby Hospital.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 February 2018, TK, male, 39, became unresponsive after police attended his Townsville home and he was forcibly restrained. On 7 February 2018, Patrick Fisher, 31, fell from a 13th-floor balcony in a Waterloo public housing block in Sydney while allegedly trying to climb down to escape from police. On 3 February 2018, JH, male, 23, was found hanged in his cell at the Junee Correctional Centre in New South Wales two days before he was due to face court. On 22 September 2017, Ms Day, 55, died 17 days after falling in the cells of Castlemaine Police Station after being arrested for public drunkenness. On 4 December 2017, TMH, male, 47, had a heart attack while being loaded into an ambulance and later died in Boulder, Western Australia. On 22 September 2017, Tane Richard Chatfield, 22, was found unresponsive in his cell after being separated from his cellmate and receiving medical treatment for a seizure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 August 2017, KG, male, 47, was discovered unresponsive in an observation cell at the Adelaide City Watch House. On 8 August 2017, JT, male, 39, died. He had complained of chest pain the day before his death, but prison staff in the Northern Territory mistakenly believed he was complaining of a sore throat. On 4 July 2017, EJW, male, 35, died in hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage in prison. He was shackled to the bed in the last days of his life, despite being unconscious and unresponsive. On 25 June 2017, R Thomas, 29, was thrown from his car after an accident while being pursued by a highway patrol car.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 26 May 2017, PR, male, 50, became unresponsive after being arrested, handcuffed and placed in a prone restraint position by South Australian police outside his house in Parafield Gardens. An ambulance was called, but he was unable to be revived. On 12 May 2017, C Riley, male, 40, died after being shot by police with a stun gun in an Officeworks car park in East Perth. On 29 March 2017, TAS, male, 35, was critically injured when the car he was driving flipped less than a minute after police began a pursuit in Bathurst. He died in hospital a short time later. On 1 March 2017, J Anderson, 23, died in Fiona Stanley Hospital after being found hanged in a 'safe' cell at Hakea Prison. On 4 January 2017, RPN, male, 62, died at Alice Springs Hospital of renal and liver failure while serving a mandatory life sentence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people that hundreds of thousands of Australians walked the streets for this week and last week, and they will no doubt continue to do so. We don't know some of the other names, or a lot of the other names, but we certainly pay our respects to those families still seeking justice, equality and fairness in our country. We must never stop the pursuit of justice, equality and fairness for all Australians, especially First Nations people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  Can I just thank Senator McCarthy for an incredibly moving speech and thank her for bringing those really important stories to the attention of the Senate today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in this chamber will have received emails from an increasingly desperate number of temporary visa holders that are currently stranded overseas and unable to return to Australia due to the COVID-19 travel ban. Our borders closed on 20 March, so it's been three months that so many people who call Australia home have been trapped overseas—three months that people have been separated from their partners, three months that many parents have been separated from their children, three months that people have been separated from their homes, their friends, their pets, their jobs, their businesses and their lives in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many stories that have been shared with my office, from people like Chaithra Shankar, who rushed to India after her mother was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo immediate surgery. Her husband and four-year-old son stayed at home in Melbourne. She planned to be away for a week but couldn't get back before the borders closed. She writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My son has never stayed away from me for such a long period and is too young to completely comprehend the reason behind this … He is crying daily in the video call requesting me to return back … It's so painful to watch him like that … I have lost all faith … I'm dying every day … I can't live without him ... I just want to come back to my son.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chaithra's requests for a travel exemption have been rejected 22 times by the government. There is also Londa James, who arrived with her two children, aged four and 16, to start work as a teacher in Melbourne in February. Her eight-year-old daughter's passport was delayed, so her husband and daughter stayed in Abu Dhabi to wait for her passport to arrive. Then the borders closed. She writes: 'My concern is I've never been away from my children for such a long time. My daughter is now displaying changes in her behaviour and signs of anxiety as a result of the separation. We have two medical reports as proof of this to support our application in the hope that there would be some mercy shown to us.' She's still unable to come to Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Urooj Usman, who took her two children to see her dying father in Pakistan. Her husband stayed in Australia. She booked a flight that would land in Australia before the borders closed, but her flight was delayed—by just two hours—so the airline turned her and her children around in Dubai. She writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every single passing day is increasing my anxiety and pain. It’s been three months now I am separated from my husband and my kids are separated from their father. This situation is very stressful and overwhelming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Urooj has been rejected six times from returning to Australia but has just received a permanent residency approval. But to become a permanent resident Urooj needs to lodge the application that she has been approved for from within Australia. Of course, she can't because she's stranded overseas. Perversely, if she had that permanent residency, Urooj would be able to come home immediately, without needing an exemption. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These families have all applied for travel exemptions under the 'compelling and compassionate' category and have had all their applications rejected by the government multiple times. Why? How are these cases not compelling and worthy of compassion? Without any publicly available criteria on how these and many other requests are being triaged and assessed, we simply have no way of knowing why the government is rejecting these claims. So I ask the government now: why are you blocking parents from being reunited with their young children? Why are you stopping children from returning to their schools? Why are you tearing families and their lives apart? When will the government publicly release the criteria by which temporary visa holders are having their applications for travel ban exemptions assessed? At the very least, if you've got a home here, a job here or immediate family here, you should be allowed to return to Australia. It's time to bring these people home. In fact, it's long past time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next I want to talk about people who are stranded overseas on an expired bridging visa B. Like other temporary visa holders, they have their homes, their jobs, their businesses, their partners, their children and their lives in Australia. However, these visas have a time limit on them, and, despite these people's best efforts to get back to Australia before the borders closed, they became stranded and their visas have now expired. They are people like Henrietta Haldane, who writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I moved to Australia in 2017 to be with my daughter who is an Australian Citizen … I came on holiday to Japan for 3 weeks to visit my son on a Bridging Visa B, which expired on the 27th May … My son has submitted the exemption form 8 times, only to be rejected … I am 80 years old and suffer from high blood pressure, so this stress is not doing me any favours. I just want to go back to my home in Sydney and to my daughter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's Ruchita Patel, who writes: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We came to India on a Bridging Visa B, which expired on the 20th of May ... I am stuck here with my 8 year old son ... My husband is there in Australia ... My son is missing his school too ... My husband is struggling alone from the last 3 months in this pandemic situation and we are desperate to meet him ASAP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ruchita's son is in year 3 at the Bomaderry Public School in Nowra, New South Wales, and has now missed almost two terms of school. Or there's Rafay Jameel, stranded in Pakistan, who writes: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been living in Australia for more than 7 years... I have a job where my employer desperately needs me back. I have a house I am still paying rent and all the utility bills for. I am on Bridging Visa B which expired on 26 May. I am extremely worried and going through depression because if I don’t come back soon I am afraid all my 7 years of hard work will be lost and I will be left with nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These families and these people have invested their time, energy, skills and passion into Australia. They are part of our communities, they are part of our schools, they are part of our businesses, and they are guests in our country. They pay their taxes, but they don't have access to social security or Medicare. They are here under their own steam. They love Australia and proudly look forward to the day when, hopefully, they can become permanent residents and citizens of our country. They're expressing a great trauma at being ripped from their homes and lives during a once-in-a-generation pandemic. They simply cannot understand why they are being blocked at every turn from returning to their homes, with no end in sight, with no point in time to focus on and with nothing to stay hopeful for.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to urgently announce new visa arrangements for people stranded overseas on expired bridging visa Bs, so that they can return to their children, their partners, their families, their homes, their work and their lives here in Australia. It's just not good enough for decisions that impact on temporary visa holders to be made on an arbitrary basis by an unaccountable public official, without any publicly-released criteria being made available so that people can understand why their applications are being rejected.</span>

These people all understand they would need to be quarantined for two weeks when they arrive back in Australia and most of them have indicated that they are very happy to pay any costs associated with that. They just want to return home to their lives and their families and their jobs in this country, which we have invited them into as our guests. We're a better country than this and we need to do better.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of General Motors to discontinue Holden operations in Australia is their prerogative, but their appalling conduct, their appalling misbehaviour in how they are dealing with Holden dealers, how they are dealing with the Holden family in Australia, is to be condemned, because what is becoming clearer and clearer is that General Motors did not convey such plans to Holden dealers until the last possible second of the last possible minute. In doing so, General Motors has acted irresponsibly and in a manner that is very unfair to the very ambassadors that have enabled General Motors to operate in the Australian marketplace. I'm talking about Holden dealers. This is a kick in the stomach to Holden dealers and their families. It is a kick in the stomach to the Holden family here in Australia. We're not just talking about Holden dealers; we're talking about the allied trades, the mechanics, the receptionists, the sales staff—tens of thousands of people. Shame on you, General Motors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Holden brand is more than just a car with four wheels. The Holden brand might now be worthless to General Motors, but to Australia it is priceless. I have written, as I have said previously in this place, to Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors, asking to buy the Holden brand for a dollar—not because it is worthless but because it is priceless. I'm yet to get a response from Ms Barra. Holden is the livelihood of many Australians, particularly in rural and regional communities. I have said it before and I'll keep saying it until I'm blue in the face: be better, General Motors, because I'm going to keep on fighting for Holden dealers and the Holden family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally damning is the scandal of Paradise Dam. You don't hear about Paradise Dam in the Bermuda triangle that is Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. You don't hear about it in the press gallery. You don't hear about Paradise Dam much from the Queensland Labor government because they don't want you to know and they don't want anyone to know. In my last statement to the Senate on Paradise Dam, I called on the Queensland Labor government to release the commission of inquiry's report into the dam before they started to tear it down. We have a unique situation in Queensland. We have a Labor government that are not only not building dams and not supporting the building of dams but are actually tearing down dams, such is their distaste for rural and regional Queensland and such is their lack of comprehension for the importance of water infrastructure to grow the economy of Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government did release the commission of inquiry report into Paradise Dam with 96 hours notice before they sent in the bulldozers to tear down the wall of Paradise Dam. When Queensland Labor finally did release the report, the responsible minister, Minister Lynham, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission heard evidence about a litany of issues with the design and construction, some of which were ultimately found to be root causes of the present-day structural and stability concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The commission found that the design of the primary spillway … was simply not wide enough.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fancy way of saying what we already knew: Peter Beattie and Queensland Labor's commissioning of the Paradise Dam is the biggest infrastructure fail in Australia's history. This is a dam that cost hundreds of millions of dollars and is as useful as a chocolate teapot in Billabong Street in the middle of summer. The people of the Bundaberg-Burnett region were told they were going to get water; that is not happening. They were told that the dam wall would be reduced by five metres. That's also not happening now, because now they have been told it's going to be closer to six meters. What they aren't being told is that there is a plan from the Queensland Labor government to safely return Paradise Dam to full capacity. No-one is denying that the safety and security of the people in the Bundaberg-Burnett region should be guaranteed. But part of that safety and part of that security is ensuring that there is water security for the growing agriculture sector in the Bundaberg-Burnett region. This destruction of the Paradise Dam will be, effectively, a $2.4 billion economic hit to the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you're not going to hear anything from Palaszczuk and you won't hear anything from state Labor about this, because within the DNA of Labor in Queensland is a dislike of anything to do with dams. They don't want to build dams. They don't like dams. We've got a state Labor government in Queensland who aren't building dams and who are actually tearing down the dams that do exist—such is their record. The reason for this is that they are chasing Greens preferences, because those in the Labor Party in Queensland know that the only way they can win the coming state election in 140 or so days is by getting the Greens party preferences, and they know that the Greens party is the tail that wags the dog that is the modern Queensland Labor Party. I call on the Queensland Labor Party to forget about the Greens and to stand up for Queensland, to stand up for dams, to stand up for the community and the Bundaberg-Burnett region, and to restore Paradise Dam to its full height—because the Frecklington-Mander LNP government will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the election on 31 October is so important. We can't afford another four years of Labor mishandling and mismanaging the Queensland economy. We can't afford four years of Palaszczuk hiding in her high-rise, hiding from the voters and hiding from Jackie Trad, because we all know that Jackie Trad has got the numbers in that caucus and will come back and knife Palaszczuk. We can't afford four years of Labor playing games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we need Deb Frecklington and Tim Mander, who are focused on jobs and water security. That's why we've got Deb Frecklington and Tim Mander, who are going to deliver a budget within 100 days, when state Labor in Queensland aren't going to deliver a budget within a year. So the choice is clear: vote 1 LNP.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  I wish to thank my colleague Malarndirri McCarthy for attempting to put the humanity to human beings who otherwise would be numbers on a file. Two weeks ago we observed National Reconciliation Week, but the sad reality, then and now, is that our nation is far from reconciled. Just remember what we witnessed only a fortnight ago. In my home state of Western Australia, a sacred Aboriginal heritage site of world significance was destroyed, followed by an insincere apology by the company; the High Court ruled that the tear gassing of teenagers in the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in Darwin was unlawful; and Black Lives Matter protests erupted here and around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fuelling the protests was the dreadful realisation that, since the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, nearly 440 Aboriginal people have died in custody. Without answers, this breeds fear of foul play being at work. I was one of the six royal commissioners back then, but our report did not support the initial expectation of foul play. A death in custody does not, as a fact, impute guilt or culpability to the officers in attendance or to the institution per se. It does raise the question of what happened when the death occurred and why the person came to be in custody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, tabled our report in May 1991 and noted that the most significant contributor to incarceration was the disadvantage of Aboriginal people in every way, whether socially, economically or culturally. Mr Tickner told the parliament, and the report highlighted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The dispossession and subordination within a dominant and often hostile society frequently motivated self-interest, the development of racist attitudes both overt and hidden and the way in which these attitudes became institutionalised in the very practices of legal, educational, welfare and Aboriginal assistance authorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that hundreds of Aboriginal persons have died in custody since the royal commission diminishes us all as a nation. We must ask ourselves: What are the common themes that drive this continuing subjugation of First Nations? What are the underlying factors through which First Nations people have become destabilised, disempowered and dispossessed? And why have our good intentions and resolve failed to make any difference?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no pride in seeing First Nations people so reduced by societal factors from within and without that they are perceived as exceptional recipients of government largesse, not worthy of restorative justice and denied true equality of opportunity in our society. Why is it so difficult for the descendants of the settler and colonist to have the necessary discussion about uncomfortable truths? The First Nations know the shortfalls in their societies and have been trying to address them for some time, but they will not advance without true partnership and change. Incarceration and out-of-home care for children present questions of moral, ethical and legal substance that go to the heart of our willingness to deal with our relationship and understanding of each other. Deaths in custody is not just about policing and incarceration rates; it goes to the legacy of dispossession and disempowering of First Nations. Subjugation goes to the point of interaction of First Nations and mainstream society manifested in our schools, workplaces, shops, hospitals, real estate agencies and in other places. It is also embedded in the institutions that administer the many services and often in our public institutions. It's in our Constitution. Mr Menzies recognised that in relation to section 51(xxvi), the race power. That is why First Nations want a voice to parliament and at regional and local levels: to stop the subjugation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian racism explains the deep distrust felt by First Nations people towards our institutions and agendas of assimilation and adoption of those. It explains why we are not surprised, but are still outraged, when First Nations people are locked up behind bars, even if they are responsible for breaking the law. Systematically, First Nations people have been treated as inferior and deficient and tolerated through condescension. This has brought subjugation, destabilisation and disempowerment in order for those of non-Indigenous society to remain confident in their positions of privilege and power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission report identified the impact of that exclusion. Commissioner Elliott Johnston, the esteemed Queens Counsel, wrote back then:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations peoples have never ceded their sovereign claims to their lands and waters. They've never entered a treaty on the terms of their subjugation. They remain sovereign peoples. Now more than ever, Australia cannot afford to be unreconciled. We must accept that this nation is in transition, confronted by the necessity of the voice to parliament, constitutional recognition, truth telling and agreement making. We must avoid going down the path of seeing history as a set of competitive narratives and instead work towards the pursuit of truth and respect. We need a political settlement on questions of national independence, integrity, and identity. Two hundred and fifty years of avoiding these fundamental questions has handicapped us as a nation from navigating the complex challenges before us and left us unable to capitalise on the great opportunities of a future together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We feel this confusion in our public discourse, with well-meaning policy objectives failing to meet the expectations of modern multicultural Australia—standards we recognise when crossed but seem unwilling to speak about honestly. We've seen generations of political leaders come and go, blindly touching for a sense of common ground and common identity, without addressing the darkness of dispossession and racism, keeping us chained to the ethnocentric understanding of Australia's identity—one that has never really been true. We have a system unable to understand or celebrate diversity and difference, and First Nations are left to deal with a bureaucratic machine that has often been a tool more of oppression than of liberation. We see this shortcoming in our geospatial engagement with the world. With a new form of imperialism emerging, Australia, without a robust and honest civic identity, simply cannot stand on its own two feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst the culture wars, it's easy to forget that there is a purpose in national reconciliation. It's not a purely academic question. We labour for the cause of reconciliation to seek a political settlement and bring a sense of unity to our Australian project. Indeed, the ceremonial makarrata brings two parties in disagreement to resolve their differences and become as one. We're all the lesser for its absence, whether we're descendants of the First Fleet, migrants or, indeed, First Nations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this pandemic, we've learned a lot about resilience. The nation can learn a lot about resilience from the First Nations people. The path forward has been offered to us through the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The parliament must honour that call and listen to the torment of the powerlessness that continues to haunt this place. Only then will we continue on the path of reconciliation, built on honour, equality, recognition and respect and free from racism.</span>

                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  All lives matter. The majority of the Senate opposed that motion that was put up by me and supported by only one other senator, Malcolm Roberts. All Australians should be treated equally when it involves the delivery of government services and funding. All citizens and residents are equally deserving of services that make our lives better, but there remains a significant imbalance in the funds and services dedicated specifically to those of Aboriginal heritage as opposed to non-Aboriginals. This was a matter that I raised in my maiden speech to the parliament in 1996, and in the ensuing two decades plus there has been little change to the attitude of the government, which continues to throw money at the problem, with virtually no improvement to the lives of those needy Aboriginals. It seems to be a bottomless pit into which money continues to be thrown, but that money has achieved virtually nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If taxpayer funds are spent in a specific area, we are right to expect positive outcomes. As I said in the Senate in February 2020, most Australians know that tens of billions of dollars are spent each year to help alter the standard of living of those in remote Aboriginal communities and even those living in developed parts of Australia. When you spend billions of dollars a year on any group of people, you expect outcomes. Sadly, those billions have gone to the non-productive, unrepentant Aboriginal industry, not to where they should go, the grassroots Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is an industry that has achieved no notable benefits in pulling our First Nations people out of squalor, domestic violence and poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years I have been labelled a racist for my views, mostly by white Australians and those Indigenous people who thrive financially for themselves and their families. I call it the Aboriginal industry. Their agenda is not in the best interest of all Australians, white or black. It's about milking the cow—the taxpayer—crying the victim constantly and blaming whites for a so-called invasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was born in Australia. This is my land. Where the hell do I go? I will not accept the blame game for the so-called invasion you refer to. Your push to change our history books and the false claims that are foisted on our young throughout our education system are disgraceful, all to better suit the Left's agenda. All atrocities must be noted and taught to ensure we acknowledge our past, but, more importantly, to protect our future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not acknowledge or echo the words 'welcome to country' that have been forced on people to say at functions or events. I am very respectful to those who have fought for our freedom and sacrificed their lives for the way of life that we all have the opportunity to enjoy today. I will not support those whose agenda is to divide us as Australians. Wanting a separate nation within a nation at the expense of the Australian taxpayer—this should never happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that I have met over the years, including many elders, have come to understand my honesty and resolve and not the lies they had been fed—mostly by Labor and the Greens, less so by the coalition—to destroy me and stop One Nation from taking their votes. Remember, it was John Howard who disendorsed me as a candidate in 1996 when I called for equality for all Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap report 2020</span> shows just how little improvement has been realised for Aboriginal people, despite the billions spent each year over the past decades. As I have said many times, money alone will not solve the problem. It comes back to determination, discipline and a willingness to make the changes, and that must come primarily from the Aboriginal people themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met recently with a group of strong and focused Aboriginal women from all parts of Australia who are desperate for positive change for their children and their communities. I think it makes sense to allow women to play a bigger role and have a say in the direction taken by initiatives to improve the lives of Aboriginal Australians. These same Aboriginal women and elders say they want the Aboriginal land councils gone or made accountable; they are corrupt and don't represent the needs of the Aboriginal people. There is duplication of Aboriginal services, costing billions of taxpayers' dollars to prop them up, with no review or accountability—why? Members in this place are continually calling for accountability from other government departments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In seven key areas the Closing the Gap initiative has not performed well, with even Prime Minister Scott Morrison admitting the poor results. Poor results will continue in substance abuse, domestic violence, child sexual abuse, education, housing, jobs, health and Aboriginal incarceration if we keep giving excuses, calling them disadvantaged, throwing money at the problems and treating their ineptness as our responsibility, when they have to take responsibility for their own actions. Someone needs to start looking in the mirror. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The child sexual abuse that is committed in Aboriginal communities is an absolute disgrace. Very little is done about it by authorities because they are black and they pull the race and cultural card. Those poor children, and also the women who are bashed and raped—is that the fault of the white man? No. Go to Doomadgee and see the children walking the streets to at night to flee the abuse they receive in their own homes from their own parents and family members. Is that the white man's fault? No. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had a gutful of the bleating from the Greens and others. How many Indigenous people have you had in your homes? Have you fought personally to help an Indigenous woman in prison to get her life on track? Have you been with her seven children in her own home? I very much doubt it. I have. Many in this place are all BS and push their own political agenda without really understanding the implications and ramifications of what they are saying. My research has found that, although the systems and programs may have changed in some ways and perhaps become more complex, there is still an overwhelming imbalance weighing heavily in favour of Aboriginal Australians in services provided in the areas of education, legal services, housing loans, health, royalties for mining operations and employment support services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Are handouts a good thing? Do they help improve the lives and positions of many Aboriginals, particularly those who live in remote areas? To favour any one race in Australia over other races in government support and the provision of services amounts to racist policy and actually prolongs the problems. There are many Australians who would love the handouts and opportunities given to the Indigenous. I might add that many Indigenous are living in very nice housing, are in well paid jobs and are not struggling, but they can apply for educational assistance for their children that many Australians would love for their own children but can't get because of race. Tell me this is not racism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, additional handouts to Aboriginals do not help them. They make them reliant on government and actually prevent them from becoming independent and being able to create new and more fulfilling lives for themselves. We need to encourage Aboriginal people themselves to take control of their communities, to reduce substance use and abuse, to encourage school attendance and education, and to promote discipline and determination in employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of 'Aboriginal' continues to be contentious and unclear in many cases. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies provides an outline of three working criteria for confirming Aboriginality which are usually accepted by government agencies and community organisations. These three criteria are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">identifying as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being accepted as such by the community in which you live, or formerly lived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that the number of those who identify as Aboriginals has increased dramatically in the last 50 years. In 1971 there were officially 115,953 Aboriginals in Australia, or 0.9 per cent. Since that time, we've had an increase of 459 per cent, while the population generally has increased by 83.5 per cent. Some suggest the increase is the result of increased willingness to identify as Aboriginal. It is a matter for further research as to whether the increase is because of the loose definition and the many government benefits available to Aboriginals. I believe it is. To all those struggling Australians wanting equal opportunities for their children and families: tick the box. There is no place in our country for racism or, for that matter, reverse racism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish with a quote from a speech given by Martin Luther King Jr in 1963:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I read with great interest a story in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> titled 'Rates set to fall for most households'. The article states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Chief Minister Andrew Barr will … use his annual "State of the Territory" address to announce rate freezes for about two thirds of home owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows Mr Barr's announcement on Monday that his government will freeze a number of fees and charges at 2019-20 levels, including birth, death and marriage registration, car rego, land title fees and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What these two announcements ignore, and what most of the media coverage has ignored, is that, since Mr Barr embarked on a so-called tax reform package in 2011, he has jacked up rates and charges year on year, putting a massive strain on Canberra households, families and businesses. While Mr Barr claimed at the time that his so-called tax reform package would see rates increase while stamp duty would be abolished, here we are, nearly 10 years down the track, and rates will have more than tripled and stamp duty is still here, still gouging Canberrans. In fact, even with rates tripling, Canberrans paid more than $15 million more in stamp duty in 2019-20 than they did in 2010-11. What do we expect from the Australian Labor Party and their fellow travellers, the Greens? For them, tax reform means only one thing: tax increases. Their philosophy is to tax you back into the Stone Age, and they are merciless in doing so. Is this some sort of road to Damascus conversion from Mr Barr to lower tax? I don't think so. The reality of the situation is that, having jacked up rates, Mr Barr now finds himself staring down the barrel of an election, with many Canberrans fed up with the gouges and the rorts of his government. What we see here is nothing more than a desperate pre-election fix from a desperate chief minister trying to save his job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Barr has form on pre-election fixes. Ahead of the 2016 election, instead of the planned nine per cent increase, Mr Barr decided to be generous and only slug Canberrans with a 4½ per cent increase. This was after having year-on-year increases of around 10 per cent. After the election, he returned to his merry ways and his massive tax gouges. When Senator Gallagher was Chief Minister, Mr Barr was her Treasurer. It was they who embarked on this so-called tax reform—I mean, tax-increase plan. I said at the time that, under ACT Labor, Canberrans' rates would triple within a decade, and, of course, Andrew Barr said that that was a lie. Well, here we are, eight years down the track, and we are well on the way. A decade into Senator Gallagher and Chief Minister Barr's grand tax plan, rates revenue will have increased from $209 million in 2011-12 to $697 million by 2021-22—more than triple. Who's paying for that? Of course, it is ordinary Canberrans. History has proven that it is actually Mr Barr who lied to Canberrans, and he should hang his head in shame. Having lied at the start of this tax plan, how can he be believed now, on the eve of an election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you don't believe me, perhaps you believe former Labor Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who is critical of how Mr Barr and ACT Labor have managed the territory's finances since taking over the top job. I quote from Mr Stanhope:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since releasing the debt genie from its bottle in 2013 net debt in the ACT has "ballooned" to Skywhale proportions. From a position of negative net debt of $736 million in 2011 it has increased in giant leaps, somewhat akin to the cravings of an ice addict for methamphetamine, the more you have the more you need, to a debt of $109 million in 2013; $910 million in 2015; $1.453 billion in 2017 and $2.216 billion in 2019 …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of the situation is that, having jacked rates up every year and increased stamp duty every year, with increasing debt every year, service delivery in the ACT is worse than it has ever been, because the ACT Labor-Greens government is more focused on political grandstanding than getting the basics right. We see this in Mr Barr's chronic underfunding and mismanagement of the ACT health system. Despite Commonwealth funding more than doubling since the coalition came to federal government, Mr Barr has cut hospital funding in real terms year on year. The situation is so egregious that a recent report showed that the ACT has the highest emergency department wait times in the country. Just one in five patients who were classed as 'urgent' was seen within the recommended 30 minutes of presenting themselves. More startling and a figure of real concern is that not even those requiring resuscitation are always seen within the recommended time frame. This is quite an amazing record: jacking up rates, tripling rates in less than a decade, huge tax increases for families and business, yet still delivering record debt and still managing to underfund and mismanage the health system. That is quite the record when you are taking that much tax and still running massive deficits and still delivering such poor services for the people of the ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of the situation is that, under the Barr Labor-Greens government, many Canberrans—working people doing it tough, pensioners and people in lower income households—are locked out of homeownership, lack the essential services they need and are ignored. The Labor-Greens government doesn't even pretend to be committed anymore to affordable housing. And if you haven't got private health insurance, you'll be left waiting years for medical treatment that is essential to your quality of life. Again, Jon Stanhope, the longest serving Chief Minister in the territory's history, has completely lost confidence in Barr's government because it is simply not getting the job done. He says that ordinary Canberrans are:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… abandoned by the Labor Party, ignored by the unions and are invisible to the Greens. Ironically, they now have nowhere left to turn but to Alistair Coe—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who could blame them, indeed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received many representations on the Barr Labor government's rates rorts from my constituents. Here are some of the direct quotes from people in the community:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They mean increased financial stress, having to choose between maternity leave and returning to work early after only 8 weeks, no family holidays, no extracurricular activities for the children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The cost to our budget due to rates is significant. We have to go without to make sure they can be paid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to hurting its own constituents, the disgusting greed of the ACT Labor Government directly damages small businesses and harms the underemployed throughout the territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I feel like a cash cow for Barr Government as they are making up any excuse to get more money. Services in the south are dismal. So money leaves our pockets and we see no return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The rates increases mean I have more difficulty in paying other bills and I have less discretionary funds. Also, what on earth did they spend it on? We have the worst hospital in Australia and dilapidated unmaintained local parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just some of the feedback from the community about this tired, long-serving Labor-Greens government and how much they are letting the people down. Canberra ought to be the best place in the country to live, but Canberrans are being let down by an uncaring, arrogant and incompetent Labor-Greens government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would ask Canberrans not to fall for this pre-election pretence from a government that only ever increases taxes. If we want things to get better in our city, if we want to see real change, then Canberrans need to let their voices be heard at the ballot box in October. Kick out this incompetent Andrew Barr Labor-Greens government and vote for Alistair Coe and the Canberra Liberals.</span>

                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise to talk about the five ways in which this government is sidelining the women workers of Australia during the COVID-19 crisis. This is a government that has had a problem with women workers for a long time, and it's doubled down on that problem in its unequal response to the COVID-19 crisis. Let's see if I can get through my list of the five ways that the government is letting down Australia's women in the few minutes that I have for this statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 1 is the government's backflip on aged-care workers. Eighty-seven per cent of aged-care workers are women. Minister Colbeck promised a retention bonus, which would be paid after tax, to support the low-paid, hardworking aged-care women of Australia. But the government and Senator Colbeck have backflipped and decided that this would be before tax, meaning less going to the aged-care workers, who have been on the front line for so long as essential workers during this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 2 is the government's choice to exclude over a million casual workers from JobKeeper in the first place. We know women are over-represented both in casual jobs and in the sectors that have been hit hard by the shutdown—retail, hospitality, food and accommodation. Women make up 60 per cent of the people who've been excluded due to the government's decision to stop casuals with less than 12 months service from being able to apply for JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 3 is kicking early-childhood educators off JobKeeper. Straight after announcing that JobKeeper would be maintained for Australia's workers, the government decided to target a group of 120,000 women workers and kick them off JobKeeper. These are women who have been working hard and doing everything that the government has asked of them—going to work, performing essential work and keeping the rest of Australia at work. How does the government reward them? By making them the first people it kicks off the JobKeeper program. What an absolute disgrace. What a way to reward that absolutely essential workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 4 is ending free child care while this crisis continues. While the government are busy making women's jobs more uncertain, they're also making it harder for women with families to even be able to return to work. We know that the government's decision to end free child care will have a much larger impact on women, compared to men, and their ability to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 5 is the lack of a jobs package for women workers. What a stand-out record this government already has on supporting women workers! Let's add to that the government's decision to make grants for $150,000 bathroom renovations, with golden toilets and platinum bidets and absolutely no support for the industries that women work in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a problem with women workers. Those opposite broke their promise to aged-care workers, who are mostly women. They excluded over a million casuals from JobKeeper, who are mostly women. They kicked educators off JobKeeper early, who are mostly women. They're ending free child care at an absolutely critical time for the working women of Australia, and, in the meantime, they've announced no real support for the working women of Australia during this crisis.</span>

We have now recovered that lost ground in consumer confidence, and the Westpac and ANZ indices both tell us that the high-frequency spending data shows that that's being increasingly translated into increased retail sales. Those opposite mention work areas which have a high proportion of women working in them. That includes hospitality and retail, and we know that the good news for those women and young people who work in both of those areas, for example, is that they will be early benefiters from the reopening process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm pleased to inform the Senate that later today Australia and the United Kingdom will officially commence negotiations towards a free trade agreement between our two countries. This is a great step forward in terms of creating new opportunities that will lead to new and further job opportunities for Australians. The UK is already our seventh largest trading partner, and our total two-way trade is worth more than $30 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can do much more than that. We are seeking an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement that secures commercially meaningful market access for our farmers and businesses and across the services sectors as well as for goods, and further strengthens our two-way investment flows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK is Australia's third-largest services trading partner. In 2019, our two-way services trade was worth in excess of $15 billion. We want to make sure that, across financial services, professional services, telecommunications, fintech and emerging sectors, we enhance and strengthen those opportunities. The UK is already our second-largest source of foreign investment in Australia, with foreign direct investment valued at $127 billion in 2019. We see exciting investments, such as by British based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in its $200 million manufacturing facility in North Ryde in Sydney. We know that, when the UK entered the European Economic Community in 1973, our agriculture exports suffered the worst. At that stage, the UK was our third-largest goods trading partner; it is now our 12th. Tariffs on agricultural products account for 67 per cent of all tariffs the UK applies to Australian exports. We seek to eliminate as many of these as possible to create new opportunities for our farmers and our businesses to grow more jobs through the relationship. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Whether it's across Senator Abetz's home state of Tasmania or my state of South Australia or any part of our great country, there are so many Australians who rely upon trade and market access to sustain their employment and their jobs. It's estimated that, through our trade growth over recent years, more than 240,000 trade related jobs have been created across Australia. And, despite the challenges of the pandemic, we have seen trade volumes hold up very strongly in so many of our key markets. We know there are more Australian businesses exporting and we know from analysis that Australian household incomes are higher as a result of those trading relationships. This is all about making sure that we continue to post the record trade surpluses we have off the back of record exports and, in doing so, create more job opportunities for people right across Australia.</span>

It is why, whilst we are pleased to be launching negotiations with the United Kingdom, we're also determined to conclude negotiations with the European Union, such a significant and valuable partner for us. We're looking to make sure we grow those opportunities across all of those EU nations, which have a population and potential consumer base for Australia of more than 400 million people. We have just completed our seventh round of negotiations with the EU, doing so through virtual organisations and formats, making sure we continue to make real progress to deliver the type of comprehensive relationship that can create more job opportunities for Australians and mutually beneficial outcomes for our nations.</span>

Why is the government making parents choose between food and care during Australia's first recession in 29 years?</span>

I am not familiar with the group that Senator Bilyk referred to. I think it is important to be clear here about the response that the government has worked through, which is something that's never been done before. Australian families were indeed facing a crisis that was unprecedented. We took an important and temporary measure to help Australian families get through the crisis. We are supporting the childcare sector to keep it strong and to keep its workers employed, both of which are fundamental to any provision of any childcare at all. We also know, as those opposite have raised, that we have seen women do an even more disproportionate share of unpaid caring and domestic work, and that's an issue that we believe needs to be addressed irrespective of COVID-19. We know that working or returning to work needs access to child care. </span>

Parents were also reporting, and I have said this in the chamber before in response to other questions, that they couldn't access the level of care that they needed, into the future, under the relief package as it stood. But we don't believe and we don't agree with those opposite on a number of the points that they have made. Parents who are able to afford to pay for child care, of course, will continue to be expected to do that. That is how the system works. But there are always those, as Senator Bilyk has pointed out, who face further challenges, those who cannot afford it because of— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Importantly, in the context of this process, we have also established a transition payment, as it is described. That was the choice between having an ongoing JobKeeper or a 25 per cent subsistence payment to the sector. We are talking about the same amount of support in that context, but it does mean that more employees are able to be helped, and in the consultations that government had with the sector that was seen as the better way forward. So that transition payment of 25 per cent of childcare services fees revenue will continue to support the sector through to 27 September. In fact, it puts $708 million back into the sector as it moves back to the childcare subsidy system. What we have said to providers is that in order to receive the transition payment providers will need to guarantee employment levels to protect staff as they move off JobKeeper. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I want to be very clear: in terms of continued additional support for families who need it, we are providing a safety net in the form of an additional childcare subsidy for families in financial difficulty. Those families can still receive free care for a maximum of 100 hours per fortnight. The additional childcare subsidy for families transitioning from jobseeker back to work. We are easing the activity test until 4 October to help families whose employment has been affected. They will receive subsidised care as they return to work and study and training. So to ensure the viability of the sector, to ensure that child care can actually be accessed, this is a very important process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I have mentioned in this chamber on a number of occasions in the last few weeks, the coronavirus supplement that was made available to people who were on working-age payments at the start of the coronavirus pandemic was put in place for the period of the pandemic. We made it very clear at the time that all of the measures that we put in place, not just the coronavirus supplement, were time limited, they were timely and they were to be targeted to make sure that we were able to help as many Australians as we possibly could get from where they were at the time with the pandemic—and the implications of the pandemic on the economy and on their employment prospects—to the other side of the pandemic. </span>

But, over recent days, we are now starting to see the economy opening up again. We are seeing restrictions able to be lifted. We are seeing jobs being created again in the marketplace. In fact, today we were pleased to report that we are starting to see the earliest of green shoots, with increased job creation, above the levels of job creation we had actually anticipated. </span>

Has the government done any modelling on the expected rate of mortgage defaults and the number of renters who will be in housing stress in October if the rate does go back to $40 a day? If not, why not? If so, what are the details, please?</span>

In fact, I'm sure there has not been a government in the world that has had to confront this probably since the Second World War. Obviously, as we work our way forward to deal with all of the challenges that are before us, as we get our economy back on track and get it onto a stable footing, we'll be looking at many things, and we will continue to monitor as we become further aware of the impacts of this crisis. We will continue to work with all of the sectors around Australia. The Prime Minister continues to work with his state and territory counterparts through the continuation of the national cabinet to make sure that we are in the best possible position on the other side of the coronavirus pandemic to ensure that we can continue to support all Australians in their lives.</span>

Clearly you haven't been listening to what we have been saying in this place, what Senator Cormann said in response to many of the questions that he has been asked this week. The most important thing that we can do is get the economy back open again so that we can get people back into work. The other thing, Senator Siewert, that you failed to recognise in your original question when you referred to the $40 a day is the myriad of other supports and payments that are particularly targeted to people. For instance, anybody who has got children obviously is eligible to receive the full amount of the family tax benefit part A and part B. Those people that you refer to who are in rental accommodation are obviously eligible to be in receipt of Commonwealth rental assistance. And there are a myriad of other payments that are made available to make sure that our welfare system targets the specific needs of individuals who require the support of the federal government.</span>

Senator McDonald has a very strong understanding of the importance of overseas markets to our rural and regional communities and the businesses that exist within them. It is quite an astonishing statistic that 70 per cent of Australia's agricultural production is exported. Therefore, access to a diverse range of overseas markets is very important to Australia, and it has never been more important than it is now, with the economic challenges that Australia faces with the coronavirus pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a very strong record in delivering market access and opportunities to all of our Australian industries but particularly to our farmers and fishers. Today, I'm very pleased to be in the Senate with my colleague the Minister for Trade, Minister Birmingham, on the cusp of embarking on new free trade agreement negotiations with the United Kingdom. In the UK—and in the EU, where negotiations are already underway—there is enormous opportunity to deliver ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreements, securing more favourable access for Australian products into these new markets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands that it's not just about new markets for our agricultural sector; we also need to make sure that our industries know exactly how they can best take advantage of these new markets. We don't take a 'set and forget' approach. So, through a series of 12 webinars, Austrade will ensure that exporters have all of the information that they need so that they can take the steps that they need to take to take the most advantage of the free trade agreements. Australia's free trade agreements with key trading partners continue to deliver huge benefits for Australia.</span>

So growth in Australian exports to premium markets is absolutely vital for the future of our agricultural sector, and maintaining strong relationships with our trading partners is absolutely critical to that success. Australian businesses that export, you will be interested to know, on average hire 23 per cent more staff, they pay 11 per cent higher wages and they have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. These are industries that are leading Australia. So trade is a very major contributor to our economy, it's a major creator of jobs and it has a positive impact on our ability to pay for the essential services that all Australians rely on. It is absolutely essential that we get these free trade agreements in place.</span>

Just last week, we implemented the new farm household allowance program to make sure that we can assist our farmers to put food on the table and help them through what has been a very a crippling drought in our agricultural areas. We've also invested in rural financial counselling services so farmers can get the advice they need when they need it to make sure that they can make the best possible decisions to ensure their longevity and that they are able to get into the export markets that Senator Birmingham is about to open up for them.</span>

The Australian government is committed to our farmers.</span>

This government, I think quite wisely, made provision to support senior Australians—when there were issues at the supermarkets, when there were issues with senior Australians being able to get out—to be able to access support that they might require. We put in place a range of measures that supported senior Australians to be able to get the services that they required. In fact, I'm pleased that not so many people needed to have emergency food supplies provided to them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do know that a number of the other measures that we put in place to assist senior Australians, to provide food, to provide meals, were extremely successful. For example, in some areas the number of people receiving Meals on Wheels services increased by 50 per cent. That was another of the elements that we put in place to assist senior Australians that were having problems getting food. We made provision for what we estimated might be required by senior Australians under that particular program. Senior Australians were freely able to apply for the food boxes. It was a demand-driven process. The fact that we did not need to send out those boxes, I think, shows the success of many of the other measures that we put in place, including the extraordinary additional support that's been provided to senior Australians through programs like Meals on Wheels, who have, as I said, in some places had up to a 50 per cent increase in demand and service provision.</span>

We made provision for a service if people needed it. The fact is that the demand hasn't been what we thought it might have been, and it's a good thing that people have been able to get the food without having to rely on emergency relief packages. I think it's a good thing. It's also, as I've said, a demonstration of the fact that a range of measures that included additional capacity of over $50 million into Meals on Wheels has been a significant success, because Meals on Wheels provides a number of other things than just delivery of a food package. It provides human contact. It provides a capacity to be in touch with the outside world. I am not at all disappointed at the fact that the demand hasn't been what we thought it might have been. I don't regard it as a failure to make a promise. I regard it as a success in providing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Davey, like all of us in the Morrison government, understands it is critical to put in place policies to support small and family businesses in Australia. Why? Because, when it comes to rural and regional Australia, they well and truly are the backbone of those communities. They give back to those communities. They support local jobs. They support local charities. And of course they support the local sporting organisations. This support has only been made even more important because of the impacts of COVID-19, the impacts of the bushfires and the impacts of the drought on our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a strong record of supporting small and family businesses across Australia, including fast-tracking tax relief for small and medium businesses, because we understand that the money that we gave back to them—which was their own money—they were able to invest back into their business to grow that business and create more jobs. We've also, as you know, improved access to finance for those businesses so that they can access the money that they need, again, to grow their business and to create more jobs. We're also ensuring that small businesses are paid on time through our own government policies—leading by example, of course—but also in the implementation of the payment times reporting framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, the government's side of the chamber, we're absolutely committed to cutting red tape and supporting small businesses with advice in disputes with the ATO and big business. In the wake of COVID-19, we have put in place targeted measures to support small businesses. The government's funding boost today of the Export Market Development Grants scheme acknowledges the importance of ensuring that small businesses have the opportunity to develop their ability to get into export markets.</span>

Senator Davey might remember the implementation of the Australian apprentice wage subsidy, a very successful measure which of course provides wage subsidies for apprentices in areas of skill shortage, in particular in rural and regional Australia. That wage subsidy was actually opposed by those on the Labor side of politics. It was quite bizarre, actually. One would've thought they would've supported that measure. It was targeted at creating opportunities for small and family businesses to take on apprentices in particular areas of need and in rural and regional Australia. But at the time it was famously called by those on the Labor side of the chamber a 'political fiasco'. Well, no, it wasn't a political fiasco. It was a policy that was implemented specifically to support businesses in rural and regional Australia.</span>

It is critical that we put in place policies that will support them through this crisis and enable them to come out the other side and prosper, grow and, ultimately, create more jobs for Australians. There are around 3.5 million small businesses in Australia. They give the dignity of work every day and they employ over six million Australians. When you come from rural or regional Australia, as so many on this side of the chamber do, you acutely understand that these businesses are the backbone of the local economy, they are the ones out there supporting local jobs, they are the ones out there supporting local charities and they are the ones you often see supporting local sporting organisations. It is incredibly important that we put in place the right policies, as we are doing, to support these businesses so they can prosper, grow and create more jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In 2018, Minister Littleproud said he was shocked and gutted by footage of thousands of suffering sheep being cooked alive aboard the live export ship <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. All of Australia was shocked and appalled by this unspeakable cruelty to animals which has been going on for decades. While the government refuses to shut down live animal exports, it did implement a ban on live sheep exports to the Northern Hemisphere during summer months because of the excruciating suffering that heat stress inflicts. Now that you've made a mockery of your own rules by granting an exemption to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Kuwait</span>, a ship scheduled to leave Fremantle today, I ask: why did the government bother instituting new rules for live exports if it had no intention of enforcing them?</span>

Firstly, the Australian government takes its responsibility for animal welfare, particularly in our farming sector, very, very seriously. As you'd be aware, the decision was made by the Federal Court to allow the <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Kuwait</span> to load and sail. I'd also like to point out to you that there is an independent observer aboard that ship who will sail with that voyage all the way to its destination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter you are referring to is one that we take very seriously. There are in place very, very strict rules and guidelines around the export of live animals from this country. You rightly pointed out the footage we saw last year—and I think everyone in Australia was absolutely disgusted at that footage. That's why this government has worked absolutely tirelessly with the industry, with the sector, with people who have an interest in the welfare of animals, to make sure our live export trade is done in a matter that is absolutely world's best practice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I would be correct in saying that Australia's live export trade and the animal welfare conditions that we expect all our farmers to undertake are seen around the world as the best practice. Through our demonstration of best practice, we like to think we are encouraging other countries around the world to undertake best practice as well and, in doing so, increase the level of animal welfare protections that are in place for all animals around the world. But we will not destroy our Australian agriculture sector by an ideological pursuit when we have put in place very, very strict conditions.</span>

So I think that the Australian government, through the independence of the Department of Agriculture's role in being the inspector, have put in place a set of conditions that ensure that Australia's live exports are governed under the very strictest of conditions. The fact that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Kuwait</span> has been able to load today is a reflection that the Federal Court viewed the provisions that have been put in place by the Department of Agriculture as being adequate to protect the welfare of those animals on board that ship.</span>

The Australian government is absolutely committed to upholding the absolutely very high standards of animal welfare while supporting a sustainable live export trade. It is very important that we get the balance right on animal welfare—an absolute priority—and jobs for Australians, particularly rural and regional jobs for rural and regional Australia and the economies and the regional communities that rely upon them.</span>

So maybe think about what you're saying, because right now we are absolutely committed to the highest level of animal welfare, and we will continue to be so, whilst providing jobs.</span>

In what has been described as a 'rare public speech' last night at the ANU, the foreign minister finally acknowledged the issue of foreign state backed disinformation in Australia. The risks of foreign state backed disinformation have been known for many years, given, for example, the occurrences in Crimea in 2014, the US in 2016 and Hong Kong last year. Can the minister explain why it has taken the government until now to finally act?</span>

As you know, the Prime Minister instituted the multilateral audit and asked my Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry out that audit. Part of that process has meant examining over 100 multilateral institutions, processes and fora, and that has underpinned everything that we have done. What the audit findings have shown us is the value of focusing on our national interest and ensuring that, in doing so, we work within the appropriate systems to achieve outcomes for Australia in our national interest, which should always be the premise upon which—</span>

As I was trying to say in my response to her first question, very, very clearly, when the Prime Minister talked at the Lowy Institute he talked about prosecuting a case for our national interests, including through multilateral institutions. He instituted the multilateral audit and asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry it out. That audit has been absolutely comprehensive. What it shows us is that Australia has a very important role to play in shaping the values and the norms within multilateral institutions themselves. We are talking about institutions that are extremely important to Australia in terms of advancing our national interest and promoting and protecting our values. Whether they are underpinning the global rules and norms that ensure a level playing field, whether they are regulating international cooperation in areas like aviation, telecommunications, maritime transport, intellectual property and a range of others— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Morrison government's $200 billion investment in defence capability provides unprecedented opportunities for Australian companies—and, let me tell everybody in this chamber, they are embracing these opportunities in record numbers. Thanks to the policies of those on this side of the chamber, global defence companies are establishing uniquely Australian entities that are today employing thousands and thousands of Australians and are exporting Australian-built cutting-edge capability to the world. I'm so proud of companies like Thales Australia, of French origin, which is now employing almost 4,000 Australians. They are now delivering for Australia and also now exporting high-technology products for defence, including the Bendigo-built Bushmasters. Another wonderful example is the 50 Australian companies, such as Chemring Australia, just outside of Geelong, who are now exporting over $1.7 billion of— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Let me be very clear. The Attack class submarine is on time and it is on budget, Senator Sterle. In the current preliminary design phase, we are starting to select many of the systems and the future suppliers. As Naval Group Australia approaches industry, it is a mandatory requirement for Australian industry plans to be developed as they approach the Australian market. This will ensure that we are maximising Australian industry content—a minimum of 60 per cent. To ensure we are developing our sovereign knowledge base, we already have over a hundred Australians working in Cherbourg, in France, including 20 of Naval Group Australia's 200 employees. As this project ramps up, I am absolutely confident Naval Group Australia will succeed in ensuring that its presence in Australia generates thousands of multigenerational jobs and, in time, more defence exports.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. Mr President, I've written to you in relation to an answer I gave to a question from Senator Watt yesterday in relation to bushfire relief. I stated that about $1.4 billion worth of bushfire response and recovery funding is already hitting the ground in communities. To clarify my answer, most of this $1.4 billion in funding comes from our $2 billion National Bushfire Recovery Fund—around $1 billion of it, in fact, as I've previously stated. This, of course, includes funding that represents our share of the debris clean-up, which will be reimbursed to the state government in accordance with standard arrangements. The clean-up is well underway, as I also outlined yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as the Prime Minister always said, the $2 billion fund was in addition to the response and recovery funding that the Commonwealth already funds under standard disaster recovery arrangements. Around $400 million of the $1.4 billion I referenced as already hitting the ground is part of those standard disaster recovery arrangements with Commonwealth funds. The fact remains that we have over $1.4 billion in federal funding in response to the bushfire crisis hitting the ground in affected communities, and this is assisting those communities now. I hope that that clarifies the answer provided yesterday, and I table the letter.</span>

                  </a>  That's all I need. As I was saying, I thank Minister Cormann for the statement that he just made there, but unfortunately, again, we've seen in that statement from Minister Cormann three hallmarks of this government from him and from the Prime Minister: misrepresentations of their previous statements, getting basic figures wrong and being loose with the truth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just remind people what this concerns. Yesterday I asked Minister Cormann a number of questions about the pathetic efforts of this government in relation to bushfire recovery. In answer to the questions that I asked, the minister claimed:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">in the National Bushfire Recovery Fund—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">is already hitting the ground in communities</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wasn't surprised that the minister made that comment, because this is one of the misrepresentations that this government is consistently making in relation to bushfire recovery. The truth is that the Prime Minister announced a $2 billion Bushfire Recovery Fund in January this year. The government's own figures, which were tabled about a week or so ago, indicate that only $529 million of that $2 billion fund has been spent. The government then tries to include another $470 million or so that it will be spending in the future on things like debris removal and tries to say that it has therefore spent a billion dollars from the $2 billion fund, even though it has actually spent only $529 on its own figures. Then, to be a little bit more cheeky, it throws in another $400 million of grants and loans that have been made to bushfire victims, as occurs after every single disaster that this country faces. That extra $400 million has nothing whatsoever to do with the $2 billion Bushfire Recovery Fund, which, as I say, on the government's own figures, has spent only $529 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was a little disappointed when I got Senator Cormann's letter today, where he says that what he said yesterday was that about $1.4 billion worth of bushfire response and recovery funding is already hitting the ground. If that were what he had said yesterday, there wouldn't have been a need for me to write to him. But the truth is that that is not what he said yesterday. What he said yesterday in answer to the question I asked was that $1.4 billion of funding out of the $2 billion fund is being spent. That is simply not true and I think it would have been preferable for him to be honest in his answer in the letter that he provided to the Senate today and to admit that he got it wrong. It is very disappointing that we see this minister misrepresent his previous statements. It is yet another example of him and this government getting their figures wrong—anyone remember the $60 billion JobKeeper bungle? I think I remember that one! This minister does have a problem with numbers—he didn't get them from Peter Dutton, either! Again, they are being loose with the truth.</span>

                  </a>  I rise to follow Senator Watt's comments and just make this point. When you have the Leader of Government in the Senate being loose with the truth in question time, being given the opportunity to come in here and demonstrate the accountability that our democracy demands from ministers, to demonstrate as the leader—the examples to his frontbenchers—what do we get? We get more measly words, more tricky words—a bit loose with the truth—and he doesn't fess up to the fact that he got it wrong. We would have more regard for ministers on that side if they were actually prepared to come in here and say, 'I correct the record'. That's what democracy requires. But even from Senator Cormann, who otherwise is generally somebody who does understand this democratic principle, we get more words where he's saying, 'I didn't actually say that,' when we know he did. In the same question time we have Senator Colbeck refusing to acknowledge what 'after tax' means. We have Senator Reynolds saying that a change from three to five days isn't a change. This is a mockery. What it demonstrates is the rot at the top of the Morrison government, where the Prime Minister is loose with the truth. You're all being infected by it and you are bringing it into question time, which is a travesty of what it should be in our democracy. Senator Cormann, you should be ashamed of yourself and you should have fronted up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Women (Senator Payne) to questions without notice asked by Senators Pratt and Bilyk today relating to the economic impacts of COVID-19 on women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions asked of the Minister for Women, Senator Payne, today were going to issues around women, and particularly the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on women and some of the particular issues that are being drawn to the attention of all of us. Many of us knew these previously, but I think the coronavirus pandemic has shone a torch not only on the value of women's work but also on some of the disadvantages that women experience in the labour market. We know that women have lower participation rates and lower earnings and that they have lost more jobs—in April alone, I think 500,000 people lost their jobs and 55 per cent were women. We know that more women feature in the underemployment figures and that, in terms of lost hours of work, women experience a greater loss. We also know that women are over-represented or disproportionately represented in industries that have been smashed by the coronavirus restrictions—food, retail, entertainment and accommodation. We know that women are over-represented in insecure work and in work that pays lower incomes. All of these areas have been hit hard by the coronavirus restrictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the value of women's work, women are and have featured prominently in the essential frontline workers—nurses, healthcare workers, early childhood educators, teachers and aged care workers: 87 per cent of nurses and midwives are women; 87 per cent of aged care workers are women; and 96 per cent of early childhood educators are women. We have relied on these roles to keep the community cared for. In retail, in supermarkets, as cleaners, again, you will see more women than men. Key jobs that perhaps have not been recognised for their value have been shown to be so important during the coronavirus pandemic. The Minister for Women told us that the Prime Minister and the government acknowledged the disproportionate impact that the coronavirus pandemic and the consequential restrictions that were put in place have had on women. That admission from the government begs the next question: if that's the case, why are they making decisions that have a harsher impact on women? I'll come back to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the issues is the way they have designed programs such as JobKeeper to exclude people that might have more than one job and be working in highly casualised industries with high turnover. That will exclude women. We know that women are doing more of the caring and unpaid work at home, taking on the added responsibilities of caring for children and perhaps elderly parents. That has come to hit women hard as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HomeBuilder is another example. The government has ignored Treasury advice around social housing and the benefits of that. We know 62 per cent of tenants in social and public housing are women. We know that more women require social housing. This government, in its response on the housing front, has ignored that very important area. Addressing that would also bring broader benefits to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there's child care. Why was child care the first industry that was kicked off JobKeeper? With the snapback—the fiscal cliff—that's coming in September, why was it child care that was removed, if we're trying to get women back to work? We know child care remains one of the biggest barriers to women's full participation in the labour force, and yet this government chose to remove free child care and kick the workers off JobKeeper, putting in place a transition arrangement which the minister acknowledges is less than what they were getting before. That is going to disproportionately affect women.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I'm very pleased to join the debate in terms of the Labor Party's question time tactics. I want to focus on Senator Pratt's question. As we reflect on the current state of play, as we reflect on last year's federal election and we think about how out of touch the Labor Party are, as was demonstrated again by the Australian people overwhelmingly rejecting them, we think about the kinds of issues and attacks that the Labor Party launches on the government, which demonstrate how out of touch they are. Senator Pratt's questioning, attacking Minister Michael Sukkar, an outstanding minister in this government doing an outstanding job, reminds us just how out of touch Labor are, attacking a program that is designed to support tens of thousands of jobs in the construction industry. The attack is: 'There are a lot of men who work in construction.' That appears to be Labor's attack when it comes to the construction industry. If you want an example of why they continue to sit on the opposition benches, perhaps we can reflect on their disdain for the housing industry and their inability to look beyond the very, very important issues in the housing industry. Their critique now about the HomeBuilder program, a program that's so important to so many Australians, is: 'Well, a lot of men work in the construction industry.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll come back to some of those issues, but I'd like to compare and contrast that approach with Minister Sukkar and the coalition government, in terms of being in touch with the electorate and the community. I'm reminded that Bill Shorten actually launched his 2019 campaign in the seat of Deakin, which is Minister Sukkar's electorate. Labor were coming to get him, because they had a plan which the people in the outer suburbs of Melbourne were going to embrace. They were going to make so many gains in Victoria. Why were they going to make those gains? It was because the Labor Party had a plan that reflected the values of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about what some of those plans were. Central to their election prospects, which of course the people overwhelmingly rejected, was Labor's housing tax. There they were in question time again today attacking a scheme that defends jobs in the construction industry simply because there are too many men in the construction industry. What did Labor want to do to the construction industry? They wanted to gut the construction industry. One of the reasons that Labor were rejected at the last election was their housing tax. Just reflect for a moment on where we would be if the Labor Party had come into government and implemented that housing tax ahead of the COVID crisis and the hit to the economy we have had. They would have had the absolute double whammy of being whacked from pillar to post. I'm reminded about how seriously they are taken on some of these issues by Tim Richardson, who says he's concerned about federal Labor's intervention because they've won one election in the last 25 years. Maybe it's because of policies like the housing tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor talk a big game on women, but, when it comes to actually acting, we've had the record in terms of women's workforce participation. We have delivered in a way that the Labor Party couldn't. Almost 900,000 jobs were created for women by the coalition. I'm reminded of what the Labor Party voted against in their protection racket for the CFMEU and the misogynous thugs in the CFMEU. They say, 'Now we're acting on John Setka.' In 2015 they voted against a motion that simply condemned Luke Collier for abusing female FWBC inspectors. Shaun Reardon made threatening late night phone calls to a female staff member of the building industry watchdog. A CFMEU official spat at a female inspector when she was called out to the work site to inspect a union blockade. They talk a big game. We've seen it in Victoria this week. As soon as you go beneath the underbelly, as soon as you go beneath the veneer, we see what they actually do, and they're on the record here defending the CFMEU, excusing their disgraceful behaviour. We're not going to be lectured to by this mob on the other side.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Well, for 2,509 days, this backward-looking government, as exemplified by the last contribution, has completely failed women. While we live in hope that they might stop phoning it in from the 1950s, there is no indication that anything has changed during the most serious period we've been through economically, the first recession in 29 years, while we have been dealing with COVID-19. They have failed mothers by snapping back to a childcare system that is expensive and complex. They have failed older women, leaving them to face poverty and homelessness in retirement. They have failed young women in insecure and low-paying jobs by making so many of them ineligible for JobKeeper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what those opposite think in their hearts about working women. They think that women's economic lives don't matter and that they would be better served in the home, as we heard from Senator Rennick just this week. But, unlike so many of those opposite, we don't hanker for a world where women are locked at home behind white picket fences. Unlike Senator Seselja, we don't think that women's and men's interests stand in opposition to one another; we think that both ought to be considered and that this is an absolute imperative in the public policy debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor want something more for Australian women. We want our daughters and our nieces to have every opportunity. We want them paid what they're worth on the day that they enter the workforce and every day subsequently. We want them to retire in dignity. If they decide to have children, we want them supported to combine a career with their parenting responsibilities. Is any of this at all laid out in any way in the government's plan for women or for the response to COVID-19? We wouldn't know very much, because the government rarely talks about women. Indeed, invited to do so today, we've just had five minutes from Senator Seselja where he could barely find it in himself to even mention the word. They show almost no interest in the economic lives of women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising, in some ways, that their policy settings have so little to offer Australian women when we think about the government's Expenditure Review Committee, which is comprised entirely of men. There is not a single woman sitting in that most important decision-making body. I recall on one occasion when I raised the issue of the unfair impact of tax arrangements on Australian women, then Treasurer Morrison responded with the patronising reply, 'We don't have pink forms and blue forms at tax time,' and that there was no need to consider the impact of their tax proposals on Australian women. The Liberal men of ERC may think that women's economic lives are a joke. I can tell you that that is not how we see our lives. Survey after survey indicates that women want so much more. Tragically, the first thing they want is respect—respect in the workplace and, I dare say, they'd like some respect from their representatives here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 period would have been a good opportunity for the Liberals to change direction, to come to grips with the very great differences between men and women's economic lives and the need for a policy that responds to the lives of women. The ABS has released data showing women have lost jobs since March at 1.3 times the rate that men have lost jobs, but we don't see any specific response to that or any indication that it matters. Part-time work and casual employment can be conveniently flexible, but often the result is that women are taking these jobs so they can balance their work and family lives. When it came to designing a response in COVID-19, what did the government do? They constructed JobKeeper in such a way that so many people in casual work were excluded, and so many of them were women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity now to create something better. We don't want a snapback to an unfair world for women. We don't want a snapback to a world where women earn 14 per cent less than men. We don't want to snap back to a world where women retire with 47 per cent of the super balances of men. We don't want to snap back to a world where women's career possibilities are constrained because child care is not available or affordable. We don't want a snapback to one of the most gendered labour markets in the world. This crisis presents a perfect opportunity to actually build something better for Australian women, and it's a shame the government appears entirely uninterested. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Senator O'Neill, we should be used to it at this point. In the face of an unprecedented economic and health crisis, we've seen from this government a comprehensive response across the economy. What we get from the Labor Party is the usual politics of identity, politics of division. They cherrypick some information. They spin it in a particular way. They choose their dataset very carefully. They ignore the overall economy. They ignore the comprehensive measures that this government has put in place to underpin our economy, to underpin economic growth, to get the economy moving again, to get Australians back in work, to get all Australians back participating in the workforce, to get small business back up and running, to protect our families, to give people a chance to be the best they can possibly be. We get this politics of identity, this cherrypicking of information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Absolutely, I will knowledge that the ABS stats show that women in the workforce were impacted very, very hard by the crisis that confronts this government. But does the Labor Party ever raise the fact that the latest ABS stats also show that jobs for women recovered at 1.4 per cent whereas jobs for men only recovered at 0.4 per cent. Do you ever talk about the identity politics of that? Of course you don't, because it doesn't fit into your narrative. It doesn't fit into this politics of identity that you are seeking to continually drive. Senator Seselja rightly pointed out that almost 900,000 jobs were created for women by this government in the six years before the coronavirus impacted our economy so remarkably and with such great venom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a strong and proud record of supporting women's participation in the labour market. Prior to COVID-19, the March 2020 labour force figures showed near record high employment of women in the economy—almost 6.2 million women employed in the Australian economy. The labour participation rate for women is at an almost record high of 61.3 per cent, 2½ percentage points higher than when the coalition took office in September 2013. From September 2013 until just prior to COVID-19 impacting our economy, almost 900,000 jobs were created for women. Does the Labor Party ever quote these sorts of statistics? Of course they don't. They're too busy playing the politics of identity, the politics of division, and cherrypicking information to suit their particular narrative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Labour Force Survey figures show that seasonally adjusted employment for women fell by 325,000. Of course, this is the impact of the COVID crisis. This is an impact across the economy that this government is only too well aware of and is seeking to comprehensively address. Let me give you one more example. Today Minister Birmingham talked about the need to open our borders to get the tourism and hospitality sector up and running again. That will disproportionately impact, in the positive, women—because women are a greater percentage of the workforce in that particular sector. Does that factor into Labor's narrative? Did they come out in support of Minister Birmingham? Did they jump up and down and congratulate him for his words at The Press Club? Of course not—because, again, it doesn't fit into their narrow world view. We want to get the whole Australian economy—we want to support all Australian working families—out of this economic and health crisis and get the economy back up and running again as quickly as we possibly can.</span>

COVID-19 is an experience that many of us could not have imagined and the burden of care has fallen heavily on the women of this nation. I am proud to be an Australian woman in the Labor Party. There are many of us. We are varied and we are very different. We bring our perspectives to this place in many, many more numbers than you guys. On this side of the chamber, we've got a few more women here in the Senate. But you couldn't line up one woman today to stand up to answer our questions about women being affected by COVID.

                  </a>  I've heard of mansplaining, but I think we've got 'man-interrupting' going on here against a woman speaking her mind, an Australian Labor woman speaking to the reality of Australian women who are at this very time making decisions in one critical by-election in the seat of Eden-Monaro. They've got a choice between sending another bloke to Canberra like this lot or sending a great woman in the shape of Kristy McBain, and I encourage them to do that. The problem with this government is that it simply does not listen to the voices of women and it does not understand the challenges of being a woman in Australia and, if its members are going to call being a woman in Australia and standing up for women 'identity politics', then they need to go back and learn a few understandings about what identity politics actually is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Ley in the other place declared that women have been hardest hit through COVID-19. And what I'm worried about, as an Australian woman standing up for women impacted, is that this government has lined up a set of policies by which we are set to snap back to unaffordable child care. Right around this country, women are talking to me. They're talking to their partners. They're sitting at dining room tables figuring out how much they can actually manage in terms of putting food on the table or paying for child care because this government has so mismanaged the whole childcare sector. They are dudding aged-care workers, not providing them with the promised money that they announced. We see this time and time again: a series of announcements from this government and then a failure to deliver. They're taking away from childcare workers. They are refusing paid parental leave. These are the priorities of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis—in response to great, passionate advocacy by the unions of this country, the big businesses of this country and the Labor Party, and when we begged and pleaded with this government to provide wage subsidies—it finally came through with jobseeker. Yes, they came through with it, but who did they take it away from first? They took it away from the women of Australia. They took it away from the childcare workers, the most female dominated industry in this country. Women in Australia need to remember that this government does not stand up for them. The Liberal-National government have failed Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter of international record. In the World Economic Forum's <span style="font-style:italic;">The G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lobal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ender </span><span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap </span><span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2013</span>, Australia was 23rd in the rankings in terms of women's economic capacity. After seven years of this blokey dominated LNP government that's out of touch with the women of Australia, the reality now is that we've slipped all the way down to 44th of 153 countries. And after what the government has done in response to COVID, I have no expectation that our position will rise. In fact, I'm sure it will get even worse. We know that this government has failed Australian women. As the Labor Party, we are very concerned that child care will not be accessible to women, that they won't be able to get back to work and that there will be barriers to their participation in the economy and the society. We are concerned that Scott Morrison's snapback will actually be a job crusher for the women of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer is: yes, the government is still intending to drop jobseeker back to the old base rate of $40 a day. And when I asked whether they had done any projections or modelling on the expected mortgage defaults, the answer, obviously, was no, because the minister filibustered that question and did not adequately answer it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who thinks realistically that the 1.64 million people that are unemployed in this country and receiving jobseeker—that was the last answer we got on the number of people at the COVID select committee—are all going to be employed by the end of September when jobseeker ends? I bet you no-one thinks that all those people are going to be getting jobs by that time. As much as we wish it were so, realistically, it's not going to happen. The government needs to be planning for that. But are they? What are they going to do for all those people? Are they planning for the fact there's going to be a massive number of people that will have to default on their mortgage payments or that will have to default on their rent?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where do they intend all these people to live, for a start? We are going to be escalating homelessness, for a start. I asked, 'Okay, what advice are you going to be providing to Australians in terms of which bills they don't pay, because you cannot meet all of your bills when you are living in poverty on $40 a day. Which bills? Energy? Food?' Food is usually the first to go because it's discretionary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're going to drop people back into poverty on $40 a day. What impact is that going to have on our economy and our recovery? It will have a very significant impact—a devastating impact—on our recovery. It will also impact on the states because the states will also be losing out on those people's income who are spending and injecting money into the state economies. It'll also be the states that are expected to supply the community services, the emergency relief, the homelessness shelters, when people start having to default on their payments. It isn't good enough. You need to keep the rate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the government's woeful response to my questions about the total lack of concern for the welfare of animals in the live export trade, and the failure to establish an independent office of animal welfare. The live export industry has been plagued by scandals for decades, and people right across Australia have had enough. They want it to stop. The scathing 2018 Moss review into regulation of the live export industry exposed that the Department of Agriculture lacks the skills, resources, technology, culture that will be effective in regulating the industry. The department cannot possibly promote the live export industry and its profitability and, at the same time, protect animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, as long as the Department of Agriculture is allowed to regulate the live export industry, animals will continue to suffer, will continue to die on these ships of misery. It should not be left up to whistleblowers and grassroots animal advocates to uncover the industry's crimes and hold exporters to account. The only way to begin to fix our broken animal protection system is to establish a truly independent authority with responsibility for animal welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since elected in 2013, the Liberal-Nationals government has done nothing to improve animal welfare. Worse, instead of holding abusive industries to account, they grant exemptions for animal cruelty. It is pathetic for this government to claim to be shocked and appalled whenever the routine abuse of animals is exposed, to cry your crocodile tears and then return to business as usual when you think the scandal has passed. By the time this ship carrying tens of thousands of sheep reaches its destination, thousands of sheep would have suffered inevitable heat stress. Do your job for once. Ban live exports and establish an independent office of animal welfare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This 2017 amendment limited the circumstances under which products can meet the definition of 'substantially transformed' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010</span>, which in turn limited access to the safe harbour provisions that apply to an Australian origin claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To address these issues, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Hon Karen Andrews MP, established a taskforce to review the industry's concerns and identify possible solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill has been informed by the taskforce's extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders including state and territory government agencies, Complementary Medicines Australia, manufacturers within the complementary healthcare sector, industry stakeholders with an interest in 'Made in Australia' claims, consumer organisations and Australian Made Campaign Limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reporting in February 2019, the taskforce highlighted the importance of origin labelling to the Australian community while also acknowledging the high level of concern from the complementary medicines sector, with the loss of Australian origin labelling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report also highlighted the great faith consumers placed in an Australian origin claim. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The research indicated that labels featuring an Australian origin claim, together with a bar chart and a statement indicating the proportion of Australian ingredients, best conveyed this information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Complementary medicines manufacturers believe the Australian brand, together with our high product safety standards and scrutiny of manufacturing practices by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, are all key to our strong reputation for a well-made, safe product. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the taskforce's report, we undertook a public consultation process in October 2019. We sought the views of the public and industry on a number of options to make Australian origin labelling more accessible for complementary medicines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And finally, we put a reform proposal to the states and territories through the Consumer Affairs Forum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory ministers representing their consumer affairs portfolios agreed with the Government's proposal to amend the Australian Consumer Law in a two-step process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why in December 2019, as a first step, we restored access to 'Australian Made' claims for complementary medicines manufactured in Australia, by enacting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Amendment (Australian-made Complementary Medicines) Regulations 2019</span>. These 2019 regulations were an interim solution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The on-going solution we are now preparing to deliver with the passage of this Bill is part of the second step the states and territories are supporting us to undertake. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following passage of the Bill, we will make new regulations to prescribe one or more processes in the Australian manufacture of complementary medicines that will meet the definition of 'substantially transformed'. We will also introduce an information standard to govern labelling on complementary medicines when an Australian origin claim is made under these reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has been very clear in tasking the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology to map the way forward and work, with a whole of government approach, to create the right conditions for Australian manufacturing to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our export capability is a vital driver for manufacturing. It is difficult to over-state the critical importance of export markets to enable real growth for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are a trading nation, always looking at how to develop and diversify our export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The complementary medicines sector is an important and growing contributor to Australia's economic prosperity through increasing exports. It has a positive reputation both in Australia and overseas, over a diverse product range. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The industry supports the employment of around 29,000 people, with exports valued at over $1 billion in 2019, up over 15 per cent on 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the first three months of this year we exported almost $225 million worth of complementary medicines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is in the national interest to grow this lucrative sector, and the Bill that I am introducing today marks another step on that journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In these current challenging times, there has been a groundswell of community support for Australian made products, which is good news for local manufacturers of complementary medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I know businesses are always concerned that when regulation is introduced, the compliance will be onerous. Regulations made under the changes we are introducing will only apply to those businesses that choose to rely on the new safe harbour provision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a business does not want to make an Australian origin claim under these reforms - that is, these changes to the Act, creation of new regulations and an information standard – then that business will not face any additional regulatory burden. It will not be required to comply with new labelling requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will provide long term certainty to the complementary medicines sector on their safe harbour, Australian origin claims, while responding to consumers' concerns on country of origin labelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill strikes the right balance between encouraging domestic sales and exports, while maintaining consumer confidence in the transparency of Australian origin claims, and in the value of the widely recognised 'Australian Made, Australian Grown' logo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill reflects the Government's commitment to support manufacturers and ensure that they continue to play a critical role in creating more local jobs and further driving Australia's future economic growth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill today, and take a first step towards getting dirty money out of politics. I would like to acknowledge the important work done on this issue by former Senator Lee Rhiannon and Senator Richard di Natale that has assisted in the development of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If passed, this bill would stop dirty industries with a track record of seeking to influence decision makers through donations – the banking, mining, defence, pharmaceutical, liquor, tobacco and gambling industries - from making political donations. The bill would also limit the amount that can be donated by individuals and other entities to $3,000 per election term, minimising the opportunity for big money to buy outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has never been a more important time for donation reform. Our democracy is in trouble. Public trust in parliament and politicians is at an all-time low, and the community feels less and less confident that their representatives represent them, rather than doing the bidding of their corporate donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And it's no wonder. One hundred million dollars is the amount of corporate donations that the Labor, Liberal and National parties have taken since 2012 from the big banks, from industries like mining, defence and big pharma, from property developers, and from alcohol, tobacco and gambling companies. These are just some of the industries that have paid the Liberal, National and Labor parties to put their private profits ahead of the needs of our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These industries are not donating tens of millions of dollars because they believe in the institution of strong democracy. They are donating because it gets results. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens have maintained the www.democracyforsale.org website for over a decade, tracking publicly disclosed political donations and putting a spotlight on influence-peddling. In 2018, the Senate Select Committee on the Political Influence of Donations laid out examples of the nexus between donations made by industry bodies and public policy outcomes or project approvals. The cosy relationships and the proximity of donations and policy outcomes that boost industry profits suggest undue influence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the corrosive influence that donations from the development sector had had on planning policy, infrastructure, and urban development, Queensland and New South Wales have both legislated to restrict political donations from property developers. The High Court has upheld these restrictions and this Bill seeks to extend those to the Federal arena. But it also recognises the influence of other key industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2012, the fossil fuel and resources industries have donated over $7.5 million to both of the major parties. They get $6 billion a year in fossil fuel subsidies. That's cheap fuel and accelerated depreciation that the rest of us don't get. That's a pretty good return on investment - about $2,000 in subsidies for every dollar they donate. Generous donations have also bought them a Liberal government that is completely paralysed by the words 'climate change' at a time when the Australian community faces a future of more extreme bushfires, crippling droughts and floods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cosy relationships and financial support have led to a situation where, despite overwhelming scientific evidence demanding action to address the climate crisis, borne out by the recent devastating bushfire season, no coal mine or coal seam gas project has ever been rejected by the Federal government – Coalition or Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gas industry donates millions of dollars to the government, so it was no great surprise when the Prime Minister appointed his gas industry mates to the National Covid Coordination Commission and did not even require them to publish their conflicts of interest. It was also no surprise when a Taskforce of that Commission called for and received government support for a "gas led recovery" and a plan focussed on projects that directly benefit the gas industry. Representatives who met with the Taskforce have confirmed that discussion was dominated by gas projects, ignoring renewable energy proposals despite strong support for a renewables-led recovery from scientists, economists and policy analysts. Again, the community loses the opportunity for a sustainable recovery because the government is beholden to its fossil fuel donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The banking and financial sector is also a regular contributor and beneficiary. The sector has donated about $60 million since 2012 to both sides of politics, and that support secured them immunity for some time despite the evidence of customers being ripped off all over the country. Both of the major parties had to be dragged to the banking royal commission, something the Greens campaigned for since 2014, following scandal after scandal and public backlash over their inaction. How much faster would the commission have happened if the Liberal, National and Labor parties weren't on the payroll of the banks? And would we have seen stronger action in response to the scathing royal commission report?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gambling industry is another significant donor to State and Federal political parties, and their influence can be seen in the deeply entrenched support for poker machines throughout Australia. ClubsNSW donated heavily to the Liberal party following Labor's commitment to Andrew Wilkie pokies reform. Submissions to the Senate Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations inquiry set out the clear efforts of ClubsNSW to support Coalition members who opposed the ALP / Wilkie, funnelling $30,000 to then opposition spokesperson on gambling, Kevin Andrews, and a further $10,000 following the Coalition's election and repeal of the poker machine regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are only the donations that we know about, none of which have been illegal. It doesn't include money paid to attend business forums or cash for access meetings, it ignores exorbitant subscription or membership fees, and it doesn't include money funnelled through representative and fundraising bodies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But regardless of the source or the amount, the obvious expectation from industry is that donations will return results. They're buying outcomes. This feeds the public perception that decisions in this place are made improperly, with self-interest and the interests of donors and mates consistently overriding the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In banning political donations from those industries that have a history of seeking to influence policy decisions, the bill implements a key recommendation of the Senate Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations. It makes it an offence for a prohibited donor to make a donation, or solicit another person to make a donation on its behalf. It is also an offence to accept a donation from a prohibited donor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another Committee recommendation that this bill seeks to implement is to limit all other political donations to $3,000 in an election term. As the High Court recognised in McCloy v NSW, uncontrolled use of wealth to influence decision-making compromises equal participation in democracy. By aggregating and capping all political donations made by any person or entity, the bill seeks to level the playing field and avoid those with more money gaining greater access to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will limit donations made for political purposes, but is not intended to limit donations made to political campaigners or other entities to support their non-campaign activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill makes it unlawful to accept a donation above the donation cap, and allows the Commonwealth to recover the excess as a debt. The bill complements reforms to strengthen the disclosure regime. However, the bill also recognises that, in the absence of real-time disclosure laws or a standardised register, there may be a time delay in aggregating donations. Where a donation is accepted in error that exceeds the cap, the recipient has the opportunity to return the excess to the donor to correct the error. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian public are demanding more transparent and representative government that acts in the public interest. This bill is an important first step towards getting big money out of politics and restoring public confidence in our democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we are committed to enhancing the democratic process, which surely is something that every parliament should regularly turn its mind to, this should be a priority. This bill does not stifle debate or prevent individuals from donating to support a political party. It bans donations from industries that have become associated with having a corrupting influence on how we work as decision makers and will return democracy to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government, through AMSA, enforces the rights of seafarers to decent working and living conditions under the maritime labour convention. That includes the right of seafarers to choose not to extend their contracts and to seek repatriation. There are significant challenges to crew changes in the COVID-19 environment resulting from border closures, the lack of aviation services and quarantine arrangements. On 9 April the national cabinet agreed that the Australian government and all states and territories would implement a consistent and immediate exemption for all non-cruise maritime crew for the safe movement of crew into Australia and across borders. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exemption allows for an international crew change with appropriate health protocols being met. Shore leave is permitted once a 14-day quarantine period on the vessel has elapsed and no crew member has demonstrated signs of illness or is suspected of having COVID-19. Some states and territories have additional requirements. The Australian government is working with states and territories regarding their individual jurisdiction requirements, with the desired outcome of more specific advice on how crew changes could occur effectively within Australia.</span>

                  </a>  The coalition government is working hard to keep unemployment as low as possible. Our job creation record is strong. Prior to COVID-19, we had created 1.5 million jobs since coming to office in 2013, and we will work to get Australians back to work as our economy opens up and the coronavirus restrictions are lifted in the coming months. The government is focused on getting Australians into jobs, and the best way to reduce unemployment is by supporting small and family businesses to hire Australian workers. We don't believe in setting specific targets for the number of people who should be out of work.</span>

                  </a>  Labor supports the intent of the motion, but we won't be supporting it today. We believe the concept of full employment is complex. It involves the interaction of many factors, including: the structure of the job market and industries; participation; casualisation; frictional unemployment, as some people choose to move between jobs; and how unemployment rates can interact with inflation. We think that choosing a hard unemployment target via a Senate motion is an arbitrary endeavour.</span>

The exploration and production of oil and gas in waters adjacent to Exmouth and the Ningaloo Reef has been undertaken safely and responsibly for decades. Indeed, the pristine environment of the area is testament to the successful and rigorous regulation of the industry and its ability to coexist with areas of high environmental value.</span>

                    </a>  We support this motion. The people of Queensland and of Australia deserve to be treated with respect and to have confidence that the government's serious and far-reaching decisions taking us through the COVID scare are based on credible and robust data. The government's huge economic response is based on the Doherty institute report. It seems that is in turn based on the flawed assumptions of Professor Ferguson, Imperial College, London, and I am deeply concerned as to the validity of the data and concerned about decisions made on that basis. Professor Ferguson's modelling predictions are known to be wildly exaggerated and fanciful. His work has had devastating impacts on national economies. Yet his assumptions are cited as the basis for the Doherty report. I refer to the model description where baseline values and more were obtained from Imperial College in London. The government should release Treasury and health department modelling and scenario work as the basis for blowing $320 billion.</span>

                    </a>  I'm very concerned that we see things like Treasury modelling, which is used to inform the Treasurer, having a claim of cabinet-in-confidence made over it. It seems the government is spraying cabinet sprinkle dust right across a whole range of decision-making, which, basically, denies the Australian public the ability to scrutinise and to participate in our democracy. It's really important that we have openness and transparency in relation to these matters. I remind the government that the Prime Minister is at liberty to waive any genuine privilege in relation to cabinet documents so that the Australian population can see the basis upon which decisions were made by the government.</span>

It give us an opportunity to highlight the Morrison government's continual failure to deliver, leaving Australians to suffer the consequences. This is happening in every corner of our nation, whether you're a tradie in the outer suburbs who's lost your job; whether you're a childcare worker who lost your job during the so-called free child care, because your childcare centre couldn't afford to stay open; whether you are a casual worker who didn't qualify for JobKeeper and is now unemployed; or whether you're a disability support pensioner who didn't get any extra payment but have an increasingly higher cost of living because of things like needing to catch taxis instead of being able to take public transport. We've heard this day after day in question time answers: the government is very happy to deliver the Prime Minister's, 'Scotty from marketing', advertising campaign messages, but they refuse to acknowledge the Prime Minister—</span>

                  </a>  Our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is very focused on his advertising but not on execution and delivery, as the answers given in question time from all of those opposite refuse to acknowledge any of their mistakes or bungles—or 'misexecutions'. We saw that just this afternoon from Senator Colbeck, where he was lauding the seniors emergency food delivery as an example of where they were making the best-laid plans in case they were needed. Well, they were needed. I've spoken to many a pensioner who was grateful for home delivery from Coles or Woolies or who lined up outside the many food banks in our nation. One of the reasons they were lining up was they couldn't buy toilet paper because, when they went down to the shopping centre, there was none there. So don't try to tell me that pensioners didn't need that extra support during that time. You just didn't get around to rolling it out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the other examples. There was a massive underspend on JobKeeper. Billions of dollars that was supposed to keep people connected to their jobs hasn't been spent—and guess what? We have a rising and record level of unemployment. My office has been inundated with calls from people who've had trouble getting through to Centrelink to get the support that they need. This is off the back of an overstretched system that was forced to deliver this government's ridiculous and unfair robodebt. When Centrelink collapsed because the system was overloaded by the number of calls and applications, the government didn't acknowledge it was their fault; they said there had been a cyberattack—again, marketing and spin, 'nothing to see here'. But the devil is always in the execution, and this government is failing at every turn. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at robodebt. Since 2017, we've seen example after example of how unfair and unjust it was, and heard claims that it was illegal, but the government didn't listen. Instead, to prove to the government that it was illegal, they had to be taken to court. Yet what we do get from those opposite? During a motion to take note of answers this week, I heard Senator Stoker justify the use of robodebt, despite the fact that the Prime Minister had just apologised for its use. I think Senator Stoker said something along these lines—and she'll correct me and pull me into line later if I'm wrong: 'The government's got the right to retrieve debts that are owed. That's our responsibility to the taxpayer.' And of course that is the case. But the government could not prove that these debts were in fact owed at all, hence the illegality of the whole program. You're not supposed to send a debt collector out after someone, which is what this government did—you sent debt collectors out to chase people for their Centrelink debt—unless you can prove that a debt is actually owed, which you couldn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the home renovation scheme promising to keep tradies in jobs—well, that's if you qualify. I don't know anyone who is planning to spend $150,000 on renovating their house and who can also meet the income limits. But, even if it does get things started, the scheme cuts out later this year. You've got to have your contract signed and start work, I think, by December. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But everything that this government is doing is going to be snapped back. It absolutely terrifies me that any good work that this government is doing with the stimulus that it's injecting into the economy might be completely undone because of its snapback agenda—snapbacks before the economy is ready. Your execution of these issues is absolutely dreadful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to really think about what you're doing. We need a properly executed plan for our nation in these times of need, and yet, day after day after day, all that is revealed is the terrible, terrible mess that you are making. It is time for this government to fess up to its mistakes instead of just relying, time and time again, on your marketing pitches—marketing pitches that have absolutely nothing to do with the truth for ordinary Australians, who are suffering the consequences.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  While there are rorts, scams, secret bugging, secret recordings, funny money, and cash deals in Aldi bags going on within the Australian Labor Party, they come in here pretending to the Australian people that somehow the Morrison government is not delivering. Here I have a document of 20 pages, with 20 achievements on each page. If you know your numbers, that's about 400 achievements that we can point to. But you would have thought that the Labor Party, having been in opposition now for some seven years, would be using an opportunity such as this to tell the Australian people about their positive forward agenda. No. All we heard was seven minutes worth of criticism, of unrelenting negativity—no alternative plan for the Australian people, no plan for jobs, no reason for the Australian Labor Party to put jobs first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the coalition know that jobs are vital: vital for people's mental health, physical health, self-esteem and social interaction—vitally important. That is why the Prime Minister and the government have said, time and time again: 'Jobs are front and centre of our policy development and our policy delivery.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what do the Labor Party do, being confronted with a huge scandal in Victoria? It looks as though it's leaked over from Victoria into the bordering New South Wales. Possibly they should have had border protection between those two states! But Labor in those two states are absolutely wrecked with scandal. What do they come in here to do? They come into this place making false assertions to try to distract attention from the dilemma that they face. So we had the spectre of the would-be Prime Minister of this country addressing CEDA, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, and I think his big-picture vision was that we might have national drivers licences—really big-picture stuff! Visionary! I'm sure that people like Bob Hawke and John Curtin would be thinking: 'If only we could have come up with such a dynamic policy formulation for the future of our nation'!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the Australian Labor Party so bereft of any policies? Because it is so consumed in internal warfare, branch stacking, funny money, Aldi bags—you name it. So, even when the Morrison government is delivering—from a space agency right through to child protection, right across the board—we have the hapless opposition betwixt and between, deciding whether or not they might actually support mandatory sentencing for those that abuse the most precious thing within our community—namely, our children. They agreed with mandatory sentencing for border protection, but not for people who abuse our children, the next generation? Where was the policy thought? Where was the policy formulation? Let alone where was the moral compass in determining that mandatory sentencing should not be part and parcel of the criminal law—especially when you are confronted with the fact that 39 per cent of those convicted of child sex offences weren't sent to jail? It's hard to imagine a more horrific crime, and yet the Labor Party are betwixt and between, not knowing how or why they should be protecting our children, because they're consumed by their internal warfare, their internal hatred, their factionalism—you name it—and so they take their eye off the ball.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to talk about the litany of policy failures, can I remind those opposite that, if you live in a glasshouse, it's very foolish to throw rocks. That of course is what the Australian Labor Party have done with bringing this forward, because, if the Labor Party want to throw rocks at policy failures, I can hear one pane of glass smashing as I mention live cattle exports, another pane of glass smashing as I mention Pink Batts, another pane of glass being smashed when I mention the cash splash to the dead, and so the list goes on. And who could forget Fuelwatch or GROCERYchoice—the list of policy failures? And then, of course, on top of it all was the legacy of deficit and debt, which is a mortgage and an imposition on the next generation of Australians—completely and utterly immoral, in circumstances where you put such a millstone around the neck of the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I suppose I'm somewhat gobsmacked at the cheek of the Australian Labor Party to come in here to assert that somehow Mr Morrison has failed to deliver, in circumstances where we have faced a pandemic—a once-in-a-century problem. I think most people recognise that Prime Minister Morrison has handled that exceptionally well, with his bringing together of the national cabinet and dealing with the border closures to protect Australia, before the World Health Organization was even willing to admit that we had a pandemic on our hands and that closing our international borders might be a good idea. Prime Minister Morrison is leading from the front, delivering for the Australian people. All you have to do is a comparison of the death rates. The last time I looked, we had, I think, four deaths per million of population whereas our cousins in the United Kingdom were confronted with 482 per million. There was 100 times the mortality and fatality rate in the UK, yet the Australian Labor Party comes in here and talks about policy failure. Excuse me! With a record like that, the world is looking to Australia, as we speak, asking how it is that we have achieved such a good result. It is through hard policy discussion and delivery and making it happen.</span>

                  </a>  We have this hapless senator from New South Wales interjecting, suggesting we were listening to Victorian Labor. That would be the last thing anybody in Australia would want to do today—listen to what's coming out of the Victorian Labor Party—unless you are interested in <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> and all the disclosures there. But I would have thought that using the Victorian Labor Party as the gleaming star example of Labor Party success is indicative of how bereft the federal Labor Party is. They actually look to the Victorian Labor Party as some sort of guiding light! How desperate would you have to be to look to Mr Andrews and his state government for that? How many ministers have now resigned—I think it was three or four—and how many others are under a cloud?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those opposite: if you want to be treated seriously by the Australian people, come forward with a positive policy agenda. It is no use just throwing rocks and hoping that the Australian people will be distracted from your own failure in relation to policy. Just look at defence. In six years not a single major project was started or thought about—let alone delivering jobs for our fellow Australians. Be it in defence, be it in welfare, be it in border protection, be it in trying to balance the budget—the list goes on and on and on of positive policy achievements for the betterment of the welfare of the people of Australia. That stands in stark contradistinction to what the Australian Labor Party has to offer—scandal, scams, bugging each other and reporting each other to the police. And, all the while, they fail to deliver a positive agenda for the Australian people. So, I am more than happy to support Mr Morrison and his government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this MPI and to raise the Morrison government's failure to adequately invest in the care economy. The government is failing to take the opportunity to make sure that, as we come out of this crisis, we focus on a better normal: addressing our health, economic, climate and inequality crises. An element where the government has been missing is underinvesting in the care economy, which must be part of our recovery. For too long, we have ignored the wellbeing and economic benefits from investing in social and community services. Investment in social infrastructure, such as community and social services, education, health, aged care and child care, has a positive impact on the whole of society. Not only does this address inequality and wellbeing; it increases productivity and generates future revenue. A focus on preventative health and social care is an investment in future wellbeing that also reduces the need for further public expenditure if we are addressing these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New research from The Open University shed light on the economic and social benefits of investing in, as they call it, the care industry. Research has found that if Australia invested one per cent of its GDP in the care industry it would result in raising the employment rate by 1.2 per cent. If we invested the same amount in the construction industry it would only increase the employment rate by 0.2 per cent. That's not to say construction isn't important. Issues such as public transport, renewable energy and social housing must be invested in, but that is not enough for our recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, investment in the care economy would help reduce the gender employment gap. The research showed that 79 per cent of new jobs created through investment in the care industry would be filled by women. There are clearly striking benefits to investing in education, health, social services and community services—benefits that you would think any government investing in and navigating its way out of this crisis and recession would be interested in capitalising on. It just shows how critical the care economy is to our recovery. This research is very important and I urge the government to take it on board. The social fabric of our nation is important. In the midst of a recession, we need a new way of doing things. I urge the government to recognise the value of the care economy and start investing to deliver access to essential services for all Australians.</span>

I don't think there would be any other country in the Western world where the Minister for Aged Care would simultaneously be the Minister for Youth, but that's what the Morrison government has delivered to the people of Australia. Senator Colbeck's answers in question time are an enduring delight for everybody, I'm sure. He was asked about the performance of the government in relation to a promise that the government made to deliver 36,000 food packages to elderly Australians. Like many of the announcements that the Morrison government makes, they're breathlessly made with press releases, videos, government ministers standing in front of microphones but very little delivery. In this case 36,000 were promised but 38 were delivered. Even my high-school maths tells me that that's not 10 per cent, not one per cent but 0.01 per cent delivery. It's an emblem of the government's failure. It's an emblem of the cancer that goes to the heart of this government's approach to policy delivery and delivering for all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in the other place, the Prime Minister was asked about the impact on women from Yass who have to travel to either Canberra or Goulburn to give birth. His answer was that there might need to be some improvements to the road system. He is out of touch, out of his depth, entirely devoted to spin. He has no capacity for the policy substance. And there are so many examples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party doesn't have a Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture in this place. On the commitments the government has made to Australian agriculture and the Australian farming industry: biosecurity levy? No delivery. A real-time payment platform for dairy farmers, breathlessly announced in the election campaign? The minister crawled back from that proposition today—another policy failure, another failure to deliver on behalf of this government. That would have meant something for Australian dairy farmers. The government promise to deal with $1 milk and the floor price for dairy farmers? No delivery. Drought response? No delivery. Not all the money has gone out the door—the government appears incompetent at delivering money to Australian farmers. They can fill the advertising budgets of the agencies and send people driving all over the country, but there's no real delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the coronavirus response, which I listened to Senator Abetz talk about. The absolute disaster of policy failure on coronavirus in the United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom and the failure of government responses in those places, driven by the kind of politics that animates some people on the government's backbench, is a cautionary tale. In contrast the Australian public health response so far has delivered a very good outcome, but the Prime Minister took a very long time to get to there; it was only the response of the state premiers that dragged him to reaching the right policy conclusions. Meanwhile, in New South Wales, the failure of Border Force, the Border Force minister and the Prime Minister to stop the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> debacle has delivered misery to the four corners of the Australian continent—misery in every state, infections in every state and many, many deaths as a result of that policy failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the coalition's economic response. There's no certainty about what's going to happen when there's a snapback of the jobseeker payment. Prior to the announcement of the scheme, it was universally acknowledged by everybody except those on the other side that Centrelink payments were too low for unemployed Australians. The snapback will have dire consequences. JobKeeper, a policy demanded by Labor, was mocked by people in here up until a few days before the government announced it. But there are serious policy failures there too: millions of Australian casuals excluded, universities excluded and international students left to starve. Australia's reputation oversees has been shattered, with international students who can't pay their bills and can't get enough to eat queuing for food in all of our major cities. And the entertainment and arts sector has been left to fail by a government that doesn't understand its responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the enormous $60 billion error in the forecasting and delivery of that policy. As the Leader of the Opposition said, you could see it from space. The Americans managed to put a man on the moon for less than $60 billion, in today's dollar terms. It is the biggest forecasting and delivery error in Australian history. I imagine it's probably the biggest error in the Southern Hemisphere. The one thing that the Minister for Finance can be confident of, the one achievement he can notch up there, is that nobody else will make an error that big. He is in the record books for the biggest policy error in Australian political history. That is the end of the Morrison government's economic credibility. They needn't knock at the door of economic credibility ever again. It's overconfidence and smugness that lead to policy neglect, and that error has real consequences. Rating agencies made decisions about the position they took in relation to the Australian economy. People made investment decisions. Many more people are unemployed because of that policy failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HomeBuilder scheme—you couldn't design such a scheme even if you got the cleverest people in the country and said to them: 'I want you to design a scheme that reaches almost nobody, and, for those that it does reach, I want it to fund them a little bit extra to do a project that they were already going to do.' They devised a policy scheme that would provide no extra stimulus to the Australian economy—none—but drive up inequality, which is emblematic of this government's approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pre-COVID, the government had nothing to boast about. There was downward pressure on wages—flatlining wages; downward pressure on retail spending; declining business investment; and decreased productivity. Monetary policy was on its knees, with the Reserve Bank begging the government to actually do something. Fiscal policy was in all sorts of trouble, and there was no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On all sorts of other policy areas, like the federal ICAC the government promised they would deliver—no delivery. On energy policy, Senator Canavan's favourite thing, there are plenty of policies—there have been 17 of them—but none have been delivered. They've managed to construct an environment in energy policy where prices go up, emissions go up, investment goes down and confidence is shattered. The manufacturing industry has been forced offshore because of their policy failure and incapacity to develop a plan. Senator Canavan's mad plan for a new, expensive coal-fired power station would only serve to add to the policy chaos in energy policy on the other side of the chamber and push prices up further. It would increase emissions further and drive more industry offshore. He is smart enough to know it but he will continue to press that case because it suits him. There are 140,000 fewer apprentices. There is robodebt. Finally, in terms of delivery, we have the government's position in relation to Australia Post. Well, policy delivery there will mean that, because of Scott Morrison's plan for Australia Post, people in regional areas will get their mail later.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with these people is that they believe their own spin. They believe their own spin and they are condemned to repeat it. On the grave and serious issues that face Australia in terms of its future economy—Australia's place in a more dangerous world; dealing with climate change; making sure that we reconcile effectively with our First Australians; and the future of our rivers and our country towns—they are not up to the task of charting a course for modern Australia in very challenging times.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I thought this MPI was going to focus on the failure to deliver for Australians during coronavirus. That's what Senator Ayres was focused on for most of his contribution, but you could tell he ran out of steam because he didn't have much more to say by the end and started talking about energy policy and all these other things that we have disagreements on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a shame that the Australian Labor Party can't bring themselves to share a bit of the pride that I think most Australians feel in how the country has responded over the past few months. It's been a challenging time for our nation. It's been more challenging for some than others. One thing I think we as a nation can take heart from is that, overall, we have responded in a united, committed, determined way to tackle this virus and to support each other through it. That cooperation, that determination, has been led by the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. He's led that commitment and he's been supported by other governments around the country. I'm happy to say he's been supported by governments of the other side of politics, of the Labor Party, and by Liberal-National governments across the country, who have come together to cooperate in support to do the right thing by our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm most proud of, though, is how the Australian people have come together to fight this virus and have overall complied with the onerous restrictions placed on their livelihoods. In good humour, and with steely determination, they have sought to respond and adjust to the changing economic circumstances facing them. I'm astounded by the resilience of so many small-business people in this country who have had their livelihoods turned upside down but have dusted themselves off, gone on with what they could do and made the best of what has been a pretty hard road for some. That's what I'm proud of. It's a shame that the opposition can't bring themselves to express even one iota of that pride in that shared achievement of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By any measure, this nation has responded as well as, if not better than, almost any country in the world to this threat. We have stayed largely united. We have complied with the restrictions and we have done what we needed to do to protect the safety of others, and we are supporting each other in the fallout from what we've had to do and also in the rebuilding effort that is to come. That is something I think we should take pride in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to say that every decision governments around the country have made has been precisely perfect. But, overall, we have made sure that we have responded in a way that has protected Australians' health, that we have supported those who have needed assistance and that we are now also focused on rebuilding and creating jobs as we recover from what's happened in the last few months. I think our Liberal-National government has been particularly responsive and has made sure that it's parked any ideological commitments, or ones we may have previously made, and done what is right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem here is that the Australian Labor Party haven't quite caught up with the program. They still think that somehow the caricature they present of the Liberal National government is true, that somehow we're evil mean-spirited people who only want to deliver budget surpluses because we like to be evil and mean spirited. No. We deliver those surpluses because they're important, to protect the future generations of Australia. But when other priorities come along—as they have, here, in the last few months—we adjust, because the end objective is to deliver for Australians. And that is what we have done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must, though, at some stage, return to the important point that we cannot keep spending forever. We have to be mindful of the debt that has been racked up, because all of the spending, all of the assistance we've provided in the last few months, has been borrowed money. We've had to borrow a lot of it from overseas, to support Australians. It's the right thing to do right now, but it has to be repaid. It is not our money, down here. It is the Australian people's debt that will be repaid, from themselves and their children and grandchildren, and we will commit ourselves to the prudent application of funds to support Australians, to get us through this crisis and rebuild our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I support this submission. In recent letters to the Prime Minister—in March, April and May—we expressed concern over the government's use of flawed modelling data to justify locking us all away and causing untold damage to our economy, businesses and jobs. The government's responses to these letters did not address the real issues, yet they stated: 'The government is well aware of the heavy economic and social toll created by the restrictions.' Today, now, we need to know where the plan is to rebuild our businesses and jobs—or will the Prime Minister just cut the COVID lifeline and feed our workers and businesses to the sharks? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already hearing about insolvency practices preparing to wind up many struggling Australian businesses, and as many as one in six could disappear soon. Back in the global financial crisis, the Labor government applied academic models that left us with high budget deficits and public debt. Yet they did not address the real problems, and soon we may have a national debt of well over $1 trillion—and nothing to show for it. What due diligence was done on flawed infection modelling from Professor Ferguson in Britain? That locked us all up. If this government had learnt early from nations like Taiwan and promptly adopted rigorous testing, combined with strict isolation for people with the virus and isolation of the vulnerable, the rest would have been returned to work far sooner, with minimal economic disruption. Taiwan, for example, isolated the sick and vulnerable. The healthy continued working. They have a strong economy. Their health is 15 times better than Australia's. The Prime Minister will really be tested in October, when the support stops and we see businesses and our economy unravel.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  At the start of this pandemic, as many Australians across the country watched daily press conferences, each time the number went up about the restrictions that will be put in place I know that many Australians' stomachs just sank—particularly our arts and entertainment workers, who knew that, with every new restriction announced and increased, their jobs would be some of the first to go and some of the last to come back. I know this because when those announcements were being made I was sitting next to an arts worker: my wife. As the ghost lights were switched on in theatres across the country, this government ghosted arts workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Far North Queensland, we have a vibrant arts community and this is backed up by a strong line-up of Indigenous performers from the Cape and the Torres Strait Islands and other regions across outback Queensland. Every year several arts and dance festivals are held, including the Cairns international arts festival, which has had to go online this year. It is incredibly disappointing, I know, for many of those performers and workers that the income that they get from the events that were due to be held won't be coming in this year. But it is even more devastating that those workers were not included in the government's plans to support people through JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There might be some people in here that think that regional Queenslanders don't care about the arts, but I know that that's not true, because they talk to me everywhere I go in regional Queensland about the arts industry. I know this because I was in regional Queensland, in Stanthorpe, when the government axed the arts department. I was in Stanthorpe because they were facing a water crisis. I was pleased to find out, apart from the fact that they were talking about water security, that one of the things that they were very concerned about was this government's record on the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arts and entertainment workers are among millions excluded from the government's JobKeeper program. The structure of JobKeeper was designed in a way to exclude performers employed in the arts and entertainment sector, and it is having real-life consequences. These workers, who often make ends meet from gig to gig, have been forced to deal with the complete shutdown of their industry on their own. We know that, in many parts of regional Queensland and other regional areas across the country, arts and entertainment workers are actually employed by local councils, and local councils' workers were also excluded from JobKeeper. But, in another cruel blow, many arts and entertainment workers fund the jobs that they love so much by picking up casual hospitality jobs from time to time. Those jobs were also excluded from JobKeeper, unless they had worked for their employer for more than 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These heartless exclusions really cut deep, and that's because it hurts when you feel like you're not worth government support even though you do a valuable job. Arts and entertainment workers do the jobs that they do because they love their work. Their creativity is tied up in their identity, and I know that it would be absolutely devastating for them to not be able to do that work right now. They understand the reasons why and the restrictions that are in place and they want to get back to work as soon as those restrictions are lifted. But, throughout this period, they've been doing that on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government won't even acknowledge that there is a problem, even though they have been whispering now for a little while about a specific rescue package for the arts sector. If the government is going to raise expectations for these workers, it is better to deliver genuine support for workers. There is an official parliamentary petition calling on the Morrison government to support arts and entertainment workers through the coronavirus crisis, and it has passed more than 30,000 signatures this week. This incredible support makes this one of the most successful parliamentary petitions in recent years, with three weeks yet to run. The response is yet more evidence that this is an industry in crisis, crying out for help from this government, and it is an industry supported by our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have called for a comprehensive industry support package, including support for workers themselves, many of whom have been shut out of the government's JobKeeper wage subsidy. At the start of June, the government gave those workers a glimmer of hope, as I said, by suggesting that there would be a rescue package on the way, but now, two weeks later, there's still nothing, and these workers are desperately waiting for that assistance. Why did the government raise expectations just to let these people down once again? The Palaszczuk Labor government has delivered $42.5 million for the arts industry, and that includes $22.5 million announced yesterday. That funding will focus on stabilising local art companies and see that jobs for artists and arts workers are protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that arts workers are resilient. The show must and will go on. As I said at the beginning of my speech, many ghost lights were lit in theatres all across the country during this time. I thought I'd share some words from Ange Sullivan, who is Head of Lighting at the Sydney Opera House. She said that ghost lights have two main functions. There's a practical reason, to make sure that, if anyone goes into the theatre, they can see where they're going and they don't fall off the front of the stage, but there's another romantic idea about ghost lights, that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

Every arts worker in this country will remember the amount of times that they asked for help and they were not listened to. Arts workers are really, really struggling, not only because they have lost their jobs, but because they can't do what they love to do right now. So I'm calling on the Morrison government to deliver that rescue package and to help these arts workers in the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273828" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I know it has been a rough week for Labor members, especially ones from Victoria. But I'm not sure Senator Ciccone had finished drafting the MPI before submitting, given both its lack of specificity and its blatant deception. The Morrison government is proud of what it has delivered and continues to deliver for our nation. Throughout this unprecedented time, our focus is on fighting the virus, delivering the economic lifeline Australians need to get through the course of the virus, reopening our economy and our society with a clear road ahead, building confidence and momentum in our economy and growing our economy for the years ahead. This is a five-year plan that will shape our country for the next 30 years. That means we're getting Australians out from under the doona, delivering jobs, guaranteeing the essential services Australians rely on, getting children back into school, keeping Australians safe and taking care of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the JobMaker plan to get Australia moving, focused on infrastructure and deregulation. This includes almost $72 billion in major infrastructure projects across the country being fast-tracked, slashing approval times and creating 66,000 jobs. And because the government recognises that, in these unprecedented times, some Australians will need to depend on government assistance in the short term, it has already temporarily supercharged the social security safety net, providing additional assistance to Australians affected by the economic impacts of the pandemic. Payments are rolling out for the $70 billion JobKeeper program, including a $1,500 per fortnight wage subsidy for 3½ million Australians. We have a $150 million domestic violence support package, to help family and domestic violence support services meet the growing demand as a result of the impacts of the coronavirus crisis. We're supporting senior Australians through two new initiatives under a $6 million communications package to prevent loneliness and social isolation. The government has also awarded $1 million in grants to 215 local community organisations to provide at-risk seniors with digital devices, such as mobile phones and laptops. The Morrison government is continuing to take action to help Australians whose mental health and wellbeing is affected by the pandemic by providing an additional $48 million to support the Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan. The list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were delivering prior to COVID and we will continue to deliver in the face of this crisis and beyond. We were already seeing increases in job creation and increases in female participation in the workforce and we are looking to the future, ready to build on that. The Morrison government is delivering. We're focused on taking care of people now and setting up our nation for success in the coming decades. We all know the impacts of the coronavirus across the economy and that they have been severe. Businesses and households are facing increased uncertainty, and economic activity has slowed significantly, but this government's economic support package has provided timely support to affected workers, businesses and the broader community and it has kept Australians in work and businesses in business. We have put a floor under the economy and will lay the foundation for a strong economic recovery. The government is focusing on reopening and rebuilding. We need to get businesses back open. We need to enable Australians to go back to work. We need to ensure that consumers and businesses have the confidence to return to normal activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to Senator Ciccone and the point that he may have been trying to make: there are some things we are very proud to have failed to deliver, and quite frankly the Australian electorate are pretty relieved that we have. We failed to deliver a retiree tax. We failed to deliver limitations to negative gearing that would have seen increases in rental prices and decimated the property investment market. We failed to deliver a pink batts program that literally lead to tragic deaths. We failed to deliver unwanted and overpriced school halls. We failed to deliver cheques to dead people. We failed to deliver cash in ALDI bags. We failed to deliver cash in folders along with fake ALP membership forms. We failed to deliver a protection racket for paedophiles rather than protect Australian children. And we definitely failed to sell out Australia to the highest bidder. Unlike those opposite, we are not failing the Australian people. We are delivering the economic health and security they need now and into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  The Morrison government has failed to deliver; it sure has. It has failed to deliver a society where First Nations people are safe and equal, a society free of racism and discrimination. The Morrison government has failed to deliver justice to our First Australians. That's why tens of thousands of people have been protesting in the streets. Yet what does the Prime Minister focus on when asked about police brutality and black deaths in custody? He praises statues of colonisers, he denies slavery and he condemns protesters. He is definitely silent on the racist policies and institutions that are costing lives and tearing families apart. If only he cared as much about black lives as he does about protecting statues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Black lives are at risk every day in Australia, and all the media and public attention on police violence hasn't stopped police officers attacking innocent people. On Monday, the South Australian police assaulted and wrongfully arrested Noel Henry. This violence isn't unusual, but this time it was filmed. South Australian police have now started an internal investigation. Police officers investigating other police officers—we know how that will end. Just today we have learnt that a senior counterterrorism police officer in New South Wales delivered a gross and mocking acknowledgement of country at a police Christmas party last year. This speech was reworded to acknowledge 'the Tactical Operations Unit nation' instead of traditional owners. It was stomach churning and disgusting and shows the unbridled disrespect and contempt that police have for First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people in Australia are the most incarcerated group per capita anywhere in the world. We have seen 437 black deaths in custody and not one conviction. Every day, new stories emerge of how differently Indigenous people in this country are treated from everyone else, and this is all happening on their land, on stolen land. It is this original and ongoing sin that has taken root in our unequal power structures, in our racist institutions and in our laws, yet the Morrison government is nowhere. We must stop police brutality and systemic racism against First Nations people and other people of colour. We must make up for our original sin, dismantle systems of oppression and finally see justice for First Nations people. All of us must examine our own settler colonial history, listen to and centre black voices and actively work to decolonise.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, and I'd like to start by thanking my very good friend, fellow Collingwood supporter and senator for Victoria, Senator Ciccone, for this dorothy dixer. It is wonderful to have the opportunity to highlight the role the Morrison government has had in delivering jobs, guaranteeing essential services, keeping Australians safe and taking care of our country. Let's be frank: for those opposite, the past week must've felt like the red wedding episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span>. I believe Senator Ciccone is probably the only Victorian parliamentarian not checking for reds under the bed at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Victorians, the past year has been a year like no other. From the drought to the bushfires and now the COVID pandemic, the Morrison government has been there every step of the way. It is coming up to a year since I took my seat in this place, so let's go to the highlight reel and discuss what the Morrison government has actually delivered. In my first week in this place, we delivered $158 billion in tax cuts—not a bad start to the year. In response to the drought, the Australian government committed over a billion dollars across the country to support the drought response recovery and preparedness actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the bushfires came along. Earlier this week I spoke about the significant support that the Morrison government had given to bushfire victims. I was also lucky enough to spend some time with BlazeAid down in Gippsland, where I saw firsthand the damage that the fires had done. It was clear to me that the effort needed to recover from this is going to be enormous and long lasting. To that end, the Morrison government delivered on that as well. Through the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, we've committed $2 billion to the Regional Bushfire Recovery and Development Program. Of that, $1.3 billion has been spent so far. That has looked after 281,000 Australians, who have received direct financial support through disaster recovery allowance payments. Additionally, 23,000 businesses have received direct financial assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, while we were working on the bushfire recovery, the coronavirus pandemic hit. The Morrison government initiated one of the most successful responses in the world, saving tens of thousands of lives and millions of livelihoods. The Commonwealth, in supporting people during the coronavirus pandemic, has already committed $260 billion towards mitigating the economic impacts of the coronavirus. In that, there is $70 billion worth of payments rolling out for the JobKeeper program, including the $1,500-per-fortnight wage subsidy keeping 3.5 million Australians in their jobs. For those who lost their job or didn't have one, we've established a new time-limited coronavirus supplement to be paid at the rate of $550 per fortnight on top of the existing $550 per fortnight. To say that there has been a failure in letting people fall through the cracks is just not true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been payments of up to $100,000 to eligible small and medium-sized businesses and not-for-profits. Additionally, $200 million will go to more than 300 charities to support the community. For mental health, $48 million to support the pandemic response plan was presented to national cabinet last week. In order to get the country moving out of the pandemic crisis, we have committed a further $1.5 billion to immediately start work on small priority projects defined by the states and territories. Of that, $1 billion is going to projects that are now shovel-ready and $500 million is reserved specifically to target road safety works. I should remind the Senate that this builds on around $7.8 billion worth of projects we brought forward since last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just like to show that the combined contribution of the states and territories totals only $36 billion. So the federal government, the Morrison government, has delivered eight times what the states have done. In my home state of Victoria, they've only delivered a paltry $5.2 billion in initiatives. So, colleagues, I think it's safe to say the Morrison government has not failed in any way, shape or form but has delivered incredibly well for the country.</span>

I'll tell you who it hasn't failed to deliver for: vested interests and its big business donors. They're doing quite nicely, thank you very much, out of this government, and, likewise, the government's political party is doing quite nicely out of the donations that come from that large sector. There have been millions of dollars in donations made to the Liberal-National Party since they have been in government—from the big mining companies, from the gambling industry, from property developers, from all sorts of people that want favours and want policy written that favours their bottom line. And, hey presto, we get tax cuts for those large companies and tax cuts for the wealthy. So it sounds like they're delivering quite nicely for their donor mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that fossil fuel companies give tens of millions of dollars in donations, and this government continues to deliver fossil fuel subsidies, accelerated depreciation that nobody else gets, discounted diesel fuel that nobody else gets. Now they're getting a fast-tracking of environmental laws. And you know what else they're getting? They're getting a commission stacked with representatives from the gas industry that don't have to disclose their conflicts of interest to the public or, in some cases, don't have to disclose them at all, and a commission that's recommending, who would have guessed it, yet more investment in gas infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering quite nicely for the big polluters, who happen to be big donors to its political party, and it is absolutely negligent in dealing with the climate crisis. The government could be investing in job-rich renewable energy. It could be funding schools and hospitals. But instead it's dishing out tax cuts to the wealthy and to big business and it's paving the way for yet more dirty gas to wreck our land, to wreck our water and to wreck our climate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to speak to the ANAO report on the Regional Investment Corporation. The Regional Investment Corporation, or RIC, was established in 2018, with significant financing, supposedly to streamline administration of $4 billion in concessional loans across two schemes, for farm businesses and national water infrastructure. As we can see in this report from the ANAO, $387 million, across 367 farm loans, has been approved within 18 months of operation. The ANAO note that the RIC board appointments largely reflect the required skill sets and find that there were, on average, 113 business days between submission and decision on loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the board, the ANAO report shows that, between June 2018 and March 2020, there had been no skills coverage on the board in relation to financial accounting and auditing. This is a pretty massive oversight for an investment corporation making large loans. More concerningly, the ANAO report notes that the then chair declared a conflict of interest on 10 September 2019 but continued to chair the meeting, including in relation to the RIC strategic framework and audit and budget updates. The chair's resignation to the minister didn't follow until 19 September 2019, despite requirements under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act for notification as soon as possible and taking steps to manage conflicts of interest. This is pretty extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the timing for the loans, this is something that I'm quite concerned about. In particular, I want to highlight the case of loans to plantations which were intended to be delivered by the RIC. As part of their election commitments, the Liberals committed to support the delivery of one billion new plantation trees through a new concessional loan product under the Regional Investment Corporation. There was a very short consultation that took place on that approach between November and December 2019. But, despite the promises, the process, the spin and the marketing, we've yet to see the Liberals deliver on this. In fact, media reporting today confirms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CHEAP loans aimed at boosting the nation's forestry plantations have yet to be rolled out, more than a year after they were first promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to end native forest logging, with its terrible impacts on our wildlife, water and climate. Instead we should be supporting environmentally sustainable forestry plantations, including through these concessional loans where appropriate, to help complete the shift to a wood products industry that is 100 per cent based on plantations, shifting from the current 88 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Liberals are all marketing spin and no substance when it comes to doing the right thing. We've known for decades the incredible damage that native forest logging does. We know it's bad for the ecosystems that are torn apart and it's bad for threatened species whose habitats are destroyed. It's terrible for our communities too, and we lose the benefits of the forest as a carbon store, which are so critical as we face a climate emergency. Then we lose the economic benefits that come from regional tourism as people travel to explore these precious places. But, most of all, we lose the forests themselves, that incredibly important connection to nature and the incredible beauty and diversity of these forests as they are logged, taking hundreds of years, if ever, to return to something similar to their former state. So much is at stake, and there are enormous implications. That's why the recent Federal Court decision on logging native forests in Victoria was so important. It found that native forest logging in 66 forest areas across Australia was illegal, and it put native forest logging on notice. It's got implications right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's time for the Commonwealth to get out of native forest logging. It was time decades ago. So we need action from the government on support for sustainable plantations and jobs in the plantation based wood products industries. But, sadly, the Regional Investment Corporation hasn't even been able to issue any of these loans. Instead we have this ANAO report showing that the RIC has taken more than 100 business days on average to approve loans under its existing schemes. If you're seeking financing under a concessional loan scheme for plantations, you are still waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All we've seen from this government is slick spin and marketing. We saw it in forestry videos commissioned by the department to make the forestry industry look incredibly glossy. For a party that likes to talk about government waste, the Liberals spend far too much on marketing and spin. They should deliver the substance that makes a real difference by supporting plantations and ending native forest logging.</span>

                    </a>  I rise to speak to the tabling of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation's annual report 2019. For almost 90 years, the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation Committee has operated on a genuinely non-partisan basis to scrutinise all delegated legislation subject to disallowance by the Senate against the technical scrutiny principles set out in standing order 23. In doing so, the committee plays an essential role in ensuring on behalf of the Senate that executive made laws comply with the fundamental principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019 annual report documents one of the most significant years in the committee's history. As part of its regular scrutiny work in 2019, the committee examined 1,434 disallowable legislative instruments in 13 private meetings. Approximately 16 per cent of the instruments considered by the committee raised technical scrutiny concerns. Consistent with previous years, the majority of the committee's scrutiny concerns related to compliance with statutory requirements. However, there was a marked increase in the proportion of instruments which, in the committee's view, contained matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to its regular scrutiny work, the annual report highlights several important changes to the committee's principles and practices during 2019 which have greatly enhanced the committee's capacity to perform its scrutiny role. Perhaps most significantly, the committee reported on its 2019 inquiry into the continuing effectiveness, role and future direction of the committee and the adequacy of the existing framework of parliamentary control and scrutiny of delegated legislation. The committee made 22 unanimous recommendations which emphasised the need to strengthen the committee's powers, functions and scrutiny principles and the broader framework of parliamentary control and delegated legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since tabling its inquiry report, the committee has taken a number of steps to promote these objectives. For example, in November 2019 the Senate agreed to the committee's proposed amendments to Senate standing orders 23 and 25(2)(a). Amongst other things, the amendments to the standing orders changed the committee's name to more accurately reflect the scope of the committee's work, amended the scope of instruments that the committee could consider, provided the committee with permanent general inquiry powers, enabled the committee to self-initiate inquiries into matters exclusively related to the technical scrutiny of delegated legislation, clarified the scope of the committee's scrutiny principles, enabled the committee to identify but not assess issues in delegated legislation likely to be of interest to the Senate, and clarified the power of the legislation committees to inquire into and report on delegated legislation made in the portfolios allocated to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the changes to the committee's standing orders, the annual report details a number of changes that the committee made to its internal work practices in 2019. For the first time in 19 years, the committee conducted private briefings with senior departmental officers to gather further information to resolve its scrutiny concerns without recourse to disallowance. The committee is grateful to the representatives of the Department of Home Affairs and the eSafety Commissioner for their participation in such briefings in 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also held its first ever private briefing with a minister as part of its scrutiny of the Quality of Care Amendment (Minimising the Use of Restraints) Principles 2019. The committee thanks the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians for his constructive engagement with the committee to satisfactorily resolve its scrutiny concerns about that instrument. These briefings embody the deliberative model of parliamentary scrutiny on which the committee's work is based and have proved to be a particularly effective means of resolving its technical scrutiny concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From July 2019, the committee also changed its reporting practices to draw the Senate's attention to its most significant scrutiny concerns—to outstanding undertakings and instruments which authorise Commonwealth expenditure. For example, throughout the year, the committee reported on delegated legislation which authorised expenditure amounting to over $6 billion. I'm pleased to report that, since implementing these changes for its reporting practices, the committee has observed an increased responsiveness and timeliness by ministers and agencies in engaging with the committee to resolve technical scrutiny concerns. For example, the rate with which undertakings were implemented has increased tenfold since the committee altered its reporting practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While 2019 saw some significant steps towards strengthening parliamentary oversight of delegated legislation, some significant challenges remain. The annual report notes some key technical scrutiny issues which the committee will continue to monitor in the future. In particular, I would like to emphasise the committee's concerns regarding the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight. In 2019, approximately 20 per cent of delegated legislation was exempt from disallowance and, therefore, removed from oversight by this committee and the parliament more generally. This proportion is likely to increase in 2020, due to the significant number of exempt instruments being made in response to COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its response to the committee's inquiry, the government committed to publishing guidance and materials on the circumstances where it is appropriate to exempt instruments from disallowance, and to amending the Federal Register of Legislation to enable exempt instruments to be easily identified. However, the committee notes that the government has yet to fulfil these commitments. These concerns have informed the committee's decision to undertake an inquiry into the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight, using its new own-motion inquiry power. The committee looks forward to working constructively with the executive branch of government to address the issues arising from this inquiry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work and assistance of the committee's legal adviser, Associate Professor Andrew Edgar. Committee members and committee staff very much value his expertise and his excellent counsel. I would like to especially acknowledge the hard work and commitment of the secretariat staff: Glenn Ryall, the committee secretary; Laura Sweeney, the principal research officer; and all the team. Without all your efforts, we would not have been able to achieve so much during one of the most significant years of the operation of the committee. I also thank ministers and departments for their willingness to constructively engage with the committee to resolve scrutiny issues. </span>

With these comments, I commend the committee's annual report 2019 to the Senate. I move:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I present Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 8 of 2020 of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two key matters raised in the monitor. The first concerns the committee's scrutiny of the National Health (Take Home Naloxone Pilot) Special Arrangement 2019. This instrument makes a special arrangement under section 100 of the National Health Act to support the establishment of a PBS subsidised pilot program to supply naloxone to people who are at risk of an opioid overdose and persons who are likely to be able to assist such persons. In doing so, section 25 of the instrument provides that private third parties may be authorised by contract or other means to exercise all of the departmental secretary's powers and perform all of the departmental secretary's functions under the instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that the authorisation of private third parties to perform the powers and functions of a departmental secretary is a significant matter that must be expressly authorised on the face of an instrument's enabling act. In this case, the committee is concerned that the enabling provision of the National Health Act does not provide for such an express authorisation. The committee is also keen to ensure that appropriate accountability safeguards apply to any actions taken by private third parties in performing the functions and exercising the powers of public officials. For example, it would expect that authorised private third parties are subject to the same privacy and freedom-of-information laws as public officials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following extensive engagement with the Minister for Health, the committee retains significant scrutiny concerns about the instrument. Consequently, the committee has summarised these concerns in chapter 1 of Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 8 and is seeking further advice from the minister in the hope that this matter can be resolved without recourse to disallowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue I would like to highlight is ASIC's recent undertaking to amend three legislative instruments to address the committee's scrutiny concerns. The instruments exempt or modify the operation of specific provisions of the Corporations Act to introduce relief measures related to financial advice and capital raised during the COVID-19 pandemic. The explanatory statement indicated that the emergency measures were intended to be temporary. However, the instruments themselves did not specify end dates for the measures. As a technical scrutiny matter, the committee was concerned that allowing the exemptions to remain in force for an unspecified period undermined parliament's ability to exercise oversight of the measures and was contrary to the committee's request to ministers and agencies that COVID-19 measures be time limited. I am pleased to advise that, in response to the committee's comments, these instruments have now been amended to specify end dates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the assistant minister and ASIC for their constructive engagement with the committee on this matter. This provides an excellent example of how the executive and the committee can work together to ensure that policy objectives are implemented in a way that complies with the fundamental principles of legislative scrutiny and parliamentary oversight. With these comments, I commend the committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 8 of 2020 to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  It's my great pleasure to present <span style="font-style:italic;">Human rights scrutiny report: Report 7 of 2020 </span>of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to table the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' seventh scrutiny report of 2020. This report contains a technical examination of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. The report continues the committee's important work of scrutinising legislation developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I note in particular the legislative instruments that determine requirements to prevent or control the entry or spread of COVID-19 in designated remote communities. The committee considers that these measures promote and protect the rights to life and health. While they may necessarily limit the rights to freedom of movement, equality and non-discrimination, the committee considers these are permissible limitations. In forming this view, the committee was mindful of the potential loss of life that our nation was facing when the pandemic was first declared and the critical importance of responding immediately and urgently to mitigate and manage these risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also notes the importance of consultation with those in remote communities. I would like to quote the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon. Ken Wyatt, who advised the parliament on 14 May 2020 in relation to these measures:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So, right from the beginning, we worked with elders, leaders and peak organisations. Working with my colleague Greg Hunt, we used the Biosecurity Act to define secure areas for remote communities in order to isolate them from people bringing COVID-19 in. One of the best expressions I heard was from an elder who said, 'This thing has no songline, and we don't want to create a songline that brings death.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This demonstrates the very real human rights need for such action to be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to briefly note the committee's concluding remarks with respect to two Civil Aviation Safety Authority instruments. The committee thanks the minister for explaining the human rights compatibility of these measures and commends CASA for revising the statements of compatibility to reflect this and for adopting the same course of action for two additional relevant instruments that it has identified. This is an excellent example of the way that the committee's dialogue model of engagement with ministers and departments can work in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also continued to consider non-COVID-related legislation. In this report, the committee seeks further information in order for it to assess the human rights compatibility of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill 2020 and the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020. I think it's important to reiterate that the committee has not reached a concluded view as to these bills' compliance with human rights law. I wish to also further reiterate that the committee's statutory role is to assess proposed legislation for compatibility with the seven core international human rights treaties to which Australia is a party and then to report to the parliament. In performing this function, the committee receives legal advice from, and is assisted by, an external legal adviser as well as the secretariat staff. Our report clearly sets out the legal advice received, which is separate from any view of committee members, and I spoke about that in my last contribution. Where the committee seeks a further response from the relevant minister, the committee is seeking information as to whether particular limitations on rights which have been identified are permissible as a matter of international human rights law. I stress that most rights can be properly limited if it is demonstrated that the limitation is reasonable, necessary and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has concluded its consideration of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (International Production Orders) Bill 2020. This bill seeks to establish a new framework for international production orders to provide Australian agencies with access to overseas communications data for law enforcement and national security purposes and to allow for reciprocal arrangements for certain countries. While the committee considers that the bill seeks to achieve the important and legitimate objective of protecting national security and public safety, it has some concerns as to whether it includes sufficient safeguards. In particular, the committee has expressed its concerns that the bill, as currently drafted, does not specifically prohibit mutual assistance with a foreign country where it may lead to the imposition of the death penalty or to degrading treatment. The committee has made a number of recommendations that consideration be given to amending the bill in order to reduce the risk that information which could expose a person to the death penalty or to degrading treatment or punishment may be shared with a foreign country and to improve the compatibility of the bill with the right to privacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all parliamentarians to carefully consider the committee's analysis. With these comments, I commend the committee's report No. 7 of 2020 to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the order for the production of documents, particularly in relation general business notice of motion No. 595. I want to speak on the display of utter arrogance by the Prime Minister, who has defied an order of the Senate to produce documents in accordance with that order, and that was regarding advice received on the decision to deny a Victoria Cross to Ordinary Seaman Edward 'Teddy' Sheean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 December 1942, 18-year-old Teddy Sheean made several profoundly courageous decisions when ordered to abandon his ship, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span>, after it came under aerial bombardment and torpedo attack from the Japanese, decisions that would protect, defend and ultimately save the lives of his crewmates. Sheean did not abandon ship. He turned back, returned to his gun, strapped himself to it and fired on the enemy aircraft that were strafing and killing his mates. Wounded, he persisted and shot down at least one of them, remaining at his weapon until he was killed and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> disappeared beneath the waves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Teddy Sheean is a hero. He was posthumously mentioned in dispatches—a great honour. But it has been consistently asserted by his many supporters that an MID does not adequately reflect Teddy's gallantry. Those supporters straddle all political divides. Chief amongst them are his tireless family, supported by former senator Guy Barnett, now the Tasmanian Minister for Veterans' Affairs. For decades, they have worked towards a comprehensive review of his case to prove just how valiant this young lad was and that he deserves to be awarded the Victoria Cross.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 they were sorely disappointed when a valour inquiry by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal found Sheean's actions did not meet the criteria for that award. Determined that a full merits based review was the only way to achieve justice, they pushed on. In 2018 the Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Noonan, wrote to Mr Barnett, saying that he had considered the matter and formed the view that there was no new evidence to support a review of Sheean's actions. In October that year, Mr Barnett applied to the tribunal, seeking a review of this decision by Vice Admiral Noonan. The review went ahead. It examined the story and the witness accounts in detail—process and precedent. It was the full merits based review that they had hoped for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on 23 July last year, the tribunal recommended to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Darren Chester, that the minister recommend to the sovereign that Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean be posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. I'll repeat that: the tribunal recommended to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Darren Chester—a member of this government, the Morrison government—that he recommend to the sovereign that Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean be posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Shortly after, Minister Chester advised the tribunal that he was comfortable with the recommendations and would be communicating with senior ministers, including the Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the way through this, Teddy's supporters have been most respectful of process, procedure and the reverence in which the VC is held. After all those years of work, it looked like Teddy was finally going to get the medal that he so well deserved. Then things went absolutely awry. The Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison, intervened. That's when things went bad. He rejected the recommendations of the tribunal and his own minister out of hand and refused to recommend to the Queen that the VC be awarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess one of the disappointing things from my point of view is that the Tasmanian senators on the other side of this chamber, as I understand, have also supported the position that Teddy Sheean be awarded the Victoria Cross. They're not silent in this; I understand they've pressed the Prime Minister to uphold that decision. But they have been silent in this chamber, so they should be speaking out and they should be supporting this decision. Defending this decision, the Prime Minister claimed that he had taken advice from Australia's military chiefs—not chief but chiefs, past and present. This is the very advice that the Senate demanded be tabled in this place by noon today—12 noon; that was six hours ago, actually. But Mr Morrison could not be bothered to meet that deadline and the documents have been received now, over six hours later—4½ hours late, defying a Senate motion. The only advice was one letter from General Angus Campbell that was already publicly available. There were no other letters. We wind back to the radio interview where the Prime Minister made a statement on ABC Tasmania on 26 May 2020. He said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly. I have taken advice from Australia's military chiefs'—that's plural, past and present. But all we've seen today is a letter that was already tabled in the other place a couple of days ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So where is all this advice that he sought? Was it actually official advice or was it just a few matey chats with the old boys? It's not good enough, Prime Minister—not good enough at all. Now, in a desperate attempt to save face, we have yet another review and not one provided for by any kind of prescribed process. It's a process that the Prime Minister just made up that is now going to determine whether or not that independent tribunal's position will be upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are baffled and we are angry that the Prime Minister would reject the recommendations of the independent tribunal. That's why the awards tribunal is set up; it's why it's independent—for the express purpose of providing him with expert, independent advice. But he didn't like that advice, so he goes off and develops another review committee. It's outrageous. It is incredibly unfair that an open and proper process could be ditched by the Prime Minister in favour of private advice—advice that we, the Australian people, have not been privy to because he has not provided that to this chamber today. In the end, this is about trust—the trust of the Australian people—that proper process is followed. Right now, people are seeing nothing but an arrogant Prime Minister who has made the worst kind of captain's call—the worst—and still we wait for justice for Ordinary Seaman Edward 'Teddy' Sheean.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I would like to associate myself with my colleague Senator Urquhart and her comments. As she said, Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean was only 18 years of age when he committed an act of extraordinary bravery. On 1 December 1942, when the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> was struck by torpedoes its personnel were ordered to abandon ship. Sheean, although severely wounded by attacking Japanese aircraft, returned and strapped himself to one of the ship's guns to engage enemy aircraft. He shot down at least one of the aircraft and, in so doing, was defending his fellow personnel, knowing that he would go down with that ship. It's possible that Mr Sheean's actions, in drawing away the fire of enemy aircraft, saved the lives of his fellow crew members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… most conspicuous gallantry, or daring or pre-eminent acts of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who know of Teddy Sheean's deeds and have followed the various inquiries into them—I've been here for 12 years and we've been debating this issue for longer than that—the Prime Minister's decision not to posthumously award him a VC is more than baffling. My Labor colleague Senator Urquhart moved for the documents relating to this decision to be produced, because this issue warrants public scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the face of it, the decision and explanations of those opposite make absolutely no sense. We had the Minister for Defence claim in this place that the 2019 review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal did not present any new evidence. Senator Reynolds also claimed that their inquiry was a review of the 2013 decision, not a full merits based inquiry. Guess what? She was wrong on both counts, and that's according to the chair of the DHAAT. Chair Mark Sullivan's decision to write to the minister regarding her misleading the Senate is not something I think he would have taken lightly. Yet he did it. Given Senator Reynolds' explanation was comprehensively torn apart by Mr Sullivan, the reasons for the Prime Minister's decision not to accept the independent tribunal's unanimous recommendation of 11 members remain a mystery. That's why the Senate ordered the production of these documents—to get to the bottom of the mystery, because there's nothing yet in the government's public statements or statements to this place that excuses or justifies the decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very surprised at comments in the media about this issue by the Liberal member for Braddon, Mr Pearce. Mr Pearce, I've got to say, is a fence-sitter and here's a classic example. I do recognise that Mr Pearce acknowledged that Mr Sheean's actions were worthy of a Victoria Cross, but he also stated that he thought the PM made the correct decision to have another review. Seriously, how long can you sit on the fence? That is the most ridiculous double standard you could come across. It's a particularly curious intervention given that Mr Pearce joined his Liberal colleagues in advocating for a VC to be posthumously awarded to Mr Sheean only a month earlier, saying he was satisfied with the process but not satisfied with the decision. I'm pretty disgusted that Mr Pearce would characterise Labor's advocacy as using this as a political football or conducting a chook raffle. Given that Mr Sheean was born on the north-west coast of Tasmania, I doubt Mr Pearce's constituents would appreciate his comments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we take this issue very seriously. All we're asking for is the due process and transparency that Mr Sheean, his relatives and advocates deserve. I can't really see how awarding Mr Sheean a VC would upset the Queen, as has been suggested by a certain high-ranking military official. The VC is about courage and gallantry. It's not about whether someone else, no matter who it is, might be upset by a person—in this case, Mr Sheean—receiving the VC. Labor's advocacy is simply for the Prime Minister to accept the advice provided by independent experts. The excuses this government continue to provide, including those by the minister, are wearing pretty thin—certainly on the north-west coast of Tasmania. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the Prime Minister's decision to announce yet another review of this matter is really worthy of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span> sketch. I can already hear the voice of <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span>'s Bernard asking the Prime Minister if he's suggesting a review of the review of the review. Refusing Teddy Sheean a posthumous VC, in the face of all the evidence and the DHAAT's findings, is a gross injustice to this young Tasmanian war hero. It is a slap in the face to his family, his supporters and the veteran community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I too rise to associate myself with the remarks of my Tasmanian Labor Senate colleagues Senators Urquhart and Bilyk and to demand that the decision of the independent Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal be upheld so that Teddy Sheean can finally be recognised for his brave and gallant service with the awarding of the Victoria Cross. Given that the Prime Minister has steadfastly refused to provide any real insight at all into his decision to unilaterally quash the findings of the tribunal, it is essential that the authority of this place be respected and that documents pertaining to this decision be tabled for every Australian to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't need to retell the incredible story of bravery and courage that underpins the legacy of Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean. It is a story known so well, particularly to Tasmanians and particularly to Tasmanians on the north-west coast—and so it ought to be—and it has spurred so many supporters to fight so long to see that Teddy is given the respect and recognition he deserves. The Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal has determined that no less than a Victoria Cross should be awarded to Teddy—an honour awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour, self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy, and an honour justly deserved. For a Prime Minister to intervene after a pre-eminent tribunal has made such an emphatic decision, based on the weight of overwhelming evidence, is extraordinary. It is precisely in circumstances such as this that the Australian people should be entitled to see the advice the Prime Minister relied upon to make such an extraordinary decision to set aside the decision of a tribunal set up specifically to deal with such matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite extraordinarily, the member for Braddon, Mr Gavin Pearce, stood up in the other place and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In my opinion, the Prime Minister has taken the right decision …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just let that sink in. The member for Braddon is on record in the parliament backing the Prime Minister's mishandling of this process. It is a mishandling that effectively amounts to a bizarre intervention to overrule the findings, recommendations and decisions of the Defence Honours and Awards Appeal Tribunal—simply extraordinary. And for what? We have not been given a reason why the Prime Minister would seek to intervene to overturn the decision of an expert tribunal specifically tasked with considering the merits or otherwise of awarding of a military honour. Its decision should be upheld and respected, not cast aside without explanation. Teddy Sheean and his family and supporters deserve so much better. Tasmanians deserve better. Indeed, all of our serving military personnel and our veterans deserve better.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually agree with the member for Braddon, Mr Pearce. I couldn't agree more. That's why the decision of the independent umpire should be respected. The only person kicking this matter around like a football is the person who refuses to respect the decision of the umpire who has called time on this matter, and that person is the Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who refuses to provide a proper explanation for doing so. And his actions are backed 100 per cent by the member for Braddon, Mr Gavin Pearce. I'm astonished—absolutely astonished. I would have thought that the local member for Braddon would be going in to bat for Teddy Sheean, his family and his supporters at every opportunity, not backing in a recalcitrant Prime Minister who has unquestionably done the wrong thing by failing to accept the decision of an independent tribunal. All Tasmanian members and senators should call on the Prime Minister to set aside his hastily formed review of a review, get on with upholding the appellate tribunal's decision and allow the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Teddy Sheean.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">NATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING REGULATOR (GOVERNANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2020</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I introduce the National Vocational Education and Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian vocational and education training (VET) sector is a vital engine that drives the Australian economy. The VET sector supports millions of students each year to obtain skills and expertise for success in future employment and further education. It provides agile pathways for people to enter the workforce, upskill or reskill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">VET qualifications and training need to be of a high standard to ensure they are trusted by students and employers and benefit the wider Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Delivering excellence in training lies at the heart of the Australian Government's skills agenda. That is why in October 2019, this Government announced reforms to the agency responsible for regulating the VET sector ­‑ the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed $18.1 million towards reforms to enhance ASQA's engagement with the VET sector and ensure its regulatory approach is fair, transparent and effective. The reforms respond to the Braithwaite and Joyce reviews which both called on ASQA to adopt a greater educative role and improve its regulatory approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first phase of reform is a rapid review of ASQA's governance, culture and processes which commenced in November 2019. The review is evaluating the effectiveness of ASQA's internal regulatory practices and processes, including how ASQA makes and reviews decisions. The review is due for completion in March this year and will inform a longer term program of improvements to support ASQA's continued evolution as a modern and effective regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the review is ongoing, initial work focussed on ASQA's governance. The regulatory experts undertaking the review evaluated the alignment of ASQA's current governance arrangements with best practice guidelines and arrangements of comparable bodies across Australia and recommended a revised model for ASQA to support effective, modern, fit‑for‑purpose governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The revised governance model in the Bill draws on best practice for Commonwealth regulators. It replaces the existing three commissioner structure with a single agency head, to be known as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ASQA. This will enable the CEO to perform a role more consistent with that of the head of an agency, including leading ASQA's long and short-term strategy and making top-level managerial decisions that determine the organisation's objectives, resources and policies. This will be supported by a revised organisational structure which will better allocate and clarify operational responsibilities and improve regulatory decision‑making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill establishes a statutory Expert Advisory Council to advise the CEO of ASQA. The Advisory Council fills a gap at the strategic level. Rather than representing particular stakeholder or jurisdictional interests, the Council will provide ASQA with access to expert strategic advice to help it to continuously improve as a regulator while maintaining its independent regulatory decision making. The Council will also create a mechanism for meaningful sector engagement and demonstrate ASQA's commitment to ongoing improvement and learning from the expertise of others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The members of the Advisory Council will bring to the table diverse skills such as expertise in regulation, communications, delivering training, and experience operating a training provider. To ensure the right mix of people and skills, I will seek out the views of the Ministerial Council for Skills before appointing the Chair or members to the Advisory Council. The Advisory Council will not be a decision-making body but rather a valuable source of strategic advice, a vehicle for confidential information-sharing and a strong foundation for stakeholder confidence in the regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The revised governance model will enhance ASQA's organisational capability and support best practice regulation, continuous improvement and effective engagement with the VET sector. The changes will facilitate a shift towards a regulatory approach which focuses on combining educating and engaging with registered providers to foster excellence, and compliance monitoring and enforcement. The revised governance arrangements will hold ASQA in good stead to address future challenges such as changes to its internal practice, enhancements to ASQA's educative role, and the significant reform anticipated in the VET sector over the coming years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also includes information sharing arrangements that support use of data collected by the National Centre for Vocational Education and Training (NCVER) under the Act. Improved information sharing will support governments and regulators, so that the diverse needs and requirements of all Australians, including groups with different needs, such as people with disability and those where English is not a first language, are considered in policy, funding and regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Promoting quality in the system will ensure that VET is valued as a legitimate and reliable pathway enabling individuals to achieve personal and professional development, and industry to access a work-ready skills base with consistent, relevant and nationally recognised knowledge and skills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Quality regulation is integral to ensuring the training system is equipped to deliver high quality student outcomes and to efficiently adapt to changing skill needs, labour market fluctuations and developing technologies. These reforms will benefit not only ASQA, but also the providers they regulate, VET students, graduates, employers, and the Australian economy at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is another critical step in this Government's reform process to support ASQA's continued evolution as a transparent and balanced regulator that engages effectively with stakeholders and builds quality in the VET sector. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are also a number of minor, unrelated measures outlined in the Bill, to reduce regulatory burden or make other improvements to regulation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Main measures</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements three main measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">First</span>, the Bill amends a number of foundational medical device definitions to support the closer alignment of the regulation of medical devices in Australia with the EU framework, and more broadly with the global regulation of medical devices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, the Bill ensures that the definition of 'medical device' expressly covers software, implants and reagents. This reduces uncertainty around the definition of medical devices as those intended to be used for the prediction or prognosis of disease, the investigation, replacement or modification of a pathological process or state, the support of conception and the in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body for a specific medical purpose. The Bill also brings the 'accessory' and 'system or procedure pack' definitions more into line with the EU terms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes are designed to assist efforts to improve access for Australian consumers to new medical devices, by identifying Australia as a market that is closely aligned with the EU and for which access may be sought by device manufacturers and sponsors without delay, following EU approvals of their products. They also support recommendation 20 of the Expert Panel Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation, agreed to by the Australian Government in its Response to the Review in September 2016, in relation to aligning the regulation of medical devices in Australia with the EU, wherever possible. These changes improve the clarity of these definitions which, in turn, supports better regulatory compliance for industry sponsors and manufacturers of medical devices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Secondly</span>, the Bill enables the Secretary to provide scientific advice to an applicant about prescription and over the counter medicines – before they submit a formal application to the TGA for marketing approval. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In some instances, it can be difficult for sponsors of medicines to determine the nature of information needed to support an application for registration, particularly in relation to whether a bioequivalence study is needed for a generic prescription medicine or what is required to justify not submitting a bioequivalence study. This uncertainty may risk sponsors investing considerable time and resources on evidence that is not needed, or providing insufficient evidence resulting in applications being rejected. Both instances may delay consumer access to new medicines and savings to the public through availability of generic brands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To better support the timely availability of medicines for Australians, the Bill allows the applicant to request non-binding, scientific advice on prescribed aspects of the safety, quality or efficacy of a registrable medicine. While it is anticipated that initially this will focus on bioequivalence issues, the new power would allow a range of matters relevant to safety, quality or efficacy to be prescribed in the regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The advice will be non-binding in that an applicant who requests such advice may apply for registration of a medicine regardless of the advice given in relation to the medicine. However, the TGA will be required to have regard to such advice when evaluating a medicine for registration. This will ensure that, in addition to helping medicine sponsors to have greater confidence about the requirements for an application, the advice will also directly support and streamline any subsequent application for registration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Thirdly</span>, the Bill introduces a data protection regime for assessed listed medicines – these are lower risk complementary medicines that are assessed in relation to their efficacy claims before they are given marketing approval. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I'd like to add the name of Senator Rice as a co-sponsor of this motion. I, and also on behalf of Senator Rice, move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That Items 4 to 7 of schedule 1 of the Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits) Amendment Rules (No. 2) 2020, made under Schedule 1 of, be disallowed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware that there are differing views on the two issues contained in the disallowance motion. Accordingly, I ask that at the conclusion of this debate the question on this motion be divided with respect to item 4 and items 5 to 7 so that senators may vote differently on item 4, relating to sovereign entities, and items 5 to 7, relating to the higher-education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to my motion that would disallow items 4 to 7 of the government's Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits) Amendment Rules (No. 2) 2020. These are the amendments the government introduced on 1 May, which further tightened the eligibility for the JobKeeper program. I do this because there are thousands of Australians who deserve better from this government—their government. The COVID-19 health pandemic has rocked the foundations of Australia and of global society. It has closed successful businesses of all shapes and sizes across all industries, left millions of people around the world unemployed, and killed over 100 people in Australia and 400,000 across the world. It will leave a permanent mark on the lives of so many of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During periods like this, periods of unprecedented social and economic upheaval, the people of Australia look to us, their democratic leaders, for guidance, for leadership and for support. Throughout this period Labor has consistently called for action to support the economy, in order to protect jobs and to help Australian workers, businesses, families and communities through what has been a once-in-a-generation period of instability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the origin story of JobKeeper. We know that at the outset the government really just wanted to throw Australians on the Centrelink queues. It was only because of continued pressure from the Labor opposition, the crossbench, the Australian trade union movement and the business community that this government announced that it would introduce a wage subsidy scheme, one that would give companies and workers certainty and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced JobKeeper, the Treasurer said: 'Australians know that their government has their back.' But it very quickly became apparent that JobKeeper would not have the backs of hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families, which is why, when it was legislated, Labor moved amendments to ensure that key groups of workers were protected, including over one million casual workers; gig workers in transport and other areas; workers in the arts, in education and in local governments around the country; and migrant workers and international students, who pay tax and who came here in good faith. These amendments were defeated by a government uninterested in helping taxpaying Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, we've urged the Treasurer repeatedly to use his extraordinary powers to extend JobKeeper payments to those left behind. Instead, he has chosen to exclude even more workers. This program, which was meant to support workers, to keep them connected to their employers and, in turn, stimulate the economy, has instead been made so piecemeal that it is failing in its purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government promised an economic compact with the Australian people. It promised to support some six million workers—a number they trumpeted. Now, after their accounting blunder was exposed, we know it is just three million. Australian workers have been short-changed by this heartless government, which has broken its compact with the people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The JobKeeper program began on 30 March 2020, but, on 1 May, the government moved to exclude Australian workers in universities and Australian workers whose companies are ultimately owned by a foreign sovereign entity. It was an outrageous and cruel stroke of a pen that has left thousands and thousands of families out in the cold. The higher education sector, a sector that employs roughly 260,000, may, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see some 21,000 workers unemployed. These workers include cleaners, security staff, caterers and administrators working across Australia's universities, and the academics, the many that teach so many important people across the economy. They are workers in our suburbs and in our regions, the places hardest hit by the economic turmoil of the pandemic. These workers have done nothing wrong and yet the government has now on three occasions changed the regulations to make it impossible for universities to meet the thresholds for JobKeeper, depriving these hardworking Australians of the support they need during this shutdown. I want to commend the National Tertiary Education Union, their leadership and their president, Alison Barnes, for their steadfast advocacy for these workers, doing everything they can to keep them in secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus now on those Australian workers who are shut out of the sovereign entity provisions. Let's be very clear about what the government has done: in 2018 they approved the sale of Qantas's Q Catering to dnata, a catering company owned by the Emirates airlines, which is itself owned by the UAE government. Now they want to turn around and effectively punish these workers for this decision. It is no fault of these workers what the ultimate ownership structure of the company is. It is a well-known feature of the aviation industry around the world that there are high levels of government ownership. This is how aviation works. In any case, it should not matter. They are Australian workers. They pay income tax, like everyone else, to this government. They expect the government to treat them equally and fairly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper is an Australian wage subsidy. The money is going into the pockets of Australian workers, not foreign governments. This government, instead, wants to split hairs about ownership structures and shareholdings. Qantas workers are getting JobKeeper. Even Swissport, an aviation firm employing thousands of Australians, opaquely owned by the Chinese government—through HNA's takeover—are getting JobKeeper. These aviation workers are getting this support because Australian workers are Australian workers. Full stop. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dnata employs over 5,500 workers across nine Australian airports, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin, Coolangatta, Avalon, Perth and Cairns. Many of them worked previously for Qantas, before it sold its catering business to dnata. These workers were amongst the very first hit by the coronavirus lockdowns, when the government made the decision to shut aviation down. It was hard, but they accepted this was a public health emergency. Subsequently, they were told by their employer that it would be okay, that they would get JobKeeper and they would have jobs on the other side of this crisis. Dnata had to stand down 90 per cent of their workforce and employ only a skeleton crew. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then JobKeeper was announced, and the company was 'invited to apply'. Some workers even received payments from their employers in the expectation they would be receiving JobKeeper. Many cancelled jobseeker applications, looking forward to getting back to work and the certainty that JobKeeper payments would provide them and their families. They were playing by the rules, only to have the government move the goalposts on them mid-game. The lunacy—that workers who hand you the meal on a flight can receive the support, but the workers who make the meal are denied it. It is hard to describe this situation as anything short of these workers being double-crossed by their own government. Cancelling their applications has cost them time and money they can ill-afford. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the incredible work of the Transport Workers Union of Australia and the Australian Services Union, who represent these workers, and, importantly, the workers themselves who are standing up. The workers at dnata have no control over who owns their company. They work for a company that is sovereign owned by another country. But they are Australian workers, and after a lifetime of work and paying tax they deserve our support. The decision to exclude these workers is harsh and lacks compassion and logic. It impacts not only these workers but also their partners, families and communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision has created such unnecessary and harmful stress to workers and their families. It's even more harsh after a $60-billion JobKeeper accounting error by the government was revealed only a few weeks ago. I'm pleased to acknowledge that at least one member of the government, the member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, has joined with me in supporting the case of the dnata workers. He acknowledges, as do many members and senators, that these workers could easily be included within the original funding envelope provided for the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a heartless decision that hurts Australians, Australians like Nelly and Darlene. Nelly was made a permanent employee of Q Catering in 1980. She took pride in her job. She says in writing to me:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sacrificing time away from actual family for all of those years to be able to contribute to something greater, knowing I wasn’t a burden on society also filled me with satisfaction.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have never asked nor received family assistance from the government. I didn't ever plan to. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, as of March this year, we were all asked to 'step down' from our jobs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">My grandfather served in world war one and world war two. My grand uncle died on the battlefield in Polygon wood Belgium 26/09/1917 serving in world war one. My father passed away last year from illness received serving with the Australian Navy in Korea, yet you don't consider me to be Australian enough to receive JobKeeper. Please explain what your requirements are to be classed Australian. The Australian government allowed this sale to go through yet are punishing and sacrificing us for their poor decisions. You can help us to right this wrong. Please give us JobKeeper.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the Prime Minister likes to talk about quiet Australians. He likes to talk about a fair go. If you have a go, you get a go. Where is the go for Nelly, Darlene and their families? Where is the backing of these quiet Australians? If the JobKeeper allowance is not for them, it's not worthy of the name and would be more appropriately called 'JobFaker'. And this government is not worthy of a name either.</span>

As a part of this response, the $70 billion JobKeeper program provides unprecedented support to millions of Australians. Eligibility has focused on maximising the reach of the JobKeeper program, while ensuring the program is able to be implemented as quickly and efficiently as possible and while remaining sustainable.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  The Greens support this disallowance and specifically I want to talk to supporting disallowing item 4 of these regulations from the coronavirus economic response package. We also support the disallowance of items 5 to 7. My colleague Senator Faruqi spoke extensively to this in her own disallowance last week. I associate myself with the remarks she made about those items which were related to the higher education sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time when the coalition liked to talk about 'team Australia'. But they're not talking about being a team now that we're in a crisis. Now that Australian workers are in the lurch, the coalition are back-pedalling as fast as they can. Now when it really matters, people in Australia who are doing it tough are finding out whose side the coalition is really on. This government might be willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to a former mining executive to fly around the country but they're not willing to support Australians who are doing it tough and communities that are struggling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular workers that I want to talk about tonight are some of the workers in the aviation industry. We know the aviation industry is in a bit of difficulty at the moment with this pandemic, because, as we know, most people aren't flying. There are very few flights either domestically or internationally. We're in a situation, as states lift their restrictions, where we may see an increase in domestic flights, but international flights are not likely to return to the levels that we saw pre crisis in a particularly short amount of time—if, indeed, they ever do. So we've got a situation with aviation workers. There are tens of thousands of them who are out of work because of the pandemic. These are just the types of workers that the government's JobKeeper package was designed to support—people who, because their industry was being badly affected by this pandemic, were not able to be in work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've got a particular cohort of workers who aren't being supported: the workers employed by dnata. Before this crisis, dnata handled 300,000 tonnes of cargo and supported more than seven million passengers. There are 5,500 workers, and the government is not supporting them. The government is also not supporting the hardworking workers of Cabin Services Australia, who do all the cleaning of cabins and preparation of flights across the country. I met some of these workers out on the lawns of Parliament House last week, and they could not understand why they were being singled out. They are proud of their work. As politicians, we fly around the country a lot. Every time we have flown on a flight, it's those workers at Cabin Services Australia who have done the hard work and cleaned the cabins to make sure that they are safe and clean for us to fly in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why aren't these workers being supported by JobKeeper? Because their companies are owned by a foreign government. But that makes no difference to them. In fact, in the case of dnata it's only a matter of different corporate takeovers now that the company is owned by a foreign government. It makes no difference to the workers. They are employed here in Australia and have been paying taxes here in Australia. They are just like all the other Australian workers who are being supported by JobKeeper. By supporting these workers with JobKeeper, we're not propping up foreign governments; we are supporting Australians who are out of work during this pandemic. Not supporting these workers has a terrible impact on them, their families and communities around the country; it's a huge impact. Supporting them means food on plates, mortgage payments and being able to pay the bills in the midst of this crisis. This pandemic is hard enough for people without the coalition throwing workers under a bus. The tragedy is that there is a real opportunity for this government to act and to make a real difference in people's lives. The government could step up and provide support, and support these workers in this crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that we need to have a serious look at the sustainability of the aviation industry after the COVID pandemic, or whatever situation we're in as the COVID virus plays its way out throughout the world, and that we need to have a serious look at aviation in the context of the climate crisis as well. But leaving workers in the lurch on the arbitrary basis of their company being owned by a foreign government is not the way to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that we should take action domestically to ensure that we have two viable airlines connecting up our rural communities as we come out of this crisis and to ensure that all existing workers in the aviation sector are looked after. We support the calls from the Transport Workers Union for a national plan for aviation, and I want to thank the Transport Workers Union for the work that they have been doing to try to support the workers in this industry. The TWU are calling for a two-airline model; government equity in the airlines to ensure long-term stability; accessible and affordable services for regions; protection and promotion of regional jobs; JobKeeper for all aviation workers; workers to get the same pay for the same job; safe supply chains and regulation of airports; and capped CEO salaries. We support those calls. This is a crisis, and it requires a real response from government that doesn't leave people behind. It requires a response that doesn't allow one of our domestic carriers to go into administration. The Greens are calling for the government to, if required, take steps for public ownership of Virgin as a step to deal with this crisis. However, of course the support that the government is giving should come with conditions. We think it should support worker representation on the board and no bonuses for executives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public ownership is an important way for government to support workers through this crisis, making sure that an aviation crisis doesn't exacerbate the jobs crisis that we face. Public ownership is also a way for government to support airlines in tackling the environmental challenges we face. In the long term, airlines must reduce their emissions if we're going to stay within our carbon budget and have a safe future on this planet so we can continue to live on it. Any public ownership stake must ensure that airlines live up to their commitments to reduce emissions under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. We've heard reports that airlines are lobbying to have their targets made easier, even as they ask for government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be clear. Government needs to be supporting the aviation industry. Governments must support workers through a national aviation plan that includes public ownership when necessary. It must ensure that airlines meet their emission targets. But in the context of this disallowance tonight, what we must ensure is that workers are not left behind—that hardworking workers in the aviation industry, who have been paying their taxes and working hard, like every other Australian worker, deserve to be supported like other Australian workers have with the JobKeeper scheme. For that reason, the Greens strongly support this disallowance motion tonight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  This disallowance motion on the Coronavirus Economic Response Package (Payments and Benefits) Amendment Rules (No. 2) 2020 has created a significant amount of torment for both Senator Roberts and me. I stated from the outset that the repercussions the coronavirus will have on Australia and the rest of the globe will be potentially felt for generations. One of those industries that felt the immediate impact of this virus was aviation—and its affiliate industries. The fate of dnata employees was first brought to my attention by FIVEaa announcer Leon Byner several weeks ago. I made a commitment to Leon that I would look into this. I thank Labor Senator Tony Sheldon, who has been a very strong advocate for the workers of dnata. He has given me a very raw insight into what these employees are going through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber will never quite know how much anger I felt when I heard that we lost another wholly owned Australian business called Q Catering to the United Arab Emirates. You see, many of these employees started their careers employed by Qantas until it was sold to Emirates, a UAE state owned government company. Emirates have posted 32 consecutive years of profit. In their 2019-20 annual report, they posted a revenue of US$28.3 billion. Unfortunately for these Australian workers—and let's be upfront about this—they might work for a foreign government company, but they are Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The emergency legislation that was passed by Labor and the coalition government to safeguard jobs under the JobKeeper program prohibits Australian and foreign governments from accessing the JobKeeper program. I'll say it again: the JobKeeper program cannot be accessed by foreign governments and, equally, it cannot be accessed by Australian governments, which also includes local councils. This was passed by the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals. The disallowance motion that has been put forward today is somewhat of a false hope for the workers of dnata. To them: I sincerely apologise to you and your colleagues if you had hopes that this disallowance motion would give you access to the JobKeeper program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the questions I asked both the government and Labor related to the return of domestic and international travel. As Australian states determine their relaxation of domestic travel, there is an expectation that flights will resume in some form of capacity over the coming months. As for international travel, that's not likely to restart more broadly until we either find a cure for the coronavirus or somehow everyone miraculously recovers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the decision process that Senator Roberts and I used for our determination. The vast majority of the nearly 6,000 dnata workers here in Australia will not have a job to return to once the JobKeeper payments end on 27 September. As I stated months ago, our aviation industry will barely be open for domestic, let alone international, travel. This is going to be a complete blow to many dnata employees, but I'm being completely upfront and honest with you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have confirmed with the government that many dnata employees will qualify for jobseeker, which, at the moment, still includes the coronavirus supplement of $550 per fortnight and gives recipients a total of $1,100 per fortnight. Depending on an individual's circumstances, parents may be eligible for other supplements like family tax benefit part A, of up to $186.20 per fortnight for a child up to 12, or family tax benefit part B, which can offer up to $158.34 each fortnight for children under five. Jobseekers can also make an application for Commonwealth rent assistance. I also want to point out that people on social security payments will also be eligible for two $750 economic support payments, the second of which will be paid following 13 July. It is also important that anyone caught in these horrible circumstances knows that their ability to access jobseeker will not be asset tested and that the partner threshold has been lifted to $79,788 per annum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always tried to maintain a responsible position when it comes to spending taxpayers' money. There have been some tough choices made by the Morrison government, and I can assure you: some of those I agree with and others I don't. But we've all had to make tough choices these past few months, and I sense that there are going to be many more over the next 12 months as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All employees who have lost their jobs or were ineligible for the JobKeeper program have my absolute sympathy at this moment in time. I am very conscious of the needs of these workers, and I'm also aware that my party's head office has employed one of these workers who lost their job at the Brisbane airport. Taryn has been with my head office now for a fortnight, and I would encourage any business that is looking for employees right now to consider closely the former employees of dnata and our airport staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say this to all Australians: I will do everything in my power to ensure that we rebuild jobs in this country and that we stop selling our profitable businesses to foreign governments and overseas companies. And I will continue to fight with the same vigour to ensure that Australian jobs go to Australian workers moving forward. I want to acknowledge Senator Sheldon for his determined representation of the aviation industry, but, on this occasion, One Nation will not support the disallowance motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I rise to make a very short statement. It seems to me perverse that there are Australian workers who, for no reason that they had any control over, find themselves in a situation where they are working for a foreign company and yet are not able to get access to the JobKeeper payments. This is not money that goes to the company. It's money that goes to the workers. In some sense, it tells you how the Liberal Party think. They think through the lens of a business. They're looking at this from a business perspective and saying: 'How do we support businesses? This one's a foreign business, and, therefore it doesn't warrant support.' I understand that, but this particular payment goes straight to the worker.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  The COVID scare has been having a massive impact on our country. We know that. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to express my empathy to the people who have either been put out of work or have limited work. There's enormous stress on people—we know that—and especially in the airline industry. It has been decimated because there is such close contact between people when we fly on an airline or mix in an airline terminal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the dnata people. They are fine people, fine Australians, who must be feeling devastated to be in such a solid industry and to have been sold out by Qantas, to have been sold out by the government that allowed that sale to a foreign company, a foreign government. It is very stressful, I'm sure. There's a lot of worry, a lot of concern and a lot of pressure. People want to be heard, and people also need support. We'll come to that support in a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to compliment Senator Sheldon for his sincerity, his strength and his advocacy for the TWU and their campaign. I also want to acknowledge Senators Sterle and Gallacher, former TWU officials, who have also been strong in supporting Senator Sheldon. We've listened to Senator Sheldon, and we compliment him for the way he has brought his argument forward—the facts, and also his approach, which was very respectful and sincere. We also went to the government and asked them for their opinions, their views and their data. As Senator Hanson and I always do, we listened to people, to get the data and to get the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we do not like the sale of this company to any foreigner, let alone a foreign government. It's one of the core industries in our country. It is, though, a very difficult decision. It's a very difficult issue. Senator Hanson pointed out—and I'm not going to go through the details of Senator Hanson's speech, because Senator Sheldon wants to put this to a vote tonight—the comparable after-tax benefits from jobseeker and JobKeeper. But I also want to point out, as I think Senator Hanson did, that JobKeeper ends in September. This program—and I disagree with Senator Patrick—is not for businesses. It's for people to maintain connection with the businesses, so I don't accept that criticism of the government from Senator Patrick. It is to maintain that connection. That connection is going to be severed after September. That's it. It won't last any longer. International air travel and even a lot of domestic travel won't recover by then. So I think it's heartless to give people false hope. I’m certainly not accusing Senator Sheldon of giving people false hope. I know what he's doing, and I admire him for that, but I think we need to be straight with these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'd like to do is to ask the government to think about its response. Maybe we need something other than JobKeeper and jobseeker—we need a 'job-restarter'. Taiwan—and I mentioned this to the government, back in March—has had amazing results. What they did was isolate the vulnerable, isolate the sick and let everyone else get back to work. That's what we could be doing. There has been virtually no impact on the Taiwan economy. They've had one-fifteenth of the deaths we've had, and yet they've got a similar population, they're very close to China and have a highly dense population. Instead of isolating everyone and separating everyone, by isolating the few that have got it, the few that are vulnerable, and letting the rest get back to work, they've done a remarkable job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do is get this country back to work. If that was the level of performance when we led the world in per capita income back in the 1900s and 1920s—we were No. 1, but we're sliding out of the top 10 as a result of COVID—the target, I hope, should not be just to get back to where we were pre COVID; we need to get back to our full realistic potential. That's why I say we need to get 'JobRestarter' going—a comprehensive program that restores low-cost energy, restores infrastructure, creates a proper and fair taxation system, and creates an environment where more Australian businesses will survive and not have to sell out in the future. We need to end the stress on the economy, end the stress on people's health and end the lack of security. We need a realistic return not just to where we were pre COVID but to where our potential is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to remember that taxpayers are footing the bill. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I compliment Senator Sheldon again—and Senator Sterle and Senator Gallacher. As Senator Hanson said, though, on this occasion we will not be voting with them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  The easing of coronavirus restrictions has led to a renewed sense of optimism for our country, for businesses to resume trading, for workers to return to work and for Australians to enjoy their lives. The latest round of relaxed restrictions means we can get back to restaurants and pubs, which is not only a great reward for the vast majority who have followed the rules but also fantastic for those businesses to be able to reopen and start getting back to business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, travel restrictions within our state were lifted in time for the Queen's Birthday long weekend, and many people took the chance to visit friends and family in different regions or to go to the shack. This is welcome news for Tasmanian businesses across the state, particularly in the tourism and hospitality industries, who just two months ago were staring down the barrel of potentially six months without any trade at all. I want to commend the Tasmanian business community tonight. They deserve so much credit for the sacrifice they've made in diligently playing their part to prevent the spread of this infectious disease. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all recognise that recovery for our economy, jobs market and business sector is going to take a massive combined effort. That's why over the last six weeks I have been busy engaging with local councils, business leaders and Tasmanians on how they think we can get Tasmania back in business. Tasmania needs its leaders and elected representatives to help develop a clear plan to assist businesses in the recovery process, encourage new developments and create new jobs for Tasmanians. I have received incredibly valuable feedback from Tasmanians who have provided me with their thoughts and ideas on how we can work together to recover and expand the state's economic prospects. For example, Tasmania's agriculture industry is a major contributor to our economy and something that we're extremely proud of in our state. This industry will play a major role in recovery, with the potential to increase production and seek new market opportunities for our produce. Further investment in the state's irrigation infrastructure will assist with the growth of this important industry, create jobs and meet the nation's demand for fresh produce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government's record on investing in water infrastructure projects in Tasmania speaks for itself, with the Australian and Tasmanian Liberal governments jointly investing $170 million to deliver the next tranche of new irrigation schemes. With the Morrison government last year creating the National Water Grid Authority, there is also a great opportunity to leverage that authority's expertise not only to pursue further irrigation investment but also to droughtproof the east coast of Tasmania, which suffered through record dry conditions last year. I look forward to pursuing that opportunity with state and federal colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Tasmanians this crisis has also highlighted our nation's reliance on imported products. The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare just how dependent we are as a nation on foreign markets. International trade and forging strong relations with other nations is extremely important for Australia as a member of the global community, but that doesn't mean we should shy away from opportunities to make or grow things we may not have previously produced. What's more, economic threats made by Beijing in response to Australia's push for an independent inquiry into coronavirus have highlighted our need to diversify markets and address our overdependence on China. These are all things we need to consider as we continue to forge ahead with recovery efforts. Tasmania also must be open to development in infrastructure opportunities, both large and small. Of course, projects must be sensible and appropriate. But it's clear that, if we are to bounce back strongly, we can't afford to be seen by the investment community as an antidevelopment state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The announcement earlier this week that Project Marinus, the proposed second interconnector across Bass Strait, has been identified as one of the 15 major projects the Morrison coalition government has given priority status to is a welcome development. This project would enable another generation of hydroelectricity development in our state, as well as other renewable energy projects, providing a huge economic and job creation boost for Tasmania. Project Marinus and the Battery of the Nation initiative to grow Tasmania's renewable energy capacity will inject over $7 billion into the Tasmanian economy and create thousands of jobs to support Tasmania's renewable energy sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to keep development ideas coming forward in Tasmania so that the private sector can invest with confidence and create jobs for Tasmanians. I will continue, over the coming weeks and months, to seek those ideas and work hard to get Tasmania back in business.</span>

The extraordinary soils of the north-west and the near-perfect growing climate, plus the hard yards worked by hundreds of farmers, produce great potatoes. Thousands of people rely on the potato industry for their livelihoods. They have done so for nearly 200 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1826 the Van Diemen's Land Company sent the first shipload of potatoes from north-west Tasmania to Sydney. Today that industry supports the lives and families of around 320 employees at Simplot's Ulverstone potato-processing plant, around 200 employees at McCain's Smithton plant and more than 165 local growers that supply more than 300,000 tonnes of potatoes each year to the Simplot plant alone. McCain have another large plant in Ballarat that employs over 500 people. Of course, there are also all the associated indirect jobs in transport, logistics and shipping. These plants process potatoes into a variety of frozen products, value-adding enormously to the raw product. They are typical of highly productive regional industries that provide a substantial number of jobs vital to regional economies—vital to the lives, wellbeing and happiness of literally thousands of people. It's an industry that I'm passionate about and it's the kind of industry we need more of if we're to have jobs and opportunities in regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our manufacturing industries—industries we need to nurture and invest in to ensure that we have the resources as a nation to provide for our population and to feed them. The pandemic has also thrown industries around the world into crisis, with restaurants and food outlets closing down for months and no longer buying product, creating mountains of surplus food. Tasmanian potato growers and workers at our vegetable-processing plants are rightly stressed about the fluctuation in global commodity prices caused by the coronavirus. And, recently, the farmers and workers in the potato industry in north-west Tasmania and Ballarat became deeply concerned that a $1 billion COVID-19 assistance package to European potato farmers could see large quantities of cheap french fries dumped on Australian supermarket shelves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely understand the fear and anxiety that these workers and farmers experience over this issue. This fear caused farmers and workers to rally recently, along with the community, at a socially distant rally in Smithton and Ballarat organised by the AMWU, my union. They were unusual events, with many people showing up in their cars and cheering through their car window so they could stay COVID safe. In Smithton I told those workers and farmers I would take their concerns to this place and make sure my colleagues here understand their anxiety. This industry is vital for employment and the economy on the north-west coast of Tasmania, an area hit hard by COVID-19 and already doing it tough before the pandemic. We are talking about the livelihoods of hundreds of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, Labor has called on the government to ensure that no worker and no industry gets left behind in the wake of the virus restrictions, which have had a severe impact on the frozen chip industry. We have implored the government to ensure that the Anti-Dumping Commission is ready to act in case of the dumping of any products into Australia under the guise of lower global prices. That means ensuring the commission is adequately resourced and able to respond swiftly should the need arise. It was Labor that established the Anti-Dumping Commission, and we're rightly proud of that achievement, but its existence has not been sufficient to allay the fears of these workers and farmers, simply because the immediate impact of a product dumping could see their livelihoods wiped out before the commission's processes have an effect. They could quite easily become collateral damage in a market that is overwhelmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have since been reassured by the Europeans that they will not be dumping their product, but we must remain vigilant. We must check when we go to the freezer at the supermarket. We must do everything we can to encourage investment in vibrant regional industries to lead us out of this economic crisis. One worker said, 'The last thing we need is a kick in the guts by cheap imports.' To the McCain potato workers, the potato farmers and the AMWU I say: good on you for drawing this to the attention of the nation, and please stay vigilant. We stand with you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on protecting our forests, particularly forests that are part of the lands of the Wurundjeri, the Taungurong, the Gunai Kurnai and the Bidwell peoples. I acknowledge the traditional owners of these lands and their elders past, present and emerging. I acknowledge that these are stolen lands and that there has been no consent to the logging and destruction of these forests of this First Nations forest heritage. And I pledge to work alongside First Nations people until we have achieved justice for them and for country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the Federal Court handed down a landmark legal decision. It found that VicForests, the Victorian government logging agency, had broken the law in its logging of, and plans to log, 66 different areas of forest. The court found that the state and federal government were failing to protect two threatened animals: the tiny Leadbeater's possum, of which there are only around 2,000 left in the world, and the greater glider. The court found that logging was killing these animals and helping to send them closer and closer to extinction. I applaud and congratulate Friends of Leadbeater's Possum, who brought the legal case, their amazing legal team at Environment Justice Australia and the thousands of people who helped fund the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leadbeater's possums, called 'wallert' in the Taungurong language, can fit in the palm of your hand. They're very fussy about where they nest. They need hollows that are only found in mountain ash trees that are over a hundred years old. They are critically endangered, which means they are facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater gliders can fly from tree to tree. They are the largest of the gliding possums, with big teddy bear ears and a long fluffy tail. Being vulnerable means that they are facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future. It's estimated that almost a quarter of the greater gliders in Victoria were killed in last summer's fires. You would think that this would have been enough for governments to realise that the logging of the forest where these animals live should stop. You would think that, when the Federal Court says that the logging has been illegal, state and federal governments would realise that, as with whaling, the game is up. You would think they'd realise that it's time to scrap our logging laws—the regional forest agreements—and strengthen our environment protection laws to protect our wildlife. You would think they'd realise that it's time for our forests to be left in peace to grow old, to be protected for their wildlife, their water, their carbon, their value for tourism and recreation, their beauty and their ability to inspire and soothe and rejuvenate the human spirit. You would think they'd realise that it's time for the wood products industry to complete the shift to being 100 per cent based on plantations, up from the current 88 per cent—but no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I put a motion to the Senate calling upon the government to accept the Federal Court decision that the logging was illegal and to take immediate urgent action to ensure Australia's native forests are protected. The government and Labor voted against the motion. The Labor Party said that they support the benefits that flow from sustainable management of our native forests and support regional forest agreements—that is, they support ongoing logging, ongoing forest destruction and the ongoing deaths of endangered animals. I've been campaigning for the protection of our forests for over 30 years and I am angry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we do? The other senators in this place are not listening. We need to make them listen. I applaud the brave protesters who stopped the logging in forests across Victoria last week. I applaud forest campaigners across the country who have been inspired by the Federal Court decision and are now working on legal actions in their own states, and I call upon anyone listening to join these campaigns. You might like to learn more and share what you've learnt. You might like to donate to cover legal costs, to take time to visit these wonderful forests or to join actions on the ground. I call on you to help make our democracy work for us and for our forests, and to elect more people to this place who will vote for forest protection. People in the seat of Eden-Monaro have a chance to do that by voting for the Greens candidate Cathy Griff in the by-election that will be held next month. Above all, I urge you to not give up hope. Keep campaigning and keep fighting for our forests. Eventually, together, we will win.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  Last night, in the adjournment debate, I was telling a compelling story about how the Western Australian Labor environment minister, Stephen Dawson, is the latest soft target for environmental alarmism in my home state of Western Australia. I'd like to continue that sorry tale. In November 2017, approximately nine months after appearing before the committee, Professor Black and former senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne wrote to Minister Dawson, repeating their alarmist and unsubstantiated claims. They requested he instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a section 46 review of Yara Pilbara's operating licence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1986 states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Minister considers that the implementation conditions relating to a proposal, or any of them, should be changed (whether because of changes to the proposal authorised under section 45C or for any other reason), the Minister may request the Authority to inquire into and report on the matter within such period as is specified in the request.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 46(6) requires the EPA report to include:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) a recommendation on whether or not the implementation conditions to which the inquiry relates, or any of them, should be changed; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a totally unnecessary step by the WA Labor environment minister but a heavy regulatory impost on Yara Pilbara, especially because the EPA had previously analysed Yara Pilbara's emissions and concluded it was unlikely that the predicted quantities of nitrogen oxide and ammonia that would be emitted from the TANPF would have a significant impact on rock art in the surrounding areas. However, in September 2019, after conducting an inquiry and acknowledging that Yara Pilbara already uses best-practice pollution control technology to minimise air emissions, the EPA recommended that the minister impose stronger licence conditions to protect Burrup Peninsula rock art from Yara's emissions. This advice was swiftly acted upon by Minister Dawson, when he issued Ministerial Statement No. 1121 on Christmas Eve in 2019, imposing stricter conditions on Yara Pilbara's facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does all of this mean? Despite having already employed best-practice pollution control technology to minimise air emissions, Yara Pilbara must compare its operations against industry best practice every four years or when directed to do so by the WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. The practical implications of these new licence conditions mean Yara Pilbara could at any time be non-compliant with its operating licence, based on a subjective assessment of what constitutes best practice. Their licence to operate can now only be considered conditional, and all resource companies considering investment in Western Australia now need to consider the additional risk of having potential licence changes imposed upon them without scientific or evidentiary cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is this a bad outcome for Yara Pilbara; it is a bad omen for all future resource project investment in my home state of Western Australia. Just when our mining and resource sector has been the lifeboat for the Australian economy during this pandemic, the actions of the WA Labor government have unnecessarily increased uncertainty for this critical part of our state and national economy, all because Minister Dawson fails to stand up to scientific alarmism—those in the community who masquerade as experts, building an argument by quoting out of context, selectively choosing data and misusing science. The objective of this alarmism is to obstruct and to derail industrial development across WA's far north. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message tonight is a simple one. WA's resource sector should be alert and alarmed. This case study regarding Yara Pilbara and Professor David Black introduces a new, heightened degree of risk for existing and future resource projects in Western Australia. The WA Labor government and Minister Dawson have emboldened the activist movement and put at risk the employment opportunities of thousands. Potentially no resource company is safe from the campaign tactics and trickery of these activists. So be prepared. The activists will quickly move to their next victim, stir up the community, bully companies and the regulator into submission, and wrap job and wealth-creating resource companies in more and more red tape. WA's resource sector has been warned, and it's time for WA's resource sector to stand up and be counted.</span>

It follows the recent closure of online sites <span style="font-style:italic;">10 daily</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">BuzzFeed News Australia</span> this month and mounts on top of more than 150 Australian newsrooms that have shut down since January 2019. Local journalists play an essential role in breaking news and telling the stories that matter to their communities, particularly in regional Australia. These newspapers have a rich connection to their community, in some cases going back further than a century. North Queensland mastheads like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mercury</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Whitsunday</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Times</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Whitsunday Coast Guardian</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Bowen Independent</span> will cease print publication after this month. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tablelander</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Northern Miner</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Port Douglas &amp; Mossman Gazette</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Th</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e Burdekin Advocate</span> will disappear completely. The loss of these regional media jobs will be a devastating blow for regional communities, journalists, printers and sales staff. The natural consequence of these cuts is that regional Queenslanders will be less informed about the issues impacting their lives. Fewer reporters will be available to perform their watchdog role covering council meetings and court proceedings. Many have noted that regional papers are also a training ground for Australian journalists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, what we know is that we have great journos in regional Queensland that love to call regional Queensland home. And they do a great job writing the stories about local government decisions and shining a light on community news. Without them, many stories simply wouldn't get told. When decision-makers are less accountable to the public, this leads to poorer community outcomes. But these cuts won't just impact journalists. These regional media cuts will see the Rockhampton print centre close on 26 June and the Warwick print centre close on 17 July. Eighty-four hardworking print workers will lose their jobs; 45 of them were permanent staff. Some of these workers found out that they were going to lose their job on breakfast TV or on radio news while they were on their way to work. That is not good enough. These workers deserved better than that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how important these jobs are to regional communities and I know that these workers work hard, and have done for so many years, to get the news out. When I was young, my dad worked the night shift as a printer at Fairfax, so I know that print workers don't turn up day after day simply to do a job; they do it because they love serving their community, and getting the news out is important work. Sadly, so many regions are missing out on these vital news services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a lot from this government during this crisis about supporting manufacturing workers. But they are not supporting these manufacturing workers. We also hear a lot from the members opposite about how they represent the regions. But when it comes to regional media they have gone missing. What is the point of a Liberal-National government if they cannot save regional newspapers? They are very happy to head out there with their Akubra hats and do a press conference and make an announcement, but when they do that there will not be any regional journos there to hear them. These cuts, as we know, started a long time before the COVID-19 pandemic. The government simply cannot hide behind COVID-19 for letting these cuts unfold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor warned that the government's Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, announced in 2017, was ideologically motivated and inadequate. This government also wasted precious time in failing to provide timely and effective support for a media sector in crisis. And now we know that the minister's Public Interest News Gathering Fund, announced in the middle of this crisis, is scant on detail, inadequate and too late to save regional Queenslanders' jobs. Delays on this government's watch mean that essential funding is yet to flow to media organisations in their time of need. These jobs needed this government to step in, but they have turned their back on regional Queenslanders once again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  I rise tonight to discuss mature-age workers, a cohort of Australians I am very worried about, particularly in the midst of this crisis and recession. The data paints an unsettling and upsetting picture for anyone concerned about the wellbeing of older Australians. It shows that our older workers are having a particularly difficult time in the labour market, especially through the coronavirus crisis. For example, employment for people aged 50 years and over fell by 3.4 per cent in April this year. The number of Australians aged over 50 who are unemployed or working zero hours significantly increased in the month of April. Australians aged over 55 also spent a much longer time looking for jobs compared to the younger age groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the shortcomings of this data from the ABS is that it hides the cohorts that are specifically struggling at this time, including older Australians from CALD backgrounds, disabled people and women. Older workers face a myriad of barriers in the workplace, including ageism and discrimination. These are especially pronounced during a recession, when jobs are scarcer. We have all heard accounts from people who have been told to remove their age from their CV and to dye their hair if they want to keep their job, or have been refused training on the basis of their age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I want to express my strong concern that the government isn't considering the needs of older workers enough at this time. One of the ways we could better support older unemployed workers is by improving the job active scheme. I have spoken a lot about the job active scheme in this place. I often hear from people who have been discriminated against by their provider on the basis of their age. For example, they been told to look for volunteer roles instead of paid work. We need to embark on a process of educating employment consultants to ensure they are equipped to sensitively assist older unemployed workers. There needs to be a greater focus on career guidance and a pathway for providers to specialise in helping disadvantaged older workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Career Transition Assistance program is one way employment providers can help older workers. While I welcome the recent announcement this program now has a separate funding source, I have concerns that it is not geographically dispersed, and the referral rate to date has been incredibly low. Another way we could better support older workers would be by retaining the rate of the jobseeker payment. Before COVID, people aged over 45 years made up the largest age cohort on jobseeker and they spent the longest time out of work. Setting income support payments above the poverty line would prevent older people ageing in poverty on the aged pension. This should be coupled with the relaxed eligibility requirements around income and asset tests until the economy has recovered. We still have a lot of work to do to ensure older workers aren't left behind. Older workers were already doing it tough juggling health issues, caring responsibilities and facing discrimination in the workplace and when trying to find work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to step up and show leadership at this critical time; otherwise, a whole large cohort of older Australians who are seeking work may never find work again. Where is the recovery plan for older workers to ensure they have specialist support to help them find work and access better training? Where is the reach out to expand the Career Transition Assistance program so it is better geographically dispersed, so that more people, older Australians, can access it? While we have such a large cohort of older Australians who are being discriminated against, where ageism is playing a clear role in keeping people out of work, we cannot drop these hardworking Australians, who will want to regain work, on to $40 a day. It is unconscionable to do that to this group of Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  I rise in this adjournment debate to raise some very serious questions about the conduct of the Labor Party in Victoria and Victorian Labor Party members of parliament, not just state but federal. On <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> on Sunday night and in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> newspaper the following morning, the shocking headlines reverberated in every household in Victoria and around the nation. Labor writes notorious head kicker, Adem Somyurek, a power hungry Minister of the Crown, brought back into cabinet by Premier Daniel Andrews after being forced to resign over his treatment of a staff member, was caught red-handed on videotape boasting about how he wielded most of the power in Victorian Labor as well as branch stacking, using disgusting foul language about numerous people—including the Premier and one of his female cabinet colleagues—seemingly organising forged documents, cash payments for fake Labor Party members, with staff improperly working for his factional machine rather than for the members of parliament for whom they were hired to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has tried to give the impression that it has moved quickly to stop the rot, with the Premier referring these matters to Victoria Police and IBAC, sacking Adem Somyurek, expelling him from the party and forcing the resignation of two other cabinet ministers close to Somyurek. The national executive of the ALP has taken over the Victorian branch and a full-blown inquiry is now underway. It seems the pre-selections of all state and federal MPs in Victoria are now safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, have been incredibly slow off the mark when it comes to understanding the role of the federal member for Holt, Mr Byrne. It was Mr Byrne's federal electorate office in Cranbourne West where these covert video recordings occurred. The surveillance may be unlawful under both Victorian and Commonwealth law. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, was the only person in the nation, it seems, who didn't seem to notice the map of the electorate for Holt, a poster, the parliamentary screensaver and there was even—for viewers who watched this very closely—a photo of Mr Byrne on the bookshelf. But Mr Albanese failed to speak with Mr Byrne, let alone understand whether he had any knowledge of this surveillance. Under the Victorian Surveillance Devices Act, it is an offence for a person to knowingly install, use or maintain a listening or optical device unless it's for law enforcement purposes, in the public interest or for the protection of the lawful interests of the person making the recording. The maximum penalty is two years in jail. Mr Byrne has agreed to cooperate with police. If he has any knowledge of these covert activities in his office whatsoever, his position as deputy chair of the parliament's—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:58</span>):  Essential workers have been the heroes of COVID-19. Our health workers, our cleaners, our truckies, our retail staff and of course our aged-care workers have ensured that some of our most vulnerable citizens remain safe from the virus. I know that expectations were raised amongst aged-care workers when the government agreed to pay them a retention bonus to ensure the continuity of the workforce for aged-care workers in both residential and home care. But, sadly, as we so often see with this government, these expectations were dashed by yet another broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, having raised these expectations and for once making aged-care workers feel truly valued for their vital work, the government then excluded about 40 per cent of aged-care workers from receiving the retention bonus. Just as this government has excluded short-term casuals, arts and entertainment workers, university workers, migrant workers and others from receiving the JobKeeper payment, it decided to exclude the catering staff, cleaners, gardeners, therapy assistance and leisure and lifestyle workers at aged-care facilities, as well as aged-care workers delivering care under the Commonwealth Home Support Program. Is the government really saying that some aged-care workers aren't as important as others? Why would the government exclude 40 per cent of aged-care workers from receiving a payment meant to recognise their service?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the government promised payments of up to $800 after-tax per quarter for residential care workers and up to $600 after-tax per quarter for home care workers. But after making this announcement, the government changed the goal posts, making these payments taxable. All week we've seen the aged care minister dodge this. The fact is that the government have broken their promise. It's an absolute disgrace and disrespects aged-care workers.</span>
