         At the invitation of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) the Defence Subcommittee visited Exercise Kangaroo 92 for the period 19 to 21 March 1992. The objectives of Exercise Kangaroo 92 and the conduct of the exercise were communicated to members of the Subcommittee at an initial exercise concept briefing in Darwin. The Subcommittee was then provided with opportunities to visit Headquarters Northern Command, including the Joint Operation Centre and the land, air and maritime component operations rooms, the Special Air Service Squadron, 1 Media Support Unit and 1 Logistics Support Group.

         The Subcommittee was flown by Caribou aircraft to Timber Creek, where 2 Cavalry Regiment was deployed, and to RAAF Base Tindal to observe the activities of 1 Field Hospital Unit. At Tindal we were also briefed on the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment Parachute Battalion Group and the role of No. 75 Squadron in Exercise Kangaroo 92.

         The visit, though brief, impressed upon the Subcommittee some of the fundamental difficulties faced by the Australian Defence Force in operations in the north. Temperatures were high and conditions humid throughout our visit. I note the comments of the Chief of the Defence Force on the lessons learnt from the exercise. These include the need for Australian Defence Force personnel to be better acclimatised, although of the 12,000 troops deployed in the exercise less than one per cent were treated for heat stress. Nonetheless, during our inspection of the vehicles and equipment of 26 Transport Squadron and 30 Terminal Squadron, we were told that drivers had had to endure temperatures of up to 58 degrees Celsius in the cabins of vehicles. Conditions inside the tanks and armoured vehicles of 2 Cavalry Regiment were no more comfortable.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The nature of the terrain in which members of our Defence Force have to operate was again brought home to the Subcommittee during the visit to Timber Creek. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, the Subcommittee has recently focused its attention on the north through its inspections of northern defence units and establishments in August and October last year. Members appreciate not only the enormity of northern Australia but also the wide variety of terrain in which the Australian Defence Force will increasingly need to operate as significant elements of the Australian Defence Force are relocated to the north. Members therefore understand the difficulties encountered in moving troops and supplies in such conditions and we endorse the remarks of the Chief of the Defence Force on the need for Chinook helicopters to carry fuel and troops.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The visit to Kangaroo 92 served to make the Subcommittee aware of several limitations which had to be taken into consideration by the Australian Defence Force in the organisation of the exercise. We were told, for example, that the operations of the Logistics Support Group were affected by State regulations pertaining to the transfer of fresh food, particularly fruit and vegetables, across State boundaries.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Consideration also has to be given by the Australian Defence Force to national parks and Aboriginal sacred sites. With respect to areas in which Aboriginal sacred sited exist, the Subcommittee was told that there is no universal approach by land councils to restricting military access to such areas. Some land councils prohibit specific sites, whereas others impose a blanket prohibition.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The members of the Subcommittee welcomed the opportunities provided by their attendance at K92 to inspect equipment which is currently being procured by the Australian Defence Force. Indeed, the visit to Kangaroo 92 served to complement briefings which have been provided to the Subcommittee in other forums. For instance, members have been briefed on the Steyr rifle, and the visit to Kangaroo 92 gave members access to a variety of viewpoints on the capabilities of that weapon. We were also interested to obtain comment on the performance of the Perentie long range patrol vehicle, the Special Air Service water operations equipment and the communications systems such as Raven.

         From the viewpoint of the Subcommittee there was much to be gained from both seeing units in operational mode and speaking to Australian Defence Force personnel. The Subcommittee was made aware of concerns that low-flying intruding aircraft cannot be detected without the employment of airborne early warning and control aircraft. Again, I note the comments of the Chief of the Defence Force that the exercise demonstrated the need for airborne early warning and control aircraft to more precisely target information from surveillance systems such as the Jindalee over the horizon radar. I make a plea to the Government that the acquisition of airborne early warning and control aircraft is long overdue and has exposed a dangerous gap in the capability of the Australian Defence Force.

         At the time of our visit, 1 Field Hospital was packing up to move out of the operational area of the exercise. This gave us a good appreciation of the mobility and sophistication of medical facilities available to the Australian Defence Force on operations. We were similarly impressed by the state of the art technology used by the Media Support Unit.

         I turn now to the 5th Aviation Regiment's participation in Exercise Kangaroo 92. The exercise was the first full regiment level operation for the new unit. Therefore it was the regiment's first opportunity to demonstrate its achievements over the last four years. This regiment now provides substantial air mobility to the operational deployment force by day and by night. For example, the regiment inserted two infantry battalions on Melville Islandâ€”one at night in two large scale air mobile assaults using vision devices, which is a first for the Australian Defence Force. It then contributed to the amphibious tactical lodgment of another battalion from HMAS

         This exercise proved that a new level of air mobility now exists in the Australian Defence Force.

         I also want to acknowledge the constraints, both financial and physical, under which that exercise was carried out and under which the Australian Defence Force generally performs. I think it would be fair to say that, in performing as well and as admirably as it did in the Gulf during the Gulf conflict, had that conflict escalated and lengthened, our contribution would have been stretched to its absolute limits. I know that the right honourable member for New England has had a lot to say about this in the past and I fully support what he has had to say. The Australian Defence Force undoubtedly suffers from a large degree of stretch. It is about time that we in the political arena understood the extent to which that is happening.

         As the honourable member for Herbert has said, we still await the official wash-up of Exercise Kangaroo 92 but I think it is reasonable for us to make a few personal observations, and some that I certainly had regarding our visit, on some of the obvious equipment shortfalls and inadequacies. I completely agree with what the honourable member said about the over the horizon radar, Jindalee. It is absolutely imperative, if we are to be effective in terms of surveillance, that those AEW and C aircraft be made available as soon as possible. I say to the Government that the Jindalee project has the potential to be a disaster without those aircraft.

         â€”I rise to support the remarks made by my colleagues the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). While the US Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney, was in Australia, he observed the extent to which, with the run-down in the tensions between the super-powers,  significant changes are being made within the United States forces. He did remark, however, that a priority is still being given to the training of those forces and to the absolute need for funds to be made available to ensure that, whether it is another Gulf war-United Nations type conflict or whether it is a combat of some other order, the same capacity to coordinate and to provide a well-trained, professional, military response is retained by the Americans. Those words, to my mind, are absolutely imperative to the Australian Defence Force. It is to that end, but within a strategic concept that followed the Paul Dibb premise, that this Kangaroo 92 exercise was designed.

         It really is not a new concept. It follows a series of Kangaroo exercises that date back at least to 1983. It is a concept which involves a number of basic requirements. I share the views of my colleagues in a number of areas which I do not intend to repeat as time does not permit. There are two, however, that I specifically wish to refer to. In referring to the competence and professionalism of the members of the Australian Defence Force who participated in the exercise, I wanted in particular to identify the contribution of the Reserves, some of whom came from southern States and who, immediately on arrival, were subject to extraordinary temperatures and to work conditions that are quite outside the experience that would be permitted under any industrial arrangement.

         The conditions of operation need to be remembered by the Government. In some of the armoured vehicles, the new LAVs for example, the temperature may reach up to 55 degrees, which is absolutely unbearable. Something needs to be done to correct that.

         There is a difficulty with armoured vehicles because project Waler, originated by the coalition Government, was terminated by the Labor Party. As a result, we have an imported, Northern Hemisphere vehicle which is frankly not ideally suited to our climate or our conditions. It is a great pity Australia could not have continued to develop a vehicle specifically for its own requirements.

         The second remark made by my colleagues that I want to endorse very strongly is the need for an airborne early warning aircraft. It is understood that there were a number of incursions made without detection by the existing Jindalee. Without airborne early warning aircraft, it is quite apparent that Australia is not able to meet the parameters laid down for that exercise, or indeed for the defence of Australia. It is quite imperative that those aircraft be given a high priority.

         There are a number of other conclusions with respect to equipment; again, I have not time to identify them. But I am concerned at the extent to which the Caribou is getting towards the end of its effective service life. It has been a wonderful aircraft. I just wonder what there is to replace it. Of course, because this was not a particularly wet Wet, the exercise was not really adequately able to evaluate a number of items of equipment under the conditions which would normally apply during that part of the season. The wet season this year, as I said, lacked the monsoons that so often make conditions up north quite extraordinarily ferocious.

         In conclusion, I wish to raise two other matters. The first is in relation to future commitments of our forces in a peace-keeping role. There is a tremendous logistic capability within the Australian forces; that was demonstrated in Kangaroo 92. This capability would have a distinct advantage for Australia and I am very disappointed that nothing has been done in Cambodia in that sense.

         The second matter is that because this is the first occasion on which I have been able to speak on defence matters in this House since Lieutenant-General John Coates stepped down as the former Chief of the General Staff, I would like to pay particular tribute to him. It is a great pity that the Government gave him only two years of service. He is a remarkable man and the contribution he has made is outstanding. The CGS exercise recently demonstrated that, and of course on a personal level I would also like to extend to Major-General John Grey my congratulations. I wish him well.

         , which is in fact the result of the deliberations of the Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of which I was a member.

         Let me set the record straight for honourable members of the House. People may wish to know that this report was two years in the making; public hearings were held throughout Australia. At this Parliament House, it held four very worthwhile two-day seminars at which women and some men from all over Australia looked at four particular issues: women in sport; women and recognition; women in the work force; and the Sex Discrimination Act. So it is somewhat difficult to swallow what the Opposition has said about the process and the time frame.

         The Subcommittee, which was entrusted with the carriage of this report by that full Committee, went through this report line by line, word by word. So the kind of statements that appear in the dissenting report are at best bleatings and show a total disregard for the way in which that Subcommittee operated for two years at the behest of the total Committee.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At the centre of the issue is the whole question of the status of women within Australia, given the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act has been enacted for five years. Women still, though, are enormously invisible within our history. Very many people here in downtown Canberra give great acclaim to somebody like Burley Griffin, not recognising, in fact, that it was his wife who was the architect and who did most of the work. That is something perhaps interesting that all of us may not know. Indeed, it is just part of the general world of myths that have continued in a society which, being patriarchal and hierarchical, has failed to acknowledge the role of women in our society. Sadly, it continues to do so.

         One of the other issues that were raised by the Committee is the stereotyping of womenâ€”the way in which women are stereotyped within the media and advertisements. Of course, one of the other major media issues is sports coverage. One could well ask why games such as lawn bowls, netball and, in fact, even women's hockey, more recently, are not automatically displayed by our media. Rugby league can be televised nationallyâ€”and I have to say that I am a great supporter of rugby leagueâ€”but it is, in fact, played by a very small number of people in comparison with the number of women who play netball, hockey and so on. However, we also must give great creditâ€”and the report and the Committee doâ€”to the ABC for picking up the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Goal Attack

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As well as that, I think that the Committee recognises that no amount of legislation can change the attitudes of Australian society to women overnight. We need to create an environment in which these attitudes are shown to be what they areâ€”illegal and debilitating to the community as a whole, not just to women. All of us as a community are lessened by that.

         Indeed, one would have to question why the Opposition would oppose the placing of equal protection before the law as a provision in the Sex Discrimination Act. One has to ask what kind of a political party can possibly oppose the writing in of equal protection before the law for all of its citizens. Members of the Opposition should hang their heads in shame at opposition to such a clause. One wonders what they mean. It is absolutely frightening and terrifying to think that we have members of this House resisting and, in fact, verbally opposing the inclusion of a clause of equal protection for all our citizens before the law in the Sex Discrimination Act. We simply are overwhelmed by this, and I have to say that while attitudes such as this continue to pervade our society we as a community are very much lessened.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I also draw to the attention of the House a number of facts which show the kinds of outmoded and outdated views which the Committee found obtained throughout much of our community. As many people now know, women constitute 51 per cent of the population. So rather than being a minority issue, we are, in fact, a majority issue. Indeed, for members of this House, the gender question should be considerably more important because we are, after all, 54 per cent of the voting public. Those parties and members of parliament who fail to address the needs of women in their community do so at their own peril. One should not need to point out that sort of issue because we should all be compelled by the moral imperative that drives us all in believing that we are all equal and should all be treated equally.

         One of the other parts of the Opposition's dissenting report deals with the exemption of the defence forces. One has simply to ask: is the Opposition not aware that there are now women in the Australian forces serving in Cambodia under the UN flag and that we had women serving within the refugee camps of the Kurds?  Women have shown that, in a more technological age and because of the nature of the defence forces, equal opportunities are not based on gender but rather on merit. So if people try to turn back the clock when we already have women serving in our armed forces, one must ask where they are actually at.

         One of the other issues which we need to look at, and which are covered very definitely by the report, is the nature of the changing role of women. Indeed, the report states quite clearly that there is a whole range of work force practices which need to change because, after all, our work force is largely made up of women. More than half of those women who are married are also in the paid work force. Indeed, the image of the male as the breadwinner with a dependent spouse, usually a female, at home, represents only 19 per cent of households in Australia. So to have the kind of view shown in the Arnott's biscuits advertisement of the picket fence, with dad going off to work and mum sitting at home, is an absolute travesty and a nonsense with regard to what society is about.

         It is imperative, as this report suggests, to look at the whole range of issues which must be addressed to ensure that women are given equal status and equal opportunity. Within the workplace, it is imperative that flexible working hours, award conditions and so on take note of the changing role of women. The role of women in terms of income support, sole parents, carers, old age pensions, superannuation and the demands of women within the work force to be part of superannuation schemes is important, and is addressed in recommendations by this Committee.

         Another area in which women have played an enormous role is in the area of voluntary work. Despite the fact that many women are in the paid work force, they still do an enormous amount of voluntary work. We recommend that that be acknowledged through inclusion in the national accounts, and that is very important.

         What this report attempts to address and seeks to acknowledge is the changing role of women in our society. We have attempted to make recommendations to ensure that the structures and the structural barriers that are currently in place, which are really the heritage of a society which viewed women in a very different way, are changed so that we as a society can gain from the talents of more than half of our community. We should not as a society discriminate against individuals. Also, we as a society are enriched by including in history an acknowledgment of the contribution of women in our society. We need to ensure that everybody, irrespective of gender, will have and should have equal protection before the law in this country which embraces democracy.

         â€”I make two observations to the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), for whom I have great respect and affection. The first is that all of us commend the Subcommittee for the work that it undertook. I was not a member of the Subcommittee, although I am a member of the full Committeeâ€”the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. My criticism relates largely to the fact that the report is submitted on behalf of the full Committee. It is not submitted on behalf of the Subcommittee. I was not present at the only meeting at which the Committee considered the full report. The first occasion on which I was aware that the report was going to be considered in that form was when I received a dissenting report. I am disappointed that there was not an opportunity for the full Committee to have spent slightly more time considering what is without doubt an enormous amount of material that has been received and presented, and which certainly addresses a very important part of human relations in this nation.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The criticism that I have is that it was very difficult to make judgments on the full report when I had not read it at the time that I was called on to dissent from it.

         My second observation is that I note that, with regard to the report that has been printed, it has been necessary to insert an addendum to include the two names of those who dissent from the report. My name is one; the other is that of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). I draw attention to the fact that those corrections need to be added to the report because they were not included at the time the report was printed.

         I have a number of problems with the report. Let me start by commending not only the Subcommittee but also the secretariat for the enormous amount of work that they put into this report. My trouble is that I think we need to be very careful that we do not make an overly legislative response to such a sensitive issue. Without doubt, if there is only a legislative response we are likely to generate more difficulties for the employment of women. I do not think anybody wants that.

         Certainly, there are major problems in our community. Sexual harassment, to which the report refers, is one. I have some sympathy for the extent to which there needs to be a heightened approach to redress the problems of sexual harassment. It occurs in all sorts of ways, and it is not peculiar to women. It is a problem which seems to have been heightened in our society in recent years and it is one that certainly disadvantages those who are subject to it. That is an area that I am glad to see the report addresses.

         Several aspects of the report concern me. One of the general social problems in Australia is that we are all becoming more selfish. I think we concern ourselves too much with ourselves and not with society around us. The report, in addressing the problems of children, makes reference specifically to education for girls and child-care. However, we need to register that in trying to promote equality for adults, we need to worry about equality for children. It is for that reason that the reference to education for girls is mentioned.

         I am concerned that we are perhaps not giving enough education for parenting. We are not paying enough attention to trying to overcome the social and financial pressures on families that can lead to child abuse and child molestation. While I would accept that that is not specifically within the reference, I am concerned that in addressing child-care, women and people issues we do not forget that a family essentially consists of three parts: the man, the woman and the child. We need to ensure that in addressing any one of those parts, we bring together our recognition of the problems of each.

         In some of the terms and expressions in the report I would have liked to have seen greater reference to the child and the extent to which child-care and other facilities are addressed. We need to ensure that children are recognised as individuals, their problems are addressed and that we do more to try to ensure that they grow up as equal participants in society. I am certain that many of the difficulties that exist today for women in our community began as a result of the way in which they were treated as children and the opportunities that were available to them. It is for that reason that the report directs added encouragement for the education of girls. I am concerned that some of those social and family problems seem to ignore the difficulty of children and I think that is a pity.

         There are a number of specific recommendations with which I find it very hard to agree and for that reason I became a willing contributor to the dissenting report. Because the honourable member for Forde referred to this point, let me pick up the reference in recommendation 71 to the Defence Force legislative requirement. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Forde mentioned, that there are women serving in Cambodia and, indeed, in peacekeeping roles elsewhere around the world. I understand we have had some female police in Cyprus. We have had women in many roles in the Defence Force and I am entirely in favour of that.

         My difficulty is that there are still, nonetheless, sex-specific areas which I think cannot be ignored. In the Defence Force, they concern me. I think we need to understand the differences between some aspects of a combat situation. I believe that there are problems in accepting recommendation 71 in its present form. I think that it would impose an obligation which, as with changes that some seek in respect of homosexuality and its treatment within the defence forces, should not be legislatively imposed.

         We need to ensure that those in a command position, particularly the commanders of the respective arms of the Defence Force, have total capacity to determine where and in what way people of either sex can be employed. I mention, for example, the SAS. Many of the duties and roles performed by the SAS may not be appropriate for girls. That does not mean that girls should not be in the SAS, nor does it mean that there should not be an increase in the number of women employed in the armed forces. Seeing the contribution made by women in the services in recent years, one can only be impressed by the manner, bearing and capacity they demonstrate. I am concerned that, in the field of these armed forces, we have to keep things in balance.

         A number of legislative requirements are being suggested. I am quite concerned to see that, in trying to provide equality for women, industrial change and legal change not discriminate against men. I guess that all honourable members, from time to time, have found occasions where discrimination is not gender specific. It certainly has been that way in the family law legislation, where there have been just as many problems for husbands as there have been for women in other families. In trying to ensure equality, we need to address that, and not try to elevate the role or status of one sex over the other. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that at the moment women are still disadvantaged in a large number of areas. It is for that reason that I thought the reference in the first place was essential.

         I am delighted that so much has been done to highlight advances achieved. Of course, in highlighting advances, it has also been essential to highlight areas where changes still need to be made. There are worries about the overemphasis on legislative change; change which I do not think achieves the sort of equality we all believe in. If something is required to be done by legislation I am sure that, in many instances, the result disadvantages rather than advantages those affected. It is for that reason that I support the reservations that have been made in the dissenting report.

         I agree with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he, too, says that. But I strongly disagree with him and the other dissenters who say that there was not time for those not on the Subcommittee to contribute. It is interesting that the two speakers this morningâ€”the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews)â€”were not on the Subcommittee, but made contributions as members of the full Committee, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They were, of course, able to make contributions through their Subcommittee colleagues at any time. That is the usual procedure.

In fact, I wish I were speaking after the honourable member for Menzies. Having attended that last meeting, I would be very happy to rebut some of the things that may be said.

         I will take up a couple of the things that the right honourable member for New England said. He spoke, for instance, of the danger of over-legislation and then the danger of only legislation, that is, depending only on legislation to change attitudes. Of course, these were the old arguments raised when we brought up legislation originally to prevent discrimination against women in Australia. We are not talking about over-legislation, nor about only legislation, to get rid of some of the discriminations suffered by half of society. We are talking about the need for legislation as a very substantial mechanism in helping to change those attitudes, and the need for legislation as a support for those changes in society.

         The right honourable member for New England talked, too, about how society is becoming more selfish. I remind the right honourable member for New England that men have always been selfish. Men have always been selfish enough to do whatever they liked, with a career, a marriage and a family. Men have always depended upon a wife and family supporting them while they get on with what they want and need to do. Men have always been selfish. Perhaps, if women are thinking of themselves a little more, it is about time.

He has come a very great way indeed. He has deep concerns about women doing some things in the Defence Force area. I remind the right honourable member for New England that women can do anything, but the fact is that men do not want women to do some things, and women are not allowed to do some things.

         I want to comment very briefly on a couple of very good things in the report. It notes that women in parliaments are few in number. Women have been in politics in Australia for over 100 years. They have had the vote for nearly 100 years. So they have been in politics by virtue of having a voteâ€”and they usually cast it very wisely and in a very informed way. Women have been involved in political activism and activity in Australia for decades. It was the women who, through the strikes, kept the mining villages going. It was the women who helped lead the struggles, such as the shearers strikes and so on. It was the women who gave stability to the society that was taking on the political struggles. Women have always been involved in those but, of course, usually in a volunteer capacity.

         The real problem for women in Australia is that we are such magnificent volunteers. The family is the perfect example of that. Let me give you some examples of women actually getting into the parliaments in Australia, remembering that the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Crawford) has told us that we are 51 per cent of the population, and that parliaments will not be representative unless we are there in those numbers; in other words, half the numbers. I make the point that the only reason women should be in the parliaments in those numbers is that the current proportion is not representative of half the population. It has got nothing to do with the fact that women are able to do a dozen things at once, are better managers, have more commonsense, are more emotionally stable and stronger. Above all, it is a natural thing for us to take responsibility for others, which makes us perfect in parliament. We are perfectly qualified. That is not the only reason why we should be here. The main reason is that women are half of the population, and parliaments will not be representative until we are here in those numbers.

         Since Federation, 16 women have sat in the House of Representatives. Ten of us are here now. Since Federationâ€”that is, in 91 yearsâ€”there have been 16 women representatives, and there are 10 of us now. The rate of change, the accelerating rate of our getting into the parliaments, is very encouraging indeed, but the history has been appalling. There are now 19 women in the Senate. Since Federation there have been 34 women in the Senate. We are terribly proud that there are 10 of us now in the House of Representatives. It is a thing that makes us feel good. We gain a great deal of strength from each other. The male members certainly take fright when they see us assembled together. They always wonder what the sheilas are up to when they see us together, because together we are a formidable force. But we number 10 out of 148 members in the House of Representatives. We have got a long way to go in taking our place in the Parliament. This report certainly refers to that and comes up with many recommendations about how to get more women into the Parliament.

         An interesting comment was made by Maxine McKew in evidence to the Committee. The report notes that she cited the fall of several women politicians who had incurred the wrath of the male dominated party hierarchies. I cannot imagine who she was thinking of, but she did note that `while women were in a minority in the Parliament, they had made some significant achievements. The great success, she said, has been in policy. Issues that used to be thought of as exclusively feminist are now regarded as economic ones, child-care being the best example'.

In that recommendation we ask for the removal of the anomaly which still prevents ex-servicewoman who did not go overseas from getting war service loans, which ex-servicemen who did not go overseas but who were willing to go overseas could get. The fact is that those servicewomen at that time were not allowed to go overseas. They were prevented from going overseas no matter how willing they were to go. We had evidence given to us by Mrs June Stone, an ex-servicewoman, who has been leading the fight in this area for a long time. I have previously recommended her work in this Parliament. She achieved the removal of the anomaly which prevented the dependants of ex-servicewomen who went overseas from getting war service loans. At least we fixed that one up.

         Society has changed fundamentally, with the proportion of women in the work force now being 52 per cent. Yet the structures that are in place in industry are geared towards the traditional concept of women at home and men at work. For all we talk about bureaucratic reviews of this and that, change is likely to be slow and evolutionary, much slower than we would like or good for the situation of women, who carry such a heavy burden trying to combine career and work.

         This report, in the section on women in relation to leisure and sport, which was raised by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), has much to say about women's participation in sport but virtually nothing about leisure. I suggest that women's participation in sport is purely peripheral and is really part of the vexed area of women's lack of time for leisure, which is not considered in the report. A recent paper by Michael Bittman found that women do 70 per cent of `hidden' labourâ€”that is, unpaid labour. I quote from his report:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Generally labour economists have presumed that the supply of paid labour is the result of a trade-off between the money that can be earned while working and the leisure time forgone in order to do so . . . Economists assume that the result of doing less paid work is increased time available for leisure. The diaries show such as trade-off for men. Free time or leisure time can be used to predict the amount of time men spend in paid work with a high degree of statistical confidence . . . Moreover, the trade-off is, as expected, one for one. For every hour more leisure one hour less paid work. However the same relationship between paid work and leisure does not hold for women . . . as women increase their paid work their unpaid work does not reduce in equal amount and therefore their total work time (paid and unpaid) increases. By contrast the relationship between paid and unpaid worktime among men is weak.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bittman goes on to say that it is usually reasoned that men specialise in paid work to maximise the family economic return, while their wives specialise in unpaid domestic work. But on examination of the 48-hour diaries used in the survey the conclusion is that, no matter how many hours of paid work their wives did, men worked 18.5 hours per week of unpaid work. Therefore, unpaid work falls disproportionately to women. Men do not carry their weight work-wise in the home. One cannot avoid the conclusion that they actually make a lot more work for women, and more than 50 per cent of them are working outside the home.

         Single mothers actually spend less time in unpaid domestic activities than any category of women with partners. They spend less time cooking, cleaning and doing laundry than even married women without children. Even on retirement, married men spend 90 per cent of their time in leisure pursuits, while amongst retired women 47 per cent of the time released by the cessation of paid work is swallowed up by extra unpaid work. Looking across the work of women throughout the world, it seems that often women are regarded as the drudges of the world. As to putting the value of unpaid work into a supplement to the national accounts figures, this will change absolutely nothing at all.

         The essential problem for women is that they lack economic power.

         For an increasing number of women there is no choice about staying at home, and that has become increasingly so in the last decade.

         Women work fewer hours or just top up the family income. Increasingly it has become the situation that women are being forced, not so much through economic desire as through economic necessity, to go out to work to ensure an adequate family income. It all adds up to no or little economic power, which is all too obvious in old age or in divorce. Is it really right, then, to make women carry the can in regard to the family?  We need a massive shake-up in the way we regard work and the way we work. We need more flexibility of working hours and less role stereotyping. This is an area in which it is doubtful whether legislation can achieve anything. A massive attitudinal change is required, especially on the part of men.

         Pornography, for example, is a serious problem in respect of the way women are depicted, but it receives no consideration in this report. It has nothing to do with being a wowser about looking at naked human bodies, but it is truly astounding that we somehow think that it is all right to see women shown as somehow less than human. We have seen the most recent episode of the soft-porn magazine that is sold in newsagents alongside children's cartoon comics and showing a woman with a diamond-studded dog collar on a leash. And this is relatively mild. The issue of women in advertising, which this Government prefers to focus on, is not nearly as significant but much safer to tackle. Government policy continues to enshrine some of the chauvinistic outdated attitudes to women, as this report has noted with regard to the differing entitlements of female and male war veterans.

         We continue to fail to adequately support the familyâ€”by which I do not mean mum, dad and the kids necessarily. The family as a term should be embraced in the broader context of all families. There is a means to do this through the taxation system. While we recognise the family as a basic unit of societyâ€”and I include `family' in various formsâ€”we have a tax system which is actually based on the individual. Governments attempt to accommodate the reality of the family by a series of concessions such as the dependent spouse rebate and family allowances.

         A more equitable system to all families, including the increasing number of women raising dependent children alone, might involve the recognition of the family as a basic unit for taxation purposes with concessions for the individualsâ€”a complete reversal of the current system. These issues were only touched upon by the Committee, but they deserve greater recognition and consideration by the community, considering especially that the National Agenda for Women stated that women should have a real choice about the form of work which they undertake.

         A related issue of volunteer work is raised in the report. An Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 1988 found that almost 25 per cent of the population aged 15 and over undertook some form of community work. It has been estimated that the value to the nation of voluntary services is some $5 billion a year. A Canadian survey estimated the value of volunteer work in that country in 1990 as $13.2 billionâ€”an imputed wage bill equivalent to 53 per cent of the total wage bill of the retail industry in Canada.

         While the Committee's recommendations concentrate on the economic aspects of volunteer work, we are reminded that many services that governments are tempted to provide can often be provided through the community itself without further burgeoning of bureaucracy. To reduce the status of volunteers to a question of monetary reward would negate the very motivation of many Australians who voluntarily provide their time and services to the community.

         As Penny Kane recently pointed out in an issues paper on women's health, the women are more likely to live alone, both because they have outlived a husband and because it seems that elderly men are considered the responsibility of their families. These old women have higher rates of musculo-skeletal problems and of accidents. Although they are less likely to be hospitalised than men, once they are hospitalised their stay is longer.

         It is often said in this country that we have an ageing population which is a problem for Australia. Like many popular beliefs, this is partly true and partly misleading; nonetheless, the belief persists. Academics and others often refer to our aged dependency crisis. The alarmist predictions that our population has reached a situation where we are not able to sustain our existence if it continues to growâ€”a claim that seems to ignore the fact that we are not even maintaining a replacement fertility rate and the current level of immigration would only produce a population of perhaps 25 million people in another 25 to 30 yearsâ€”ignore the fact that the quality of life of all Australians, young and old included, depends in large measure on the choices we make as a nation about both the creation and the distribution of wealth.

         It is true that Australia's population has aged; the contrary could not be expected. But we do remain a young nation. Even by the year 2005, when it is expected that some 12 per cent of our population will be aged 65 years or more, the age of our population will trail behind 25 other developed and industrialised countries. Hence the popular question, `How can a smaller and smaller work force support a larger and larger retired population?', overlooks the fact that the proportion of the population in the work force is expected to increase in the next two decades.

         As we point out in the report, changes in work force participation are the consequences not of demographic changes but of economic and social factors. Some of the real issues were indicated by Dr Donald Edgar, the Director of the Institute of Family Studies, during a seminar conducted by the Long Term Strategies Committee. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What Australia does face, however, is a system riddled with outmoded structures, outmoded work regulations, outmoded retirement and superannuation provisions, inadequate community-based family support, and a media archaic in its social understanding, stuck in the cult of youth and pushing an image of `the aged' that denies their status as elders where resources can and should be drawn upon.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of these issues have been addressed by the Committee. The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth Government abolish compulsory age related retirement in the Australian Public Service and other Commonwealth employment areas and that the Minister for Industrial Relations review industrial relations Acts, awards and other relevant instruments to identify and remove provisions which could discriminate on the basis of age or which make it difficult to introduce more flexible working arrangements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Similarly, we recommended an investigation of the possibilities for phased retirement and other methods of making employment at later ages more flexible. There is little doubt that more flexible work practices must become the norm in Australia if we are to be competitive in the world marketplace. While the refusal of some, including the trade union movement, to consider youth wages, for example, condemns many more young people to unemployment, the inflexibility of our retirement policies equally treats as dispensable the considerable talents, experience and abilities of older Australians. Many older people will be happy to retire from their toil. Others will continue to seek dignity in a continuing interest in their work. As Dr John McCallum said in evidence to the Committee:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Probably around a third of all retirees who are able to work would prefer to work longer. The rush to retire during the 1980s has either been more of a `push', or the retirement experience has not met the expectations held about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although there are major barriers to the re-employment of older Australians who lost their jobs as a consequence of the current recession, a major long term impediment remains our attitudes to compulsory retirement and work practices.

         As McDonald's in America discovered with its McMasters program, a scheme to employ older people, there are many who will relish the new challenges in older age. Faced with a diminishing pool of younger workers, McDonald's encouraged older people to apply at their neighbourhood McDonald's for jobs, which the company's blurb said:

       </para>
       <para>
        It produced a national television commercial called `The New Kid'. These new kids were aged over 65 years. The McDonald's program may not appeal to all, but it does point to the opportunities for more flexible working arrangements and, more importantly, a review of our attitudes to the elderly. As Pablo Picasso once remarked:

Australia was isolated and geographically remote from Britain and the United States. The Japanese Prime Minister, Tojo, warned Australia that resistance against Japan's armed might was useless.

        The Battle of the Coral Sea was a remarkable naval battle, and a turning point in the war. It was fought entirely by air power, with neither side coming close enough to visually assess the enemy or sight and fire their naval guns. It was a lesson from which the admirals, officers and naval personnel were able to learn in great detail and use to great effect in their magnificent victory at the Battle of Midway. It was a victory for Allied cooperation, because Australian forcesâ€”the two cruisers in Rear Admiral Crace's squadron, an Australian-born Royal Navy officerâ€”had played their part in this action. It was also a grim reminder of the capacity of the Japanese military forces at the time and of their determination to pursue their militaristic ambitions to the fullest. It enabled Australia to gain a respite, to build up morale and to join with its American comrades in arms in the eventual defeat of the Empire of Japan.

        Fifty years have now passed and celebrations are being held Australia-wide to commemorate the Battle of the Coral Sea. In Townsville, in particular, this week a memorial will be unveiled to commemorate the gallant sailors and airmen who gave their lives in the defence of Australia. This motion is a significant motion for Australia, and I commend it to the House.

        Fifty years ago most Australians were expecting and preparing for invasion by the Japanese. We were in a perilous situation. The war in the Pacific was not going well, the enemy was on our northern doorstep, and an attack on the Australian mainland seemed inevitable. Although I was quite young, and my memories of this period of crisis and uncertainty are, therefore, generally rather vague, I do recall quite clearly the feelings of apprehension which existed in my home, in the homes of friends and, indeed, throughout the whole community at that time. I also remember the relief that was so apparent when the news of the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea and, shortly after, the Battle of Midway came through. At last the Japanese advance had been halted. They were not, as many had thought, invincible. Coral Sea and Midway proved that they could be stopped.

        The Battle of the Coral Sea was fought off the south-eastern tip of New Guinea on 7 and 8 May 1942. It was an historic and notable battle. Apart from the fact that it marked the first setback suffered by Japanese forces, it was also the first time that a naval battle was resolved without the surface elements of the fleet sighting each other. It is now generally accepted that the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea was inconclusive in many respects. The closeness of the encounter can be seen from the battle statistics. The Japanese lost the 12,000-ton light carrier

        I say this because it has become very popular to ridicule and belittle the genuineness of American motives in the international arena and to equate cooperation and friendship with the US with subservience and second-class status.

        Regretfully, such strident anti-Americanism does not exclusively belong in the domain of Third World dictatorships, but has support in some quarters in democracies such as Australia. Without doubt, the US is not perfect. It has made some foreign policy decisions over the years which I believe have been fundamentally wrong. Also, to my way of thinking, it has not always been overly tactful or understanding in its dealings with its friends. However, it should be remembered that such criticisms can be made of every state, including Australia.

        History shows that the United States made a full commitment to the defence of Australiaâ€”a commitment which led to the loss of thousands of US lives in ferocious engagements such as the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway.

        Historians tell us that the Coral Sea Battle turned the tide against the Japanese; it was the first occasion that their southward thrust had been repulsed. It laid the foundation for the later Battle of Midway which finally put paid to Japan's claim to maritime supremacy in the southern Pacific. In the sense that the Coral Sea Battle represented a turning point in the repulsion of an aggressor and exemplified the spirit of cooperation which is now part and parcel of the Australian-American relationship, it is fitting that the fiftieth anniversary of this event should be used as the basis for a motion before this House.

        Before 1942, Australia's relationship with the United States was not quite as glittering as I think some people might imagine it to have been, because all of us have grown up with an enormously close relationship with the United States. But prior to 1942, that really was not quite the case. Great celebrations were held in 1908 at the time of the visit of the Great White Fleet. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his speech welcoming Defense Secretary Cheney, referred to that visit of the Great White Fleet. It was an important event in Australia in the first decade of this century.

        But following that visit there were some reservations in Australia about the United States. There was a degree of resentment that the United States entered the First World War as late as it did in 1917. There was a view in

       Australia amongst many that the Americans had to carry the bulk of responsibility for the Great Depression. At around that time, a great deal of antipathy between Australia and the United States developed over trade relations. Indeed, many members would not know that Australia lost its most favoured nation trading status with the United States in the late 1920s or early 1930s as a result of tensions over trade issues.

        It really was not until the Second World War that this uneasy, although friendly, relationship with the United States became a great bond between two nations. As others have pointed out, that came about following the retreat down the Malay Peninsula, the fall of Malaya and, finally, the fall of Singaporeâ€”events which my own father participated in.

        Naturally, these events created enormous anxiety in the Australian community. It was really a wonderful thing for this country that, a few months later, the Battle of the Coral Sea not only took place, but also that it was such a great, at least strategically, success. I think that, as a tactical battle, the Japanese came out of it slightly better than the Allies did. But as a strategic battle it was an absolutely pivotal moment in the Second World War. It stopped the Japanese advance to the south and the west. It effectively stopped the Japanese from taking Port Moresby and possibly moving on from complete control of what is now Papua New Guinea, to invade Australia itself. History will never record and we will never know whether the Japanese had, in fact, ever intended to do that. Nevertheless, it was understandably a great cause of anxiety in Australia at the time that Australia would be their next target.

        The Battle of the Coral Sea stopped that advance to the south and the west by the Japanese. It did more than that. It ensured that Australia was not cut off from its alliesâ€”in particular, from its principal ally, the United States. Had the Battle of the Coral Sea not succeededâ€”or had it not even taken placeâ€”and had the Japanese taken the whole of New Guinea, not only would Australia have been in danger of invasion from the Japanese but also it would also have been completely isolated from its allies in terms of communications, equipment and so on.

        This, therefore, was an absolute watershed in Australian foreign policy and defence history. That is why I am very glad that this motion has been moved, that the Parliament has focused its mind on this issue and that there have been such celebrations during the last few days to commemorate the battle. The legacy of the Battle of the Coral Sea, the legacy of that first great, practical step in the Australia-United States defence relationship, is still very much with us. I think one could say that the Battle of the Coral Sea was, in a sense, the grandfather of the ANZUS alliance. The ANZUS alliance, which was signed by the Menzies Government, has been the basis of Australian defence policy from that time until today.

        The ANZUS alliance has been more, though, than just the basis of our defence policy. It has been one of the alliances, one of the arrangements, that have turned the Pacific into a virtual zone of exclusion during the Cold War. It has allowed the Pacific as a region to evolve economically. It has ensured that countries in South-East Asia and also in North-East Asia have been able to achieve very substantial rates of economic growth and overall prosperity. It has also ensured that we have been free from some of the worst excesses of the Cold War which have had such an appalling impact on the psychology of, in particular, Europe.

        ANZUS, despite the end of the Cold War, is still very much one of the pillars of our defence policy. I was very glad on Monday, during my discussions with Defense Secretary Cheney, that he reiterated the United States view that it remains very strongly committed to the alliance with Australiaâ€”and, indeed, more than that, very strongly committed to continuing to be actively involved in our region. Nevertheless, as I pointed out to Secretary Cheney, and as he certainly agreed, there are still great regional security issues which remain. The ANZUS alliance is still, therefore, of very great importance to us, despite the end of the Cold War.

        We need to keep building the ANZUS alliance. We should not just take it for granted. We need to look at areas where we can make our contribution to the alliance. That is one of the reasons that the joint facilities are so important. We need to look at it in terms of a way of ensuring equipment acquisition. Clearly, a very important part of the alliance is the process of joint exercises and training. We need to play our part in terms of continuing the policy of allowing ship visits from the United Statesâ€”something which has excluded New Zealand from the ANZUS alliance because it does not allow such visits. We need, in areas where we possibly can, to upgrade the alliance by, for example, allowing the United Statesâ€”should a commercial arrangement be reachedâ€”to use the Delamere air combat manoeuvre range, the so-called bombing range near Tindal. As I said to Secretary Cheney the other day, we should try to get the Americans interested in using Australian bases for repairs and maintenance for the United States Navy.

        In the years ahead the ANZUS alliance will, I believe, remain strategically significant both to Australia and to the United States. I do not think we should ever take for granted the stability of our region. Of course, in present circumstances we can see no immediate threat to the stability of our near region, but changes can take place, and take place very suddenly. It always concerns me to hear people say that there can be no perceived threat to Australia for 10 years or 15 years. We just do not know what political events could take place in countries relatively near or very near to Australia. So ANZUS remains an enormously important backstop to Australia. It gives us a status in a defence sense that we otherwise would not have. As I said earlier, it gives the United States some opportunities in the region as well, which we need to continue to encourage.

        â€”I am very pleased to take part in the debate on this bipartisan motion that is before the House today. I would like to pay tribute to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for moving this motion. As fellow Queenslanders, the Battle of the Coral Sea is of even greater significance to us than to people from other States because north Queensland was very close to the action in the Coral Sea and, of course, to the threat of invasion. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said, there was a very real threat of invasion. That invasion would have occurred in Queenslandâ€”in northern Queensland in particular. It is a fact that allied personnel were based in north Queensland and played a pivotal role in helping to destroy the Japanese invasion which was centred on capturing Port Moresby. The text of the motion deserves to be read in full. It states:

        It is also important to pay tribute to two great and outstanding American service personnel, Nimitz and Halsey, who played a massive role under Admiral King, who, as I understand it, was Supreme Commander of Naval Forces in the Pacific.

        It is of such fundamental importance, as I have said, to Queenslanders because at the time of the Battle of the Coral Sea a cane farm could be sold for 2/6 an acre and many families left the north because of the fear of invasion. I would like to place on record the fact that my father-in-law, who is now deceased, travelled to Charters Towers and worked with his family on putting down the airstrips so that the US and Australian forces could utilise Charters Towers as one of the major bases from which they inflicted so much effective damage against the Japanese fleet.

It is important that a nation of such importance and standing as the United States continue to pay an active role in the Pacific, and certainly we should also play an active role.

        It then centred on Admiral King tightening the naval grip on Japan and, of course, on the hard yakka done by the RAAF, along with the air forces of both countries and the Navy and land forces. They then had to take on the Japanese at places like Sanananda and Buna, Scarlet Beach, Kokoda, and then later Balikpapan and Tarakan; that is not to mention the battles further up on the islands which the United States navy and army participated in. Those battles were in places like Saipan and the like, and ultimately concluded when Japan surrendered after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That bombing was effective, but it was actually the naval blockade that ultimately sealed the fate of the Japanese.

        The US help seemed slow in coming, largely because of the great damage that was inflicted on American power at Pearl Harbour in December 1941. But in the Coral Sea, Australian and American forces joined together. In this battle there was the first halting of the Japanese drive to the south. It was followed a month later by the Battle of Midwayâ€”a battle in some ways more familiar than that of the Coral Sea because of the celebrated films made; a battle in which Japan lost four of its original 10 carriers, against the sinking of one US carrier, the

        The southern thrust did not end there. As a Sydneysider I recall the midget submarine attack on Sydney. In July the Japanese landed on the north coast of Papua New Guinea and the Kokoda Trail campaign was launched. That was halted at Amita Ridge, and then followed the difficult and costly fight back over the trail. In the month before, Japan suffered a decisive land defeat by Australian troops and RAAF aircraft at Milne Bay.

        â€”Previous speakers have described the devastating Coral Sea Battle and how attack and destruction led to a positive awakening in both Australia and the United States. As the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) said in moving this important motion, Tojo's forces brought peril to the relaxed lives of people of Australia and the United States. Both countries reacted with determination to the ferocious attack from Japan. World War II will, I hope, be the last world war, for it may be the last war in which the best of knowledge and equipment can be used, yet still leaving a world which can gain positively and learn lessons from war. The positives from a war could never outweigh the negatives, but they have been there. I would like to make brief mention of the positive effects on Australia, the United States and Japan of that disturbing encounter.

        I was a boy of five having a dinkâ€”I learnt the other day that that word is an Australian wordâ€”with my father on his bike from to Warragul to Darnum. Dad told me that we were at war. Later, he served briefly in the 6th Field Ambulance and, 17 years later, I served briefly in the same unit. Later in the war, we had visits from the United States forces. I can recall being wakened by noise and laughter in our kitchen. I went out to find my cousinsâ€”two young womenâ€”with a sailor. `Who is that?', I asked. `He is the wreck', one of them said, and they all laughed. The fact is that his name was impossible to pronounce at that time of Australia's history. We could pronounce it now quite readily, as we have people from all over the world in many of our electorates.

        The extraordinary nation of Japan also grew in so many ways, and for them, defeatâ€”the turnaround which followed the Battle of Coral Seaâ€”brought great opportunities. Unlike the United States and Australia, Japan could not spend millions, escalating to billions, of dollars in value on defence. That gave Japan an advantage, but, more importantly, contributed to Japan's greatness today. Japan kept the only redeeming feature of fascismâ€”the coordination and planning of private industry. It kept to its work ethic and it used in a better way what it had learnt from non-Japanese teachers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

        â€”In joining in the debate on this motion I thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for moving it. I join in the debate for two reasons. The first is to speak on behalf of my electorate of Dawson, from where much of the Coral Sea Battle emanated, and where many older residents remember not only World War II and what it meant as far as north Queensland was concerned but also particularly the Coral Sea Battle. The second is that I am one who remembers the occasion. I was living in the area at that time, and can fondly recall the Americans, what they did when they were on recreation leave and the manner in which they were treated by north Queenslanders. One has to remember that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Americans for what was achieved in protecting northern Australia and, in protecting northern Australia, all of Australia.

        The debt is all the more real because it was General MacArthur who did not abandon northern Australia like the Government of the day was prepared to do. The Brisbane Line lives very much in the minds of those people who lived and worked and saw the war from that perspective, when in actual fact the Government of the day was prepared to abandon Australia from the Brisbane Line north and also Western Australia.

        We must pay that debt of gratitude to General MacArthur and then particularly to those Americans, Australians and all the other nationalities who came and fought from there. In fact, there are some suggestions that even 50 years afterwards there is still a Brisbane Line mentality drawn by southern Australia with regard to where we believeâ€”and I am pretty sure that I can enjoin the honourable member for Herbert in thisâ€”the greatest opportunities for the future of Australia lie, that is, in Western Australia and northern Australia, which are what the Battle of the Coral Sea was all about.

        I was old enough to remember the Americans who used to come to Mackay as a base for rest and recreation. I remember, with my father and mother, taking these Americans for a weekend and showing them the sights and then sending them back to the Coral Sea. I can remember at that stage that there was an aircraftâ€”in fact, it was until just a few years ago the largest military aircraft disaster in the annals of world historyâ€”which crashed just outside Mackay while leaving with people after their rest and recreation. We are now erecting a memorial to those people.

        There are other things. In the practice where I first workedâ€”at G.E. Jones &amp; Co.

They came to know Eleanor Roosevelt very well and to respect her greatly. My own wife lived just across from the station and she can recall the troop trains coming in and the manner in which these American and Australian servicemen so generously looked after and gave to the youngsters of that city. Never fearâ€”we do have that debt and we do have a great memory of it.

        The other reason is that, in spite of what the honourable member for Herbert might say about the Battle of the Coral Sea coming out of Townsvilleâ€”I acknowledge that as a centre for the attack on New Guinea eventuallyâ€”Cid Harbour on the Whitsunday Island in the Whitsunday Passage was actually the collecting place for the battle fleet before it went to the Coral Sea Battle. My understanding is that it was joined there by Australian ships. One of them was the HMAS
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        , so this coming together was actually out of the Dawson electorate at Cid Harbour. As one goes around those centres now, it is great to see what changes there have been.

        On the morning of 7 May 1942, the commander of the combined force to defend the Coral Sea and head off the expected Japanese assault, Rear Admiral Fletcher, exercised his initiative to respond to the current situation by splitting his force, Task Force 17. He hived off the support group led by Rear Admiral Crace in order for them to intercept the invasion force as it exited from Jomard Passage. The problem for Crace was that his ships were thereby exposed to the possibility of an air attack without them having any fighter protection.

While I represent in this place the Australian people, nonetheless my heritage came from the United States. I remember well, as a child in 1942, listening to the radio and hearing reports of the war, particularly reports from the Pacific, as the battles unfolded. I recall studying in school the maps of the progress of war and I recall thinking how horrible it must have been for those men and those women caught on those battleships, facing enemy fire, and dying for a cause in which they so rightly and so justly believed. I felt very strongly, even at that early age, that war must surely be the last resort, that we must learn as human beings on this planet to resolve our differences in places like this House of Representatives where we can debate issues, discuss issues, where we can disagree, and where we can resolve our differences without war.

        The eventual end of the war did not produce an orgy of revenge, despite the brief and lightly dealt purges of 1945-47. Instead, Australian and American occupying forces set about creating an order based on liberal and representative government in East Asia. This was good strategy and good philosophy.

        After 1945 the Australian and American victors jointly pursued a post-colonial, open, free and democratic Asia-Pacific region. In hindsight, with full hindsight vision, the pursuit of this goal justly deserves the tribute that it receives in this motion. By the 1990s the region over which Japan had sought dominion justly claims to be the fastest growing in the world economy. Its rate of growth, of technological innovation and of political advance has been on the whole nothing short of miraculous. Much of this has, of course, been due to the energy of the people who live in the region. But some credit must also be attributed to the foresight of the victorious American and Australian allies and their determination to create and defend an open and liberal regional order, to the determined defence of the sea lanes on which its trade has been based, and to their support for liberal political values and regimes.

        This strategic mission has not been without false moves. The handling of the nascent Chinese revolutionary regime must rank as a 20-year-long miscalculation. The too ready adoption of the military option in Vietnam still extracts a price today. Burma was ignored for far too long and the Philippines dictatorship was humoured too readily. The blemishes of regional conflicts, of outbreaks of repression and continuing poverty cannot be denied, and the record of a racist and often paranoid component to Australia's Asian diplomacy in the 1950s and 1960s is very hard to deny. But in the half-century sweep since the Battle of the Coral Sea, the project which began then of cooperation between our two great countries, that was then constructed in the early 1950s and pursued resolutely to this day, must rank as a geo-strategic success.

        â€”On 9 May 1990, I pointed out to this House that we were then just two years away from the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. I paid tribute at that time to the courage of the Australians and Britishâ€”but particularly the Americansâ€”who so gallantly and ably defended Australia in the Battle of the Coral Sea. For all my life, I have been aware of this critical World War II battle and its significance to Australia.

        I was born in Brisbane on 8 March 1942, exactly two months earlier. Some of my few memories from my earliest childhood are of American servicemen. One million of them passed through Brisbane during the war and my parents, like many Brisbanites, befriended a number of these young men and did their best to give them a `home away from home' whenever they took respite in Brisbane from the war in the Pacific.

        My earliest consciousness that there was a world outside my suburb was overheard adult conversation about the Brisbane Line, that infamous line drawn from east to west through the body of the Australian continent starting at Brisbane, north of which Australia was considered undefendable. At least, that was the view of our political and military masters of the time, all of whom were at least 600 miles south of the line.

        Throughout my life I have therefore understood the particular emotions stirred in my parents' generation by the so-called threat from the north. I can understand the horror with which my parents, like so many other Australians in those darkest days, helplessly watched the apparently unstoppable advance of the Japanese armed forces as they conquered Malaya and Singapore, Indonesia, the Solomons and northern New Guinea, culminating in their victory in the Philippines in the battle for Corregidor on 6 May 1942. Mention of the Brisbane Line froze their hearts and minds as they waited in dread for what lay ahead for them and their children. In the light of this, it is surely possible, even 50 years hence, to understand the impact on average Australians in 1942 of the news of the first ever success in stopping the Japanese advance, namely, the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 and 8 May.

        In the very few minutes available to me today, I want to pay tribute to all those who have worked to keep to the fore the significance of the Battle of the Coral Sea over the intervening decades. It is all very well to remember an occasion when the fiftieth anniversary occurs. In my view, those who have sought the limelight this yearâ€”when everyone is lookingâ€”are not those to whom honour is due today: that honour goes to many nameless people who have faithfully observed the occasion and steadfastly paid tribute to its significance year by year since 8 May 1942. I truly doubt that there would have been a comparable celebration of this event had they not `kept the faith' through the intervening decades, often in the face of indifference, sometimes outright hostility.

        The first public commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea was initiated in 1946 by the Victorian Division of the Australian-American Association, an organisation formed in Sydney in 1936. The first Annual Coral Sea Ball was also held in 1946 in Sydney. These events were the genesis of what became known throughout Australia as Coral Sea Week, and they continue to this day. Ever since 1946 the Battle of the Coral Sea has been observed annually at public ceremonies in all our capital citiesâ€”Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbaneâ€”as well as Wagga, Launceston, the Gold Coast and, in more recent years, Cairns and Townsville.

At one of the 1986 Coral Sea ceremonies, Admiral `Ace' Lyons unveiled a plaque on the memorial wall outside the Southport RSL, which had been donated by retired US servicemen who now live on the Gold Coast.

        My consciousness, and that of many honourable members in this House, was formed in the post-1945 world. It was formed by my family and my friends who told me, as a child, of their experiences in the war. It became very clear to me, and I am sure to those who went through the process, that the Battle of the Coral Sea was really the turning point in terms of the marine based Japanese offensive against targets to the south, including Australia. It was also clear to me that, if it had not been for the role of the United States, Australia would have been in an extremely precarious position. They were very dark days. They were days in which Australia's resources were stretched and in which our capacity to conduct military engagements of this kind was completely beyond the resources we could commit. But for the support of the United States Australia would have been in a very bad position indeed.

        I believe it was from the experience of that battle that Australia began to realise that it was a regional player. If one looks at the experience since World War II, Australia had to begin to understand its role and to work out its relationship in the region, and also to understand that the United States was to be a key player in the region. I say many times to young people at schools that it was the experience in the Coral Sea that really became a major underpinning of Australia's postwar foreign policy. It was an underpinning based on the fact that we had survived in what were very precarious circumstances.

        It had many interesting characteristics. It was significant because it was one of those major naval battles in which aircraft carriers played a prominent role. It also, therefore, made Australians think about the role of aircraft carriers in relation to war and our commitment. It is interesting that Australia no longer has an aircraft carrier capacity. That is because we now realise that land based capacity is significant in terms of the engagements that we might anticipate.

        I want to reflect on the fact that the Battle of the Coral Sea was not only a turning point in the war and of such tremendous importance to Australiaâ€”the significance at the time and the atmosphere of 1942 are difficult for us to recall now, 50 years onâ€”but also a turning point in naval warfare. The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first occasion when the great forces of aircraft carriers became dominant strategically. Of course, it was followed not long after by the Battle of Midway and from then there has been the exercise of power through aircraft carriers that has dominated the world to the present time. So, strategically, it was not only an important event for Australia but also significant in the changes it brought to the nature and character of warfare.

        However, it is on the future that I wanted to speak. The beginnings of that Australian-American relationship go way back to the days of first settlement, but the military links and the strategic links and the links towards the pursuit of peace that led to the formation of ANZUS in the postwar years in fact began at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The lessons of that relationship are important. Sadly I have not time to canvass them all, but to my mind the ANZUS relationship is as important today as it has been at any time during the Cold War.

We may be smaller, we may not be as significant in world terms, but we have an enormous influence on the United States. That is something that is reflected not only in the presence of Secretary Cheney, Secretary Alexander and Secretary Stone but in the words spoken by President Bush during his recent visit to Australia and by the feeling of all those who now are celebrating that brief but significant occurrence on 7 May and 8 May, 50 years ago.

I want to say that, as someone who spent two years living in the United States and teaching at a university in the United States, I came to know the American people well. Sometimes the image that we gain of the American people overseas is not necessarily a correct one.

While there are many things that we can learn from them, there are also some things that they can learn from us.

        Part 4 of the motion before the House reaffirms the continuing importance of security and cooperation between the United States and Australia. Australia's military and security relations with the United States were forged in the dark days of World War II. World War II brought about a reassessment of Australia's defence needs and capabilities. As a result, the strong alliance with the United States of America was formed. This alliance was formalised with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty in 1951. Since that time, Australian and American service men and women have fought side by side in three wars: in Korea, Vietnam and most recently in the Gulf. The security of the United States and of Australia is inextricably linked, and the ANZUS Treaty is fundamental to that relationship.

        â€”I have very great pleasure in joining in the debate on this motion. I think the importance of the occasion is demonstrated by the number of very important people who were our allies in this battle who have come to Australia from the United States. They include the Secretary of the Army, Mr Michael Stone, and the Secretary of the Navy, Mr H. Lawrence Garrett, who are both in Australia for these celebrations. These are very important people and a gathering such as this is very unusual.

        I lived through that period. I was very young, but I recall the drama of the time. I have heard those who were involved talking about it. My father was in New Guinea during the period of the Second World War. There is no doubt that every Australian, and certainly every Australian leader, at the time believed that Australia was under threat.

        I have no doubt that, no matter what academics might find 50 years later, a real threat did exist for Australia. Whilst they may not have planned it, had the Japanese had an easy victory on the Kokoda Trail, or had they been able to get a decisive victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea, they would have been a threat to Australia itself. Those in Townsville and Darwin know well that war did take place on Australian soil.

        I think it is unfortunate that some, in trying to justify some political end of their own and not a political end party-wise, have suggested, even on Coral Sea Day itself, that we should have left our troops in the Middle East, fought the European war and ignored Australia. I want to say that every person who fought in the Coral Sea Battle, and everyone who fought in New Guinea, fought because they believed they were fighting for Australia and because they believed that their lives were placed on the line in the interests of their country. So I believe that it is quite improper for anyone to suggest that any Australian leader of that time could have taken any decision other than that which was taken.

The Gold Coast based Coral Sea Battle Commemorative Association arose from friendly discussions about the Coral Sea Battle between a small group of Allied ex-service men and women, including the late American Colonel Bennett D. Farnham of the US Army. There was until recently almost total ignorance of this historical event. Today's debate has been extremely helpful in raising public awareness of the importance of the Battle of the Coral Sea.

Of those, 7,964 died in captivity and many have died since as a result of their experiences, especially those who worked on the infamous Burma railway.

         The Prime Minister's comments at Kokoda contrasted in a most invidious fashion the role our soldiers played there with the role of those who had defended Australia in the Middle East. My father served in the 6th Division of the 2nd AIF there. It is incredible that the Prime Minister should have sought at Kokoda to diminish in some way the role, for example, of the 9th Division under General Morshead at Tobrukâ€”they were the so-called Rats of Tobruk. The siege at Tobruk was one of the most famous battle honours in the history of Australia's military forces. It has been described in some circles as the Gallipoli of World War II. Here for the first time the Germans were shown to be resistible. The defence of Tobruk cost 823 Australian lives. Does the Prime Minister suggest that their sacrifice there was somehow less than those brave soldiers who gave their lives at Kokoda?

Valuable experience was gained. The eventual return of those battle hardened divisions was a significant element in the fight against and the defeat of the Japanese.

But let us not diminish in any way the brave acts and the contribution that those soldiers made to the defence of Australia in the early dark years of the war. April 1941, for example, was a very dark time of the war, as the Germans appeared to be invincible.

         The background of these people is worthy of a brief mention. Before Mr Plenty was married he spent six months in the national service in preparation to defend this country with his life. Immediately after they were married in January 1959, he and his wife left their families in South Australia and went to Albany in Western Australia to pioneer a virgin block of land, with very meagre resources. Living in a caravan for the first seven years, with no electricity, as true pioneers would they worked tirelessly as a husband and wife team to clear their land, as well as raising three children.

         However, just when they were beginning to get on top of things and were branching out in a further farming property, in June 1968 they were involved in a motor car accident in which no liability whatsoever was attached to them. However, they were both injured. Mr Plenty's injuries were severe enough to force him off his newly developed farm as he was no longer able to do the work required of him to run the farm successfully. Mr Plenty was injured in his right knee and in his back. On the advice of his doctors he gave his surgeon unrestricted permission to operate on his right knee and remove the whole of his kneecap.

         He underwent surgery the day after the accident, but it was not until later that Mr Plenty learnt that the surgeon removed only a part of the kneecap. The surgeon assured Mr Plenty that he would ultimately have a 100 per cent recovery. However, this failed to eventuate. Obviously, Mr Plenty suffered a great deal of pain and distress.

         Mr Plenty was given no assurance whatsoever from either his original surgeon or his specialist orthopaedic surgeon in Perth that any further surgery or treatment would ever improve his disabilities, let alone cure them. Therefore, believing that any further surgery would be imprudent, and also being forced at that stage by the compulsory government third party insurance company to decide whether to accept a meagre offer of settlement or take them to court, Mr Plenty took his case to the third party claims tribunal of Western Australia, believing that he would be justly treated and compensated for his pain and suffering, his incapacities and his economic losses.

         However, contrary to the evidence, the trial judge found that Mr Plenty had been unreasonable in not undergoing further surgery, as the judge believed that some further surgery would cure Mr Plenty for a certain period of time, even to the extent of stiffening the leg as a cure. As such, he said that Mr Plenty had been unreasonable in not mitigating his damages. Consequently, the trial judge did not give Mr Plenty any compensation whatsoever for his pain, incapacity or economic losses.

Implicit in what it said was that if he refused to have any further surgery before going to a retrial he could be devastatingly penalised for failing to mitigate his damages, to such an extent that he could lose all, including having all costs given against him. This was even though it had already accepted that there was no evidence of any real prospect of any cure, for any length of time, from any further surgery being carried out.

         The appeal court judges departed from the recognised standard of proof in cases where a claimant is accused of not mitigating his damages. They falsely applied every authority they used so that they insidiously shifted the onus back onto Mr Plenty in such a way that for him to have any chance of success of qualifying for any compensation, he would be compelled to become like a mercenary and forced to undergo some unwarranted, unrecommended, mad operation in order to prove that further surgery would fail and that he was not unreasonable.

         This insidious and appalling judgment barbarically places Mr Plenty in an absolutely `can't win' situation. Amongst other things, it is totally contrary to the International Declaration of Human Rights and our own Human Rights Act through the compulsion it places on Mr Plenty to have further surgery before he has any chance at all of receiving justice. The consequence of this state of affairs is that the Plentys are left with a very perplexing and absolutely untenable situation. They have made every possible effort known to them, including trying to get solicitors to responsibly seek a remedy in the courts of this country. However, every solicitor they have approached has given them plenty of sympathy but has refused to take their instructions so that a remedy can be found to a situation which has cost them thousands of dollars over the years.

         Because of the failure of solicitors, the Plentys have been forced into the unwanted situation of having to represent themselves in various legal matters resulting from the car accident. They have discovered, firstly, that there is a fault with the High Court rules which prevents them from representing themselves, or from seeking leave to appeal to the High Court. The Plentys say that this is a result of the High Court judges' attitude to section 78 of the Judiciary Act. Order 69A rule 11 of the High Court rules restricts such an application to counsel. The High Court judges also have made it very clear to the Plentys, by inference, that even when there is a right for them to represent themselves, they will not allow this to occur.

         Secondly, the Plentys have discovered that there is a conflict of interest between solicitors and the courts, in that solicitors are officers of the court and their first duty is to the protection of the court and not to their client. That means that where there is a fault with the court against the client, such as in the Plentys' case, then solicitors will generally not take up that fault with the court. Thirdly, the Plentys have discovered that the High Court has obstructed them from commencing any proceedings themselves in the High Court.

Over the years these problems have been brought to the attention of all members of parliament, including Treasurers, but without solution.

         The Plentys say that one thing that might help them is if legislation could be altered, or else made, in two areas. The first change is in the area of the High Court rules or the Judiciary Act, to allow personal representation to the High Court upon seeking leave to appeal. The second is that appropriate legislation be made to remove solicitors as officers of the Court. This would remove any conflict of interest, so that there would be absolutely no fetter placed upon solicitors to represent their clients as their first duty, instead of, as currently, acting as Judases. The State courts would eventually follow, as the State courts are generallyâ€”if not entirelyâ€”bound by precedents set by the High Court.

         As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of one of Australia's most significant naval conflicts, the Battle of the Coral Sea, it is important to reflect on some of the historical background. Early in 1942, Allied political leaders agreed that the United States would accept responsibility for the Pacific war theatre, including Australia and New Zealand, and that Britain would be responsible for the Indian Ocean and Middle East theatres. The European and Atlantic areas would be a joint US and British responsibility.

         From Australia's point of view this basic grand strategy, to beat Hitler first, was both significant and emotive. This meant that, in spite of the Japanese successes, priority for arms and men would be allotted to the European theatre and that, until Hitler was disposed of, the Allied forces in the Pacific were committed to a strategic defensive.

         United States Admiral Chester Nimitz was appointed to the overall command of the Pacific area. After consultations with Prime Minister Curtin, the American Government appointed General Douglas MacArthurâ€”who had arrived in Australia a few days earlier from the Philippinesâ€”as Supreme Commander of the south-west Pacific area, which included Australia. The appointment of MacArthur relieved, to a degree, the deep anxiety and criticisms of the Australian people.

         Apart from the physical losses, what therefore were the net results of this historic five-day battle? Firstly, it created a precedent in naval history because the opposing surface forces were never in sight of each other. All combat involved aircraft either in air-to-air combat or aircraft against surface warships. Secondly, while the Japanese arguably had won a tactical victoryâ€”referred to as such in the MacArthur papersâ€”in the sense that they inflicted greater losses than they themselves sustained, more significantly they suffered a strategic defeat, their first major naval setback of World War II.

         Port Moresby had been saved from a two-pronged frontal assault because the Japanese had been forced to abort the seaborne invasion plan. They could not at that time renew the seaborne attack because the combined force was about to mount a maximum naval effort in the central Pacific. They were forced, therefore, to postpone that attack until July and to carry that out across the Kokoda Trail.

         A third by-product was that, although no aircraft carriers had been provided for MacArthur's naval commander, the prime role played by carriers in the Coral Sea was not lost on either Curtin or MacArthur who reiterated earlier demands for aircraft carriers, without which they claimed the south-west Pacific naval force could not be regarded as a balanced one.

However, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's visit this week comes on the heels of President Bush's visit in January and offers an opportunity for both countries to explore new dimensions of that alliance in the aftermath of the Cold War's end and of US withdrawal from its bases in the Philippines.

         The former Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Macedonia now meets these tests. It meets these tests because not only does it have, in fact, a democratically elected and stable government and controlled and secure borders, but it has a permanent population, it can enter into relations with other states and, importantly, a referendum showed that 95 per cent of the population supported the independence of Macedonia. That referendum was held on 8 September 1991.

         I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that customs tariff proposal No. 2 of 1992  refers to the Republic of Macedonia, so there is already some recognition of it as the Republic of Macedonia. However, unfortunately, it has not been possible to acquire recognition of Macedonia by the European Commission.

         In this process, I wish to place clearly on record that the principle of tolerance is what democracies are about, that is, tolerance of alternative views within your country and tolerance of alternative views outside your country, at the same time respecting the processes by which you can form views. What I find is most under threat in this respect is this matter of tolerance. It is sad to say that, in taking this position, my colleague the honourable member for Throsby and I have been subjected to a great deal of criticism, considerable abuse and, might I say, threats from people who believe that we ought not to raise this question of the right of Macedonia to exist independently.

It is not an issue that concerns me in terms of parliamentary privilege, but it is an issue that concerns me in terms of the way we conduct debate in this part of the twentieth century. The issue is fundamentally that Macedonia has a right to exist. It has a population that wishes to call itself the Republic of Macedonia. It has gone through the processes and believes that it has a right to exist. Unfortunately, others have not extended such tolerance to them.

It is interesting that in this society of ours in which we have talked about multiculturalism, in which we have said that there ought to be a right for people to have differing views and differing cultures, some of those people who are so strongly propounding the policy of multiculturalism will not extend that policy to the recognition of Macedonia.

         â€”I thank my colleague the honourable member for Petrie. They will stand on street corners and talk about multiculturalism and they will come to Canberra and argue with us about multiculturalism, yet when you wish to extend that principle to another group which they do not support, they say, `No, you cannot pursue the policy of multiculturalism'. I have to say that I am not one of those who are completely won over to the view of multiculturalism, because I think that ultimately it leads to the development of an ethnic professional lobby which does not always represent its rank and file members. I think it is fraught with difficulty. But it is even more fraught with difficulty when they do not in their own hearts believe in the principle of tolerance, which says that if someone else wishes to call themselves something, provided it does not deny my right to exist, then they should have the right to call themselves that.

         I have no objections to my colleagues within the parliamentary forum or in the wider community taking on names and roles, provided that within that there is embodied the principle of tolerance. That is the fundamental underpinning of democracy. Might I say that some of the most adamant opponents of this are some people who live very close to the borders of Macedonia, who would believe that the people of Macedonia do not have the right to call themselves Macedonians, even though they would call themselves democratic. That kind of inconsistency is unacceptable, in my eyes. I find it deplorable that some people would accept that view of the world; it is a very narrow view. We cannot possibly persist in celebrating this emergence of democracy in the world when at the same time we are denying a right to two million people, who are some of the very poorest people in the world, who are threatened currently by the Serbian military, as many others in that former Yugoslavia are, and who are currently being threatened because of their claims to call themselves Macedonian.

         How can we in this Parliament stand up and say, `We are not going to accept that you have the right to call yourself Macedonian'? It is totally inconsistent and unacceptable practice, in my view. I also say that I not only find comfort in the support of colleagues here today, and I thank them for that, particularly the honourable member for Throsby, I also find comfort in the support of Mr Robert Badinter, who led the special commission of arbitration set up by the European Commission, who came down strongly in favour of Macedonia being recognised as an independent and sovereign state because it has satisfied all the stipulated criteria for such recognition. In other words, it has met all the tests that we would set, yet at the end of it some of us say no, and some in the European community say no.

         I have sought to refrain from any criticism of people in Greece or the Greek Government. Would that it were true that they had shown such tolerance to me, but they have not, nor to my colleagues who have taken up this cause, and that tells you something fundamental about their incapacity to recognise that tolerance is a two-way street. This process is not set about with the intention of making any claims either historically or territorially against the people of Greece or the Greek Government or those who have come from Greece to Australia. It does not entail that at all. It is simply that I, the member for Stirling, and my colleague the honourable member for Throsby, and I am sure other colleagues, are standing in this place and saying that we believe that people from Macedonia have a right to call themselves Macedonian and to exist, because they meet the test that we have applied to other states, for example Slovenia and Croatia.

In the end, are we prepared to cast aside the simple aspirations of people who, as I say, are some of the poorest in Europe? According to Richard Farmer, it is a country of two million people and has an army of 15,000. It does not have an anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapon, let alone tanks and aircraft of its own.

         â€”Many members in this place I think were saddened this week to hear the news that one of the principal regional airline companies in New South Wales, namely Hazelton Airlines, was to be absorbed into the Australian Airlines group. I have no criticism of that particular absorption, but I would like to take some time in today's grievance debate to pay tribute to the principal of that airline, Mr Max Hazelton, and members of his family and staff who have done so much over the last 20 years to pioneer regional airlines in western New South Wales.

         There is no doubt that Max Hazelton was one of the most innovative regional airline operators in Australia. One would hope that, following the takeover, Max will still have a hands-on job to play with the running of that particular airline, because that company pioneered so many things that have contributed to the people of western New South Wales and the north-west of New South Wales receiving regular and reliable air transport.

         It would be fairly obvious that the recession we had to have and the incredible downturn in the rural communities of Australia may have had something to do with the sale of Hazelton Airlines to the Australian Airlines group. But there was probably no sterner critic of government policy than Max Hazelton. I refer particularly to some of the very real difficulties that he and other regional airline operators have had in this country in recent years. Real difficulties were imposed on those who operated throughout New South Wales, especially, by the institution of the peak period pricing policy of the Government at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the fact that that really added to their costs and their chargesâ€”charges that probably could not be passed on to their passengers at a time of rural recession when passenger numbers were dwindling.

         It also raises the point of the whole area of administration of aviation in Australia. We are going through a most difficult time. We have seen the situation this week, for example, where we have had near revolt throughout the entire general aviation industry around Australia about three Bills that were due to enter this House today. I refer principally to the safety levy that was to be put on general aviation and the aviation industry across Australia to provide safety services.

It said, `We aren't going to have a part of this because this will wreck the general aviation industry'. The Labor Caucus threw that Bill out and sent it back to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and to the Cabinet and said, `We don't want any bar of this'. Yet it was typical of the attitude that has been taken by the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) in terms of the administration of aviation in Australia.

         I have not always been the number one fan of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). We had some classic debates in the period when he was Minister for Aviation, but I must say that he did have a lot of foresight in terms of some of the work that he did in conjunction with the Bosch inquiry of 1984. He was the Minister that was responsible. I think it is true to say that across both sides of this particular Parliament and in the aviation industry generally there was a realisation that there was a better way of organising aviation in this country.

         The fact that the CAA was taken out of the grips of government and that the Federal Airports Corporation was established to provide efficiency and, hopefully, competition in the system were welcomed by all.

         What happened? It only took about two years and we had cost recovery in toto. By 1988, cost recovery in the Australian aviation business was there and the plan of Mr Bosch to bring it in over 10 years went by the way. We had an instant imposition of it. I suppose we could argue that at that time rural industries were doing quite well, the aviation industry generally was doing quite well and, despite the fact that people like Max Hazelton struggled, they met those charges. But once that downturn came in, what we saw was not an easing of the cost recovery program but almost a vicious grab by this Government to milk the aviation industry more and more.

Quite frankly, if the Government had brought in the aviation safety charge levy I think there was every possibility that we would have seen the destruction of general aviation in Australia.

One of the advantages of the Bosch committee report and the way things were going was that a great deal of the regulation of industry was being left to the industry.

         As we move through this whole area of aviation administration, look at the privatisation process that is going on at the moment. That is really quite remarkable. While it falls within the ambit of the Minister for Finance, we really wonder what is going on. Yes, there have to be security provisions and secrecy provisions in these things. But we are learning day by day now that any of the bidders for either Australian or Qantas who have not got the involvement of a foreign carrier in their bid are quietly being told that they can go away because they will not be able to get to the next stage where they can get access to the documentation of these particular airlines to make the full substantial bid.

I do not know how they are going to overcome the absolute disaster that is developing there.

The special Commission of Arbitration set up by the European Community and led by Mr Robert Badinter has come down strongly in favour of Macedonia being recognised as an independent and sovereign state because it has satisfied all the stipulated criteria for such recognition. Indeed, as recently as this past week the states of the European Community still refused to recognise the independence of Macedonia because of pressure being exerted by Greece.

         The European Community has a consensus based decision making process and Greece has insisted that the republic of Macedonia must change its name before it will agree to recognise its independence and Macedonia will not bow to this unjust pressureâ€”and why should it? Making Macedonia's recognition conditional on a change of name to suit others is without precedent and violates all codes of international law and practice.

         I am saddened at the behaviour of Greece. Macedonia has clearly stated it has absolutely no territorial pretences towards its neighbours and has stated it is ready to sign an agreement with Greece on the inviolability of borders. Perhaps Greece is worried that the world might become more and more aware of the plight of the Macedonian minority in Greece where many people are still being denied basic human rights.

         We welcome the fact that Australia has been quick to recognise the new found freedoms of independence of many countries, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Why are we hesitating in giving recognition to Macedonia? I know we have the desire to wait for the European Community to move before we do, but sometimes a country has to stand up and be counted. Sometimes when principles are at stake Australia can show the way. We have done that in the past.

I represent one of the most multicultural areas in Australia and I support multiculturalism. As the honourable member for Stirling so rightly said, there are people who come to see us and demand that we give our support to multiculturalism, and it is surprising, when an issue comes up with which they might not agree, that they want to deny that right to others.

         â€”I preface my remarks by paying a tribute to those who were involved in the Battle of the Coral Sea. I appreciate the fact that there has been discussion in the chamber this morning concerning it, but not all of those who wished to speak were able to make a contribution. I would like especially to pay a tribute to our own service personnel who served there, and certainly to the Americans. It was delightful to see the Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, here in Parliament throughout the week. I also feel that this has been the opportunity for Australians generally, particularly young Australians, to learn something about the Coral Sea Battle and the history of the last war, and to be able to recognise that we as an island state can be under threat, even though it was 50 years ago that this actually did occur. But with modern warfare it certainly must be a warning to us that we always have to be prepared to defend this very great land of ours.

There have been questions asked and there has been much actual discussion within the Parliament here, but there is much more discussion out in the wider world of Australia. There are many people, I am sure, in your electorate of Wide Bay, Mr Deputy Speaker, in my electorate of Lyne and elsewhere who are in touch with us and are drawing our attention to one important factorâ€”that our Australian flag is a personal flag for each Australian, and we should not forget that we served in war under the flag and our sportsmen have played under it.

         I want to talk about primary industry in Australia. I think there are times when we take it for granted and we seem to be able to say, `Righto, the old farmer is there, he is going to continue on, he is going to be responsible for actually contributing to the balance of payments over the year'. We assume that the farmer will increase his efficiency, production will go up and the farmer, the primary industry person, will be largely responsible over the years to come for the general wealth and the prosperity of most of our Australians.

         This has been the case in the past, but might I say that we have rationalised ourselves here, and so have other rural countries. Back in the early 1960s, the EEC countries recognised that they had to become self-sufficient in the production of foodstuffs, so they embarked upon a course of assisting the farmer in order to keep consumer prices down. It was in 1969 that the EEC countries became self-sufficient, but they continued to subsidise and support their farmers. Consequently, we have a situation at the moment where they are producing much more than is needed so far as their domestic requirements are concerned, so they are subsidising and dumping around different parts of the world many of their commodities that are in strong competition with our farmers here in Australia. The United States of America followed that course and it too, in order to compete against the EEC, decided to give financial support in different ways to the farmers throughout America. So it was that most countries had to follow suit to keep their primary industries alive.

         Where has this left Australian farmers? Our three major partiesâ€”the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and, apparently, the National Party, to which I belongâ€”have a program to do away with basic support to primary industries. I am rather concerned about the matter. We had an illustration of it only a week or so ago. The sugar growers of Australia called upon the Government and the Opposition to give them some support because reductions in tariffs were affecting the prosperity of those industries.

Whoever is in government in this country must be flexible enough to say, `If you get into trouble because of your exports or your seasons, which are very important, thenâ€”because of your importance to the economy of this nation, its employment and prosperityâ€”we are prepared to come to your aid'. Honourable senators should have a look around this country at the moment at what governments are doing on the social security side and the health side, providing people here and grants there and regulating particular areas of the economy. I know they are different to primary industry and manufacturing industry, but they are there and we are regulating those areas. At times I think they might be better not so regulated. They might better be placed into the hands of the local people who understand.

         In this country, a farmer is a practical person. He might not necessarily be a theorist, but he is a practical person. He has a lot of money invested in real estate and property. This is the important thing: his aim is to maintain and increase his productivity, to maintain the quality of the product that he turns out, to maintain the quality of the soil and stock that he owns. How important that is to a country like Australia that has really grown, as we say, on the sheep's back. Time does not permit me to say many of the things that I want to say, but I emphasise again that if the farmers, the primary industry people, of this country want help, they should get it.

         â€”Mareeba and Dimbulah in my electorate are large tobacco growing areas. Whether we like it or not, tobacco is a legal product, yet it seems to me that the Opposition is intent on punishing tobacco growers, who are looking at certain economic ruin should the coalition ever get into government. For example, on page 83 of the so-called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         While clearly the Opposition's policies spell financial ruin for tobacco farmers, there are policies of this Government that are also of concern to my constituents in Mareeba and Dimbulah. Last month I went doorknocking in Dimbulah. Just about every person I spoke to raised concerns about the future of the tobacco industry in view of this Government's commitment to reducing the number of smokers in the community. I must say I do not personally think smoking is such a good idea and I support the Government's efforts to reduce the numbers of smokers in the community and lessen the burden of tobacco related deaths on the health system. However, where paternalistic policy measures such as tobacco advertising bans or increases in tobacco excise directly affect the viability of farmers then it is incumbent on the Government to provide an appropriate compensation or crop substitution scheme for those farmers.

         In Mareeba the annual rodeo, which is one of the most popular in the north, has traditionally been sponsored by tobacco companies. As a result of the ban on cigarette advertising at sports events, the rodeo organising committee is now desperately trying to find alternative sponsors. The irony is that the most likely sponsor to step in and save the day will be an alcohol beverage company. As we all know, the cost to the public health purse as a result of alcohol related disease and violence makes tobacco look like a cheap miracle drug.

         It is easy to see why tobacco farmers are feeling threatened. They are the innocent victims of deliberate Government policies to minimise cigarette consumption. Some, of course, may argue that tobacco farmers would be better off if we banned tobacco products altogether, as there is no doubt that farmers will have to be compensated and assisted to get out of the industry. My colleague Senator Jim McKiernan has put such a tongue in cheek motion to the Caucusâ€”not bad, of course, coming from a bloke who blows out more smoke than the stack at Mount Isa.

         The fact is that we do not have to go as far as a complete ban to justify the provision of a compensation arrangement for tobacco farmers. What we now have is a deliberate Government policy to minimise tobacco consumption which directly affects the viability of the tobacco industry. Tobacco growers are, indeed, good, honest and hardworking people. The Opposition's policies will wipe them out altogether and immediately. Our own Government's policies need to be looked at very closely indeed.

As I said, they are hardworking people; they deserve a fair go.

The southern African region is experiencing a severe drought, the worst in 50 years. That includes the country of Mozambique. The outlook for the 1991-92 growing season will be the worst in many years and is aggravated by the fact that the traditional suppliers, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland and South Africa, are also affected. Since 1985 World Vision Mozambique has executed an intensive support program for victims of the country's 15-year-old civil war and through the importation and distribution of food and non-food commodities the program has allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced persons to cope with the effects the war has had on their lives. Now, in 1992, a drought threatens to devastate a country that has already suffered for far too long. This afternoon, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be very interested to know that the Director of World Vision will be here at 4.30 p.m. in room 1R1.

I would like to read some names to the Parliament: Zolik Rekhson, aged 6, whose death place was in Minsk in Russia; Moshe Luftig, aged 13, death place Krakow in Poland; Riva Sokolski, aged 10, death place Minsk in Russia; Rita Lissak, aged 13, death place Treblinka; Bebi Odenberg, aged 9, death place Sobibor; Fridel Ganzman, aged 1, death place Russia. They were just some of the six million victims of the Holocaust. We ought never forget that the acts of the Nazi Germans saw six million Jewish people die. The people I have mentioned, aged 6, 13, 10, 13, 9 and 1, surely could not have been a threat to any state.

         Civil aviation had the understanding there would be no change to safety levels. The Government intended to change that. Three Bills that had been placed before the Parliament but that had not been debated have been withdrawn because the committee said, `We will not tolerate this'. I pay a tribute to its members. At last we see some commonsense on some of the issues where I believe that the Government is intent on user pays to a silly end because the Government has no appreciation of just what civil aviation is doing to Australia. Earlier today we heard the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), paying a tribute to the Hazeltons. I pay a tribute to the Hazeltons, to Max Hazelton and to other groups that have more or less pioneered travel throughout country areas of our State.

There are a few other points in regard to the Opposition's attitude that need to be recognised. The Opposition intends, under the GST, to tax child-care to the tune of $130m and compensate it by $90m, which means a loss of $40m. What that really means is that it is going to tax kids; it is going to tax child-care. This comes from a party that wants to destroy unemployment benefits, destroy universal health cover and destroy low cost housing. As I have said in this House before, what one gets when one does that is Los Angeles. That is what those on the other side of the House are about, as well as destroying award conditions.

Because of State Government cutbacks in funding and the restrictive guidelines under which the Victorian Correspondence School is forced to operate, rural students are being denied equal access to a range of subjects. Students wishing to continue to study a second language have been impeded by unclear enrolment guidelines.

It is essential that students in Victorian country schools have the same access to a varied curriculum as their counterparts in the larger cities.

It is a matter of concern to me that rights to sporting series are bought by television networks and they very often do not show those particular sporting activities or, if they do, they show them at very late hours of the day. I refer in particular to the coverage by Channel 9 of rugby league, which in Western Australia has virtually disappeared off the television screens, though it still is carried by Channel 2. I also refer to the coverage of AFL by Channel 7, which I think performs a better service but chooses to juggle the times of showing, which are not necessarily convenient to its viewers.

         This issue ought to be addressed. If in fact the television stations buy the rights to a sporting series and then do not exercise those rights, they should forfeit them and they should go to another television station that can provide the service. I use the example of the Wimbledon finals three years ago, in 1989. Channel 9 had both the Test cricket and the Wimbledon final and it enlisted the aid of Channel 2 to cover the cricket. It is very important that Australian viewers are given access to these sporting broadcasts.

This association has been a voluntary amateur association running for some 63 years, which every 10 years has a renewable lease of the courts it now plays on. It has over that period trained many professional tennis players but, most particularly, at the moment, has something like 700 in the association. It is, as I said, an amateur club. It trains juniors and seniors, and it even has an aged team that competes successfully throughout the districts. Its courts are renowned for the work that has been put in on a voluntary basis. Now, I think, the Council sees it as an asset from which it can gain extra revenue.

         I appeal to the Council and the elected representatives to have consideration for what an amateur group has done over 63 years within the Fairfield City, and most particularly to preserve its rights to control, as an amateur group, those particular facilities. I would like to see it expand in what it is trying to do and that in future, the lease is of a longer term than what has been granted to it in the past. We need to encourage the amateur part of our sporting endeavours. Most particularly, we need to encourage those people who give up so much of their time in training the juniors within our communities. I would like to say to Fairfield City Council that it should reconsider the action it is contemplating in taking away the lease of this particular group and acknowledge the work that has been undertaken by this group and its predecessors over the last 63 years within our Fairfield City Council area.

It is worth focusing on that for a minute because, whilst there has been over the last few months a substantial concentration on the situation of teenagers in unemployment, certain things need to be said about it. The percentage of that age group unemployed is about 9.3 per cent, compared
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          with 12.3 per cent in April 1983. Indeed, in total numbers, there were 34,000 fewer unemployed teenagers in April this year than there were in April 1983. This is because young people are where they ought to beâ€”in training, in schools, in universities, and in TAFEs.

         Considerable effort has been spent on the part of this Government over the last nine years to put them exactly where they ought to be. There will be further effort, at least if this Government retains office, to ensure that even greater numbers are educatedâ€”which I must say is an extraordinary contrast in the huge number of contrasts now being opened up between this side of politics in Australia and the other side.

         Quite clearly, the unemployment figures that we confront these days give us no joy at all. We can contrast them, of course, with the situation that existed in 1983. If they had had the participation rates then that we have now as a result of our encouraging more and more people into the work force, the level of unemployment under them for this month would have been 13.5 per cent back in 1983.

         We take no particular joy from that contrast because we want people to participate in the Australian work force, and we want them to participate in the Australian work force in relevant jobs. Because those relevant jobs are there, because the training is there and because, as I said, those leading indicators are now performing in the way in which I described we, at least on this side of the House, offer hope to this country of something a bit better than dead end jobs in the not too distant future.

         â€”I did see the article and, whilst I have not had an opportunity to check all the facts, I understand that it is broadly accurate, though it somewhat understates the current value of Commonwealth Government indexed bonds on issue. The issue of indexed bonds helps the private sector to provide indexed pensions, and the Government sees advantages in persons retiring with indexed pensions rather than simply living off lump sums.

         The demand for index linked securities will grow as the Government's retirement income policy encourages more retirees to take up complying annuities. But at this stage the main organisations paying CPI index pensions in Australia continue to be governments rather than those private sector providers.

         For the 1991-92 financial year, the Commonwealth has budgeted to pay a total of $2.2 billion in indexed pensions to retired Commonwealth employees, public servants, retired Australia Post and Telecom employees, et cetera, and also retired members of the defence forces. These pensions are adjusted each July in line with the CPI movement over the 12 months to March of that year. The Government would have to legislate if it wanted to abrogate the CPI adjustment.

         Under those circumstances, it is very strange that the Opposition's Fightback document contains no allowance for the additional cost to the Government of adjusting those pensions when the Opposition's proposed new tax pushes the CPI up. Does the Opposition intend to legislate to stop the CPI adjustment? Is it being deliberately quiet about that? In other words, is it not telling Commonwealth retirees that it does not intend to adjust their pensions for the inflationary consequences of the introduction of the new tax? Or is this just another piece of faulty arithmetic on the part of the Leader of the Opposition? I am sure that all those pensioners in the community would like an answer to this question.

         Another apparent hole in the Opposition's package is that it omits any figure for the cost of the CPI adjustment to the indexed Treasury bonds. Is the Opposition intending to renege on the Commonwealth's contractual obligation to bond holders, or is it, as we suspect, yet another example of the Opposition's erroneous arithmetic?

         Another example exists as well. Whilst Treasury notes are not formally index linked securities, they are short dated and the stock is regularly rolled over through a process of competitive market tendering. That competitive process means the yield is set by the market and incorporates a market determined rate of compensation for the expected rate of inflation. If the market believed the Opposition that the consumption tax would have only a one-off effect on the CPI and that effect would be limited, as the Opposition suggests, to 4.7 per cent, the competitive tender process would automatically build that figure into the interest yields on the Commonwealth's outstanding treasury notes. This should have appeared as a one-off effect on the public debt interest outlays in the 1994-95 year of Fightback's costings. Its omission is another clear error in Fightback's costings.

         I have not mentioned the indexed pensions paid by State governments to their ex-employees because I suppose the Leader of the Opposition has in mind that he would expect them to abrogate their own CPI adjustments of those pensions. If not, he should be expected to compensate the States for the cost of meeting the CPI jump in those State funded pensions.

         I have not bothered to put a dollar figure on this last item, but the other three alone add up to over three-quarters of a billion dollars over the three years on which the Opposition claims to have fully calculated the cost of its package. This is another three-quarters of a million dollar hole. It is another three-quarters of a million dollar credibility gap that the Opposition Leader has to contend with. That is on top of the $1 1/2 billion credibility gap that I revealed on Tuesday, on top of the $3.9 billion credibility gap that was revealed by my predecessor last December. That adds up to $6 billion. So at last, the Leader of the Opposition has become the $6 billion man as a result of his own faulty arithmetic. How often have we heard these brave claims about the Opposition's fully-costed programs?

Of course, the major benefit of that system is that it provides protection to all employees, regardless of their bargaining power or lack of it, against exploitation.

         If the award system were ended, or even made more difficult to access, there would clearly be greater scope for exploitation of sections of the work force, which would be forced to accept substantial reductions in conditions of employment. This has been clearly shown by examples that have already been given to the House in respect of New Zealand, which until last year had a similar award-based system to our own. Then it deregulated the labour market, that is, it abolished awards as they ran out, and thenceforth provided that employment conditions would be set by contracts of employment.

         It is a matter of great concern that the Opposition is proposing a similar system for Australia to that which currently exists in New Zealand. Many lower income earners in Australia, but not just lower income earners, would clearly be at risk of being worse off, as the New Zealand example shows. There could be a dramatic deterioration in conditions, and the only alternative that employees would have if they did not like that situation would be to take the sack. The Opposition has said that there would still be the protection of a minimum wage but, as the honourable member for Bennelongâ€”or the dead-end kid, as we probably should call him nowâ€”has admitted that that minimum wage could be below the award rate.

Eighty per cent of Australian employees are covered by awards; 72 per cent of employees have award superannuation entitlement. That gives them a minimum 3 per cent employer contribution. Under the Opposition's proposals, if you lose your award entitlement, you will lose your award superannuation. The employer could possibly continue it, but obviously in many cases would not. It is not just a matter of this Opposition being against the superannuation guarantee levy, which would enhance the minimum amount which currently exists for most employees; it would in fact put a policy in place which would mean that many employees would lose the minimum entitlement of superannuation that they currently have.

         â€”The honourable member's question goes to the point that many of those people living on investments have suffered a decline in their incomes as a result of a reduction in interest rates. That is the consequence of lower inflation in Australia and, as a consequence, lower interest rates. Therefore, those people who in the past were receiving windfall gains from higher interest rates which were experienced over the last couple of years are now coming back to a more normal position. I want to make it clear that it is our objective that interest rates should stay down low, and that will be possible because inflation will stay low. The point to make as far as people on fixed incomes are concerned is that, so long as inflation remains low, an automatic protection is built in for them.

         â€”The worst scourge confronting people on fixed incomes is high levels of inflation, which not only eat away at their savings but also force them into a higher cost of living, year after year. So what we are doing in terms of lower levels of inflation carries with it a great benefit for people on fixed incomes. Of course we have sympathy for those people who have suffered a decline in income, just as we have great sympathy for those people who suffered a decline in income because they lost their job. As interest rates went up, people with investments had their incomes increased as a consequence; other people lost their jobs and saw their incomes diminish as a result.

Of course, some are provided by us in the form of health benefits and so on, and those have been reviewed from time to time; but many of the fringe benefits which are available on the basis of pension entitlements are those provided by State governments, and I suggest that the honourable member direct his attention in that area.

         That is precisely what the Government's policies are producing:  a program of tariff reductions against a background of workplace reform and micro-economic reform in such areas as transport and electricity, with these tariff reductions set out well in advance to provide certainty for investment decisions so that the businesses understand what climate they will be in, that the protection levels are coming down, that the economy is becoming more productive and efficient, that inflation is falling, that interest rates are falling, that a competitive exchange rate mechanism is in place and that we are seeing micro-economic reform.

The fact is that we have seen this proposal for zero tariffs and smokescreen references, but of course the exchange rate movement can still provide protection. In other words, if the exchange rate goes down, the effective level of protection rises. So the Leader of the Opposition is arguing and slipsliding on the basis, `Look, we can have a zero level of protection because if the exchange rate goes down, that may in fact lead to an increase in effective protection above even the 5 percentage point nominal level'.

Well, you had better tell that to your leader who said yesterday that he aimed to eliminate tariffs. Maybe we are a little simple and `eliminate' does not mean `zero'; but it does mean zero. References to the movement in the exchange rate lifting or lowering levels of effective protection are valid only if one assumes also that the exchange rate can rise and lower the level of effective protection. If you have got a zero tariff rate, what are you then supposed to do? In your terms of reference, you add on to tariffs, or increase tariffs.

I noticed that, in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the Treasury indicated on page 6 in two tables that the additional superannuation contributions due to the levy would be $11.1 billion per annum by 2000-01. That is, the superannuation guarantee levy will add to national savings to the tune of the current account deficit of Australia every year by the year 2000. Then in the second table it lists the increase in annual post-tax private retirement benefits due to the levy on a cash flow basis, so that by 2030 there will be a further $50 billion per annum going into superannuation.

Out of those important statistics, we have got the Opposition trying to fabricate a case of how the superannuation guarantee levy is not in the national interest and at the same time trying to suggest that the introduction of such a levy will in fact lead to increased unemployment, which, of course, was put down by the Secretary to the Treasury yesterday in his testimony.

         Yet you are not prepared even to support the hard work which has been done by the Government over a decade to sensibly move this into place. There has been no more wilful demonstration of simply wrecking something useful to the national image, to the national interest, than this kind of approach by the Opposition parties in the Senate on this particular levy. It is well and good that the Treasury has stood you up for misrepresenting it and using it, and shamefully abusing it.

Yes, the Government is fully aware of the need for attitudinal change towards science in Australia. Last year, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce commissioned a survey of attitudes of Australians to science and technology. This survey found that many young people felt that there was no association between science and things of value in society, except perhaps for medical breakthroughs.

         Science was seen as a hard subject about discoveries made elsewhere at another time. The stereotype of the scientist as an old, eccentric man in a white coat persisted, and scientists were described by one respondent as nerds and losers. We need to develop in the Australian community a better understanding of how pervasive science is to all aspects of our lives. I am pleased to say that this is a challenge to which the Government has responded and continues to respond. For example, the Government has highlighted science and technology awareness as one of the four key themes to be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper.

         Further, the Government's commitment was underlined last week at the presentation of the Australia Prize. I was delighted that the Prime Minister was able to attend that function and to present the awards. In addition, the Prime Minister has underlined his commitment to the awareness of the fundamental importance of science and technology by requiring that the date of the next meeting of the Science Council be moved in order that he can attend that meeting.

         The importance of the Australia Prize is that it places Australian science in an international context. Globalisation of technology is not just a concept, but an important part of Australia's new and outward looking culture. Of course, science and technology awareness is not just for students and business leaders. Many of the Opposition members in this House would do well to show some interest in this area. It is clear that, at least among the shadow Cabinet, science has no profile. We have been promised an Opposition science policy for many months.

It will continue to weave elements of science into the fabric of future economic initiatives. The science community overwhelmingly understands and respects the Government's record in this area.

Independents who are not part of the governing group sit with the opposition. Just after the last election, I notified the House, and I think I also outlined it to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), who asked me about it, that I would allocate the call by giving the Independentsâ€”at that time it was only the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack)â€”an exact proportion of calls that was entitled to them as people who were entitled to ask questions. One arrives at that using a figure of 120 because approximately 120 members of this House are able to ask questions.

         More than is commonly appreciated in Australia, we have benefited very directly from the achievements of President Suharto's New Order Government over the last 25 years. Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesia's real GDP rose 450 per cent. Over the last few years Indonesia's economic growth has averaged around 7 per cent. It is expected to be around 5 or 6 per cent until the end of the decade.

         Through a sound policy of encouraging foreign investment, bureaucratic reform, financial deregulation and support for manufacturing and lifting of trade barriers, Indonesia has emerged as a dynamic and competitive economic force. Political stability and economic advancement in Indonesia have not only led to dramatic improvements in the standard of living of the Indonesian people; they have also contributed to stability and prosperity in the wider South East Asian region.

         Australia gains from all of this commercially. In 1991, our two-way merchandise trade with Indonesia was worth $2.4 billion. Exports to Indonesia were worth $1.4 billion, making it our tenth largest overseas market. But just as importantly, our national security benefits from a benign environment in the region to our north where not so many years ago there was great uncertainty and volatility.

         In describing the stake Australia has involved in cooperative relations with Indonesia, I readily acknowledge that our relationship with that country has sometimes been strained. Since 1975, East Timor has been a recurring and sometimes divisive issue. My firm conviction is that the only realistic way for us to approach our relationship with Indonesia is to start from the assumption that, as neighbours, each side wants to deal with the other seriously and constructively. We can build a worthwhile relationship if we work on the firm ground of shared interests and develop institutional links which consolidate our progress. We must recognise continuing differences in our cultures and outlooks without allowing ourselves to be obsessed by them.

         This was the basic approach I followed in Indonesia, both in discussions with President Suharto and his Ministers, and in public statements. The centrepiece of my program in Jakarta was a very cordial two-hour discussion with President Suharto. He explained at length the aspirations of the Indonesian people in regard to their independence, their progress in nation-building, and his own concern to nurture stable political institutions. In turn, I described the Government's commitment to lead Australia into wholehearted engagement with Asia. This led us to agree to look for ways to strengthen the institutional framework of the bilateral relationship, to reflect better its growing maturity and diversity, and to guarantee its overall resilience in times of difficulty in specific areas.

         While recognising the importance of the media in both countries, I believe it is not up to them but up to the two governments to set the agenda for the bilateral relationship. The Indonesian Government responded positively to our putting first priority on the establishment of a basis for a long term cooperative relationship. Having established a constructive basis for dialogue, I took appropriate opportunities to raise with President Suharto, Foreign Minister Alatas and Defence Minister Murdani, our concern about the killings in Dili last November and human rights in East Timor. I registered firmly our view that the unhappy situation in East Timor detracts from Indonesia's otherwise impressive achievements, and said it is likely to continue to attract close public attention in Australia.

I made a point of saying that I believed the Australian mediaâ€”and a free press in generalâ€”need not be feared in Indonesia.

         The Prime Minister failed to demonstrate any genuine understanding of what is required to develop our links with the Asia-Pacific region. He certainly failed in any way to provide any substance to the development of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and he showed a characteristic unbelievably embarrassing to most Australians:  a tendency to tug his forelock to the Indonesians, rather than to state in a hard-headed sense what is in Australia's best interests. Most notably, he denigrated the Australian flag on foreign soil and foreshadowed that he would change our flag. He announced that while he was overseas, rather than having the guts to do so in this country. For these and many reasons we are very pleased to have this opportunity to debate this statement today.

Asia was a place that the Prime Minister overflew en route to London and, particularly, Paris to get his French clocks.

         It is also why, in the two years I have been Leader of the Opposition, I have focused on the Asia-Pacific region in my overseas trips. Not only did I visit Indonesia and speak to President Suharto and other Ministers to whom this Prime Minister spoke, as well as others in Papua New Guinea; I have also been right through Asia. I have taken a trade delegation to Taiwan and developed a whole host of other links with the Asia-Pacific region, which demonstrates that I have a much clearer understanding of the direction in which this country can go and the potential that is there for us at this time.

         There are about six major reasons why I believe that the Prime Minister's trip to Indonesia was a conspicuous failure. The first is that he tried to sell it as some sort of dramatic break with our past, some type of new, heroic statesmanship. Just in order to debunk that myth, I thought it was important to go back over the past 30 years to see some of the things that previous Prime Ministers have said in relation to their visits to Indonesia and to see the extent to which the Prime Minister has developed that relationship in any significant sense relative to the statements of the past.

         Not surprisingly, we found that all of these previous leaders, quite appropriately, recognised the scope of President Suharto's contribution to his country and to the region, as our Prime Minister did, and all of them acknowledged historical and cultural differences between Australia and Indonesia, and went on to emphasise common future goals, particularly in terms of economic and security issues. Just to highlight some of those similarities, I think it is useful to go back and look at some of the speeches previous Prime Ministers made and compare those speeches with the words we heard from the Prime Minister today about what he saw as the nature of the link between Australia and Indonesia. I am sure the words of his speech are still ringing in the ears of honourable members, or at least the carry-over from his speech. I will not repeat his words. The similarity is staggering. Let me first quote former Prime Minister Hawke, his predecessor. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I know that we both deeply share the desire for an effective, constructive and enduring relationship between Indonesia and Australia. These two close neighbours, so different in so many ways, but which share so many common interests of the highest and most enduring importance, and I firmly believe that for us, as our nations' leaders, to neglect any opportunity to remove misunderstandings and to strengthen the foundation of agreement would be a dereliction of our duty to both our peoples and a denial of their common destiny in the region which binds us together indissolubly as neighbours.

        Those are very similar words to what our present Prime Minister used. So we can go back to Malcolm Fraser. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me say to you at the outset that it is a fundamental foreign policy objective of the Australian government to consolidate, strengthen and develop over the years ahead a close, cordial and cooperative relationship between Australia and Indonesia.

        It is my government's intention that they will become stronger still.

        Very similar words, very similar sentiments, but there has been no net advancement on this particular occasion over any of those previous visits. So much for this being a major new dramatic approach to Indonesia.

         The second criticism I would make of the Indonesian visit is that the Prime Minister failed to face up to the reality that foreign policy and domestic policy are linked more critically than they have ever been before. In fact, we will not get any respect in a country such as Indonesia if we go  there trying to tell it what we think it wants to hear rather than state what we know to be in Australia's best interests. This Prime Minister certainly does not understand the nature of our economic performance and how our standing in the eyes of the countries in the region has slid so dramatically as our economic performance has fallen off the pace in recent years.

         The Prime Minister went along there making self-serving remarks and trying to make the sorts of statements at dinners that he thinks the Indonesians want to hear. At the same time, President Suharto stood up and left the Prime Minister in absolutely no doubt that he had a very clear-cut view of where Indonesia was going and what he expected of a country such as Australia. Most importantly, he was looking for some words from the Prime Minister to demonstrate that he was serious about getting our economic house in order.

         The Indonesians have a very real interest in seeing us rebuild our economy so that they can benefit from that faster growth in terms of the development of economic trade and investment links. What did the Prime Minister do? Apart from the self-serving remarks, and the remarks that he thought the Indonesians wanted to hear, he promised to change the flag and jettison our British heritage. That must have given the Indonesians a great warm inner glow when it came to getting some satisfaction that he had a clear sense of direction for this country. He failed miserably to show any understanding of the importance of rebuilding our economy as the fundamental basis for any development of that relationship into the future.

         The next reason why I think the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia was a conspicuous failure is that he made the mistake that he could buy new friends in Asia by disowning old ones, by apologising for Australia's past and by committing his Government to changing our flagâ€”the point I made in the introduction. What the Prime Minister must accept, as a majority of his Party clearly does, is that the flag as an issue is a very divisive one in our country. It is totally unnecessary to focus on that issue at this time. It is nothing more than an unnecessary distraction from what is needed to make Australia a dynamic participant in regional economic growth.

         The fifth failure of our Prime Minister on his Indonesian visit was when he said there was no link between aid and human rights. We are not saying that this is a one-to-one link, but we do say that in Australia's situation, in which it gives a reasonable amount of aid to the rest of the world, the allocation of that aid is a decision that we make on the basis of a whole host of considerations, and surely one of those factors has to be human rights. We have to reserve the right to vary our aid as we see fit in response to developments in relation to human rights. Senator Evans certainly agreed with that, because some time ago he said:

        But not this Prime Minister! He does not think that there should be any link. That is an awkward message to get across, particularly in the circumstances in which we find ourselves with Indonesia. The Opposition currently supports the level of aid and does not in any sense argue that we should change the level of aid, but we reserve our right to monitor developments in human rights. Against that background, I must say how pleased we have been that the Indonesian Government's assessment of the Dili massacre has been a very credible one. Indonesia's response has been a very credible one, and I think, to be fair, it is probably better than many people would have expected. In that sense I think it is very important that we continue to give Indonesia encouragement to meet those international standards of human rights and to satisfy the rest of the world that it is cognisant of the importance of that issue in terms of dealing with incidents such as those that occurred recently in the case of the Dili massacre.

         There are five major reasons already why the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia was a monumental failure. A final reason is this proposal of his to have a regional heads of government meeting. It is a good proposal and we would support it, but we would not give it a lot of priority. Nor did President Suharto. Despite the Prime Minister's claim in his speech today, I would say that, at best, President Suharto gave it lukewarm endorsement; he did not see it as a priority. The Prime Minister also quoted a letter from President Bush in support of the idea. I would like to see that letter. I bet President Bush also did not think it was a priority.

         There is so much that can be done within the existing framework of APEC as an institutional structure. We could give it teeth, for example, and pursue a genuine objective of trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific region. In that sense we could use the existing structures. I am not playing down the fact that at some time down the track we might have a heads of government meeting on a regional basis, but there is so much more that needs to be done, particularly given the magnitude of the economic circumstances of the time in our region. That can be done within the existing institutional framework of APEC.

         Finally, the Prime Minister commented on his visit to Papua New Guinea. I, too, was pleased to be there at the same time as the Prime Minister and to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the New Guinea campaigns of the Second World War and, importantly, to reaffirm our commitment to the importance of the Australia-Papua New Guinea relationship. I spent a day with Prime Minister Namaliu visiting his local political constituency and, as part of that, I visited the Bita Paka War Cemetery near Rabaul, where so many Australians died. I also visited parts of the Kokoda track. I walked just a few hundred yards of that track, almost continuously in a vertical direction, and I am told that at one time even the television cameras picked up the fact that I disappeared off the screen. People can read all the books they like and they can see all the movies they like, but when they stand there and see how rough that terrain is, when they realise that an enemy could be five or 10 feet away yet they cannot even see him or have any idea that he is there, and when they see the afternoon rains wash down those areas and sweep away any work that they thought they may have achieved in the morning, they understand the magnitude of the sacrifice that those men made on our behalf.

         What perhaps offended me more than anything else was that, in the midst of the commemoration of events in Papua New Guinea 50 years ago, the Prime Minister went up to a small child who had gone to the trouble of making his own version of the Australian flag, looked down and said, `I will give you a new one of those soon'. That showed the most amazing sense of hypocrisy and was most insulting to the Australians who fought under that flag and who died under that flag. And the Prime Minister claims he has a sense of direction for this country? He does not even know where to begin!

         Let me just take one piece of nonsense that he came up with. He missed the whole pointâ€”the whole pointâ€”of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was saying about the sacrifice of our soldiers on the Kokoda Trail. Like most Australians, relatives of mineâ€”actually, as it turns out, a relative I never could have known as I was born after the warâ€”participated in that campaign. One of my uncles was taken prisoner and subsequently killed in the aftermath of a submarine attack on the transport vessel on which he was being taken back to Japan. The Leader of the Opposition is not unusual in having had that experience. He ain't Robinson Crusoe in this place or anywhere else.

         What the Prime Minister specifically referred to about thisâ€”and I must say, as a person who once earned a living as a political historian, I am enormously gratified that at last history is being brought front and centre into the way in which we define ourselves as a nationâ€”in that speech that he made on the Kokoda Trail was the sacrifice of Australians in all theatres. He did not differentiate between those who died on the Kokoda Trail, those who died as a result of actions in Papua New Guinea or the Papua New Guinean campaign, and the death of an Australian soldier in Gallipoli, the Middle East or anywhere else.

         He said that Australians have to get to grips with their strategic geography and understand what was important for us, not just in terms of defending general values of democracy, which of course we were committed to in dealing with the Nazi threatâ€”those who fought against the Germans in the Middle Eastâ€”but also in dealing with the issues of what was strategically significant to us. In fact, in the 1940s people like Curtin had a hell of a battle to get a focus in our region, to get a focus for equipment, to get a focus for personnel.

         I cannot absolutely verify this, but I do think it to be true, having got it from somebody who has made a speciality of this campaign: it was not until the middle of 1943 that General MacArthur had more American troops under his command than Australian troops. Australians fought very hard diplomatically in that period to get themselves in a position whereby we could survive. In one sense it was a perfectly reasonable judgment by Churchill and by leaders in the United Statesâ€”because it was not particularly a British viewâ€”if they were simply looking at the tactics of the situation, that whether Australia went or survived was not that important. There were many in the United States Navy who advocated that they should go into Japan head-on and not bother about island-hopping. In those circumstances, Australia was irrelevant.

         The judgment could be arrived at by a man terribly embattled and embroiled with his major threat in Europeâ€”the Nazi threatâ€”that that was where his efforts should be concentrated. I do not denigrate Churchill for having arrived at those conclusions and I do not denigrate the Americans who supported him for having arrived at those conclusions; in their eyes it was perfectly reasonable. When we look at the history of the twenties and thirties, for which Churchill was not responsible, in which the British Navy was rendered impotent in the Far East, totally impotent, and certainly impotent in circumstances where it had to confront a war on a multiplicity of fronts, we see that it is reasonable that he decided, having confronted those facts with the material that he had to hand, to deal with the situation that was there in Europe.

         It is fine for other people to make judgments. But there were seven million of us living here, and those who were occupied elsewhere in the region in the course of that conflict received very short shrift indeed. The Government of the day, those soldiers along the Kokoda Trail and those seamen out in the Battle of the Coral Sea had to make a standâ€”denuded of a considerable amount of help from the people of their own country who were away fighting in the Middle Eastâ€”almost on their own for a very long period. It was a strategic decision, not one about the equality of sacrifice between a soldier in the 9th Division who died in the Middle East at the battle of El Alamein, and a soldier who died on the Kokoda Trail. That is not the point. The point is that there is a strategic lesson to be learned from thatâ€”and it is darned difficult to get into the heads of Australians that they ought to learn it.

         So the Opposition Leader, as has been the case with Liberals so often in the past, debauched that feature of the debate with his sleight of hand. He then went on to say in his arguments that as far as the initiative towards Indonesia was concernedâ€”moving away from Papua New Guineaâ€”this was no break with the past. It is true that there have been visits by Australian statesmen to Indonesia in years past; there is nothing particularly exceptional about that. What was exceptional was not what the Prime Minister had to say about himself or what the Australian media had to say about the Prime Ministerâ€”that had been said by Prime Ministers about themselves and by members of the media about Australian Prime Ministers in the pastâ€”but what the Indonesians said about the Prime Minister and about us and what they believed the visit constituted.

         The Leader of the House also reflected on the comments in respect of the Kokoda Trail. I want to say to the Prime Minister that I welcome that part of his statement where he affirmed that the Government is going to increase the provision of funds to provide an upgrading of rest facilities along the Kokoda Trail and increase the funds for the local war museum and related village developments and facilities. I think all members on both sides of the House regard the Kokoda Trail as very much part of the heritage of the region and of Papua New Guinea in the first place, and very much part of the Australian military heritage. I also welcome the announcement by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that it is going to receive a heritage listing. In rebutting the Minister on this particular point, I can do no better than quote the article in which our Prime Minister said:

       <para>
        That is a judgmental matter which, of course, then led the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), not a member of the Opposition, to make the point that the Prime Minister was one who was putting an added premium on the activity in Papua New Guinea. It is true that the Prime Minister did go on to mention all the conflicts in which Australians were involved, and I readily concede that. But I pick up on what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, because he made a valid point when he said that if the African campaign, for argument's sake, had been lost then indeed all associated with World War II would have been lost. Of course there was linkage across all the battles in which Australians were associated. It is opening up a very awkward area to suggest that there are degrees of importance and difficulty associated with the commitment of troops and the activity of Australian troops overseas. It is a point that I think the Prime Minister might now regret that he raised in the context of this debate.

         Finally, in terms of the Minister's comments, he decided to describe Professor Blainey as `the Opposition's dancing professor'. The professor is a man of letters well recognised. He does not even need me to attest to his capability, his statesmanship or his accuracy as a professor of history and related matters. I want to say right here and now that the professor on many occasions has pointed the way ahead for Australia on many key issues, and he has a right to speak up. His utterances should be well regarded and very carefully considered because they make a great deal of sense.

         â€”He is indeed a man of vision, and one whom I readily acknowledge. I return to why we had the statement from the Prime Minister in the first place. This is a very interesting question. Honourable members might remember that last week the Prime Minister, in a casual and cavalier way, decided to take a dorothy dixer from the Government to try to get away with a cheap prime ministerial statement on his overseas trip by responding simply to a question without notice. We were quick to highlight that that was an inadequate approach, one which breached convention and one which, of course, is likely to give offence indeed to some of our Asian friends.

         I understand that the actions that we took, and perhaps some feedback from elsewhere, have now resulted finally, on this last day of sitting of this current fortnight period, in the Prime Minister creeping back into this House and giving the statement that he should have given in the proper way last week shortly after his return. I say of his statement in respect of his first trip overseas as Prime Minister what Harold Macmillan said:

        The tragedy is that the Prime Minister acted as a Prime Minister overseas and in a very divisive way. It has to be said that his position is one of a wrecker, a destroyer, and one which is all about dividing this nation at a time when we need maximum empathy and maximum cohesion to deal with the problems which face Australia. The Prime Minister has not laid a glove on the Fightback package in real terms, and he has also gone on to indicate that his knowledge of foreign affairs, particularly Asia, could be written on a postage stamp, with room left over.

         I must say that the Prime Minister comes into this House and dishes out the rhetoric time and time again, but when we get down to examining his record we find that it is an inadequate record so far as Asia is concerned. The acid test was in the nine years that the Prime Minister was a frontbencher. Did he go to one ASEAN country? The answer is no. He made not one working visit to one ASEAN country. That is an utter disgrace for a senior frontbencher. Did he go to Europe, to London, to Russia, to France in particular? Of course, he went many times; in fact some eight to 11 times he was to be found in the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe and the United States.

Compare that with any attempt to go to south Asia, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh or Burma, as I have been. Compare that, of course, with his one visit to China. Why did he go to China?

         The one thing we learn in making annual working visits to Asia is that the Asians are quick to recognise a Johnny-come-lately and someone who is less than sincere in his attitude and approach to developing relations with Asia. The one thing Asians like least of all are short term, opportunistic visitors, especially when they have had the opportunity, the resources and the capability to have been more regular visitors to Asia in their most recent past and in the various positions they have held in the past. The Prime Minister has been caught out in terms of his sudden adoption of the Asian way, the Asian direction.

         Of course, the Asian direction is a legitimate direction for Australia. The Liberal and National parties have made very clear, ahead of time, our commitment to building up those working relations between Asia and Australia. Of course we will continue to do that. As Leader of the National Party I have gone out of my way each year, particularly in the month of January, to make working visits to a range of Asian countries; in fact, to some 18 different Asian countries. I have been to all of them except Sri Lanka and Pakistan. That is not for the want of trying, but of course the time available to make those visits is always difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, I will try to rectify that as soon as I can.

I recognise that that is where there is so much rich potential for trading opportunities for our primary industries.

         There has to be an absolute acceptance on a bipartisan basis that Australia is in for the long haul with Asia. We have to put depth into our relationship between Australia and Asia. On the one hand, for example, between Australia and Indonesia, that is manifested by things such as the Timor Gap treaty which is going to allow for detailed exploration of some very interesting kelp structures between Australia and Indonesia. On the other hand, it goes beyond the commercial to the political, the diplomatic and the military cooperation which should exist between Australia and Asia.

That is often lost on elements, even of my own constituency, who would argue that in this time of horrific recession we should eliminate all foreign aid. I reject that argument, because it is as a consequence of the efforts that Australia has made in Asia, in part the foreign aid under the previous coalition government and this Government, that we have seen the standard of living of places such as South Korea rise to such a level that they are now buying Australian wheat, whereas they never before bought Australian wheat.

         That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwithâ€”That the Prime Minister be required to give a full explanation to this House of Senator Richardson's involvement in the affairs of Mr Greg Symons in relation to the Marshall Islands and to explain why he has not stood down Senator Richardson from the Cabinet for misleading the Senate.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Today in the Senate we had a clear demonstration of the fact that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, misled the Senate over the nature of his activities in relation to the Marshall Islands and his relative Mr Greg Symons, who is on something like 11 charges of forgery in the Marshall Islands. To be clear at the outset, as I want to establish the urgency of this debate, I want to put on the record the two particular instances which clearly demonstrate the extent to which Senator Richardson has misled the House.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I go back to 29 April 1992, when Senator Richardson was asked a question by Senator Kemp on the basis of some newspaper reports about the activities of Mr Symons and his business affairs in the Marshall Islands. He asked Senator Richardson to provide details of his knowledge of Mr Symons's business affairs. Senator Richardson said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         My recollection is, yes, I provided a number of details that had been provided to me by Mr Symons.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, in relation to a reference that he gave Mr Symons. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I repeat the statementâ€”
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, a statement that he had made previously to the pressâ€”
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        that I have no knowledge of his business affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Hill then interjected, saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But you put in a letter of introduction.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No, that was said in the context of whatever business it is in which he is involved, over which he has been charged. I made the point that I had no knowledge of that business and I repeat it now.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there is a clear-cut statement on 29 April that Senator Richardson had no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Greg Symons in relation to his activities in the Marshall Islands, for which he was charged, even though he had written a reference for Mr Symons in June 1991 in relation to his intention to develop business interests in the Marshall Islands.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Then today, again under the questioning of Senator Hill, Senator Richardson gave a completely different answer. He was asked:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is it a fact that on or about 12 November 1991 you met with Mr Greg Symons, Mr Patrick Chen, Vice President and Manager of the International Department of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands, and a lawyer? If so, what was the purpose of the meeting? What was discussed? Were Mr Symons's business interests discussed at this meeting?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson went said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No. I think Mr Symons and Mr Finch did come; I do not think Mr Chen made it. He had not arrived at the time that they came to my office, so I did not meet him.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then he went on with the crucial point:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . I have spoken to Mr Symons and Mr Finch, so I did know that they had a scheme going which was a business migration scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        So here today in the Senate we have a clear contradiction of the earlier answer given in the Senate on 29 April. On the first occasion, Senator Richardson said he did not know; on the second occasion Senator Richardson said that he did know, but it was about a business migration scheme. But subsequent questioning today in the Senate has revealed an attempt by Senator Richardson to stonewall on that point and he did not provide any additional information. I think in response to one other question he said he was not sure of the details of the plan.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is an incident that has been the subject of continuous cross-questioning by us in the Senate and in this House about Senator Richardson's activities as a Minister and whether he used his position as a Minister in relation to the Marshall Islands. That was in the earlier set of questions. He telephoned the President of the Marshall Islands, which he claimed, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accepted, was done in a private capacity. Now, of course, today we see a direct contradiction of his position of 29 April. Originally he said that he did not know anything about the business interests and today, of course, he suddenly remembered that he did know that it was a business migration scheme.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Finally, in a question, he was asked what he had been asked about and he said that it was whether he knew anybody in the State Department of the United States. That obviously had a particular role to play in this scheme.
         </tab>
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I understand the schemeâ€”and it is only what I have pieced togetherâ€”it involves the sale of passports to Chinese nationals, mostly Hong Kong nationals, in the Marshall Islands, which in effect, it is hoped, gives them access to the United States by a back door. That is a very lucrative business which, in some press reports today, has been described by the Chief Justice of the Marshall Islands as an activity that involves, in his words, `a tremendous amount of money'.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Richardson's particular involvement goes back initially to the phone call he made. He argued that he did not use his position in relation to that phone call. Honourable members can just imagine this phone call taking place. There is a bit of inconsistency here. On some occasions, he sort of admits that he did say it was Senator Richardson speaking and, apparentlyâ€”as was said in today's pressâ€”it was known at the time that he was the Minister for Social Security, but he says that he did not use his position in relation to the Marshall Islands. Honourable members can just imagine the phone call coming in: `This is Senator Richardsonâ€”S-E-N-A-T-O-Râ€”Minister for Social Security in Australia'. And this is to a country of about 45,000 people.

         â€”The notorious numbers cruncherâ€”to use that expressionâ€”of the Australian Government rings up, though he was not doing it in anything but a private capacity; he was not using his position. As we saw in today's press, there was clearly an understanding on the part of those in the Marshall Islands that Senator Richardson had used his position. In the debate about bail which took place earlier this month, it was interesting that the Attorney-General, Mr Denis McPhillips, described Senator Richardson as `a Minister of great power'. He concluded that without knowing anything beyond the fact that Senator Richardson was just a citizen of Australia calling on behalf of his relative.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that it would be most interesting to go through some of these statements. The debate was about how much bail there should be for Senator Richardsonâ€”I am sorry, I am a bit ahead of myself; how much bail should be set for Mr Symons in the Marshall Islands. The Attorney-General has taken the view that about $US1 1/4m would cover any damage that would be done if Mr Symons did not come back. In his arguments before the court in setting that bail, Mr McPhillips told Chief Justice Neil Rutledge:

         We do fear that, due to the influential friends in Australia that Mr Symons has, he may not return.

        `Influential friends in Australia'. He continued:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We may not be able to gather his return. As you see, I've just handed you a fax which is the introduction of Gregory Symons from the Minister of Social Security in Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        We thought that there was a letter, but there was also a fax. We do not know where the fax came from, but it is from the Minister for Social Security in Canberra. Mr McPhillips went on:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This was an introductory document to the Republic. It is my understanding this particular Minister is one of the most powerful ministers in the Australian Government. He wields great power . . . not just another Minister, not just an opposition party member, but part of the government. Knowing this, even more doubt has to be cast on the ability of the republic to retrieve Mr Symons should he not live up to the waiver of extradition or should we have to attempt to extradite with Australia, although we have no expedition treaty.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Attorney-General was taking the view that Senator Richardson had used his position. Senator Richardson said that he knew nothing about the business activities of Mr Symons, but it is interesting to look at the reference Senator Richardson gave Mr Symons. He seemed to have had a reasonable idea of some of those business activities when he gave this reference to Mr Symons earlier on. It states:

We were led to believe that his was a fraternal call and was nothing more than the helping out of a relative of his wife. Who other than the mean minded on this side of the House would call that side of the activity into question? We now find, under questioning from usâ€”not from his admissionâ€”that on 12 November Senator Richardson had a meeting with Mr Symons, and he had a meeting with Mr Symons's lawyer. If it were such a casual, family, fraternal call, what was Mr Symons's lawyer doing there?

         On top of that, a Mr Patrick Chen was supposed to have been at the meeting. Mr Patrick Chen is the Vice-President of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands.

I ask another rhetorical question: what on earth was the Minister for Social Security doing meeting a relative and the relative's lawyer, and being prepared to meet the Vice-President of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands?

         Senator Richardson then tells the Parliament that he knows nothing about the business affairs of his relative. Then, under questioning from the Opposition, and not as an act of ministerial contrition and coming clean we heard his story. If he had come into the Parliament and said, `Look, I have really stuffed this one up; I did not give a full account of it and here is the full story', perhaps we on this side of the Parliament may have a different attitude. But he played fast and loose with the truth and he has been caught out. There is no man who plays the politics of toughness and hardness in a more brazen fashion than Senator Richardson. He is a legendary member of the `mates', and they operate on the basis of never apologising and never resigning.

         That is the short and simple point. The Australian people will judge this Prime Minister on the standard of probity that he is prepared to defend. The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on Ministers observing the basic requirement of a Minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth. Senator Richardson has failed to do this. The Prime Minister ought to be in here explaining Senator Richardson's lapse. Better still, he ought to be hopping in the car, going out to Yarralumla and withdrawing Senator Richardson's commission. It is with great pleasure that I second the motion.

         Having made that point, I want to go into an exercise related to allegations being raised by the Opposition as the reasons why Standing Orders ought to be suspended. We have had a lot of experience in recent days of selective quoting by the Opposition; for example, the selective quoting of Treasury documents, which was dealt with by the Secretary to the Treasury so adequately today when he talked about its models as garbage in and garbage out. In this case, it is selective quotes from Senator Richardson's explanation in the Senate. The points on this are very simple.

         The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) bases his claim on Senator Richardson saying that he had no knowledge of the business interests of Mr Symons after Mr Symons had visited him or whilst Mr Symons was in the situation in which he was in the Marshall Islands, and subsequently that he knew Mr Symons was involved with business migration. If we look at what Senator Richardson says, the explanation becomes pretty obvious. This is the quote the Liberal Party spokesmen have used today:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very different proposition from saying that he had no knowledge of Mr Symons's business. What he said in completing that answer before he was heckled was that he had no knowledge of the business in the sense of that business for which he is charged. That is a very different situation.

         To know that somebody in this country runs a business migration business does not necessarily mean that one knows that he is conducting activities which lead to a charge in the Marshall Islands and that he is running a business migration program in the United States, allegedly selling passports, or whatever, for people to go through the Marshall Islands into the United States. Knowing that somebody, generically, is involved in the notion of business migration does not mean that one necessarily knows the details of that business. What Senator Richardson made absolutely clear from that, and again in his explanation to the Senate today, was that he had no knowledge of the business that was being conducted by Symons which left Symons in a position in which he was subject to charges of fraud.

That is of a piece with what Senator Richardson happened to tell the Senate at the time: it was a telephone call without pressure; he was simply making a case that the fellow ought to be allowed to return home in order to defend himself and then get himself back to the Marshall Islands.

         He was on record as saying that he did not find that particularly offensive or was allegedly pressured in that direction. As far as he was concerned, it had no influence on him whatsoever. Subsequently, he said, `You ought not to deal with this fellow in any way other than keeping him here, because this senator in Australia has, as far as he is concerned, an enormous amount of influence'. That sounds like new knowledge on the part of the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands, gained between when he heard about phone calls in regard to Mr Symons's business and when he subsequently had Mr Symons in court. The fact that he had a bit of new knowledge in that period of time is not germane to his original response and nothing which this House needs to trouble itself with.

         â€”by leaveâ€”This report concerns the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). The background is that on 4 October 1991 the honourable member wrote to the then Minister for Social Security on behalf of a constituent, a Mr Radisich, and, amongst other things, the honourable member's letter referred critically to a named public servant.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On 18 February the honourable member received by fax a letter dated 13 February from a firm of solicitors, Dwyer and Co., which advised that it was acting for the public servant in question. The solicitors' letter concluded with the statement:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, our client requires a written apology from you together with a clarification to be sent to both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training within seven days, failing which we are instructed to commence proceedings for libel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee received written submissions from the honourable member for Aston and from the solicitors involved. On receipt of a detailed submission from the honourable member for Aston, the Committee sent this to Dwyer and Co., inviting any further submission the firm wished to make. The Committee subsequently received an additional written submission from Dwyer and Co..

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The honourable member for Aston advised the Committee in his submission that he felt, at the time he received the letter from Dwyer and Co., that he was being pressured both by way of the short time scale to respond, and the implication of threatened legal action with its resultant publicity, to withdraw his representations on behalf of his constituent. The honourable member asserted that he had a right and a duty to correspond with Ministers on matters affecting his constituents.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In its submissions, Dwyer and Co. explained its actions, outlining the background to its involvement on behalf of its client and commenting on the honourable member for Aston's letter, which gave rise to its involvement. The Committee gave careful consideration to all the material before it and received a detailed memorandum on the matter.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee takes the view that members should, in their correspondence with Ministers, distinguish clearly between occasions when they are putting forward their own view and those occasions when they are relaying the views of a constituent. The Committee recognises that in such cases there are competing proper interests. Members and the constituents they represent have an interest in the capacity of members to be able to make representations to Ministers without the threat of actions for defamation.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On the other hand, the Committee accepts the proposition that citizens have a basic right to protect their reputations and, if necessary, to have recourse to the courts of law. As a general rule, the Committee believes that the threat to commence proceedings against a member in respect of a letter written to a Minister on behalf of a constituent could be held to constitute improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the present case, although the person or persons responsible for the letter from Dwyer and Co. to the honourable member for Aston may have acted without a full knowledge of the legal and related issues involved and although the person or persons may not have intended to intimidate or influence the honourable member for Aston in an improper way, the terms of the letter and the circumstances of its receipt, in the opinion of the Committee, had a tendency to impair the honourable member for Aston's independence in the performance of his duties.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I should add that the Committee is of the view that, in writing letters to Ministers on behalf of constituents, members should not be immune from the laws of defamation. Such an extension of absolute privilege would not be warranted. Nevertheless, the Committee believes that the House's ability to act in respect of a particular threat of obstruction, or obstruction, is important if members are to perform the work expected of them. I ask for leave to move that the House take note of the report.

         The extension of benefits in respect of service in Cambodia follows the Government's decision of 9 October 1991 to deploy Australian Defence Force personnel for service in Cambodia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Bill will designate Cambodia as an operational area from 20 October 1991. This is the date, confirmed by the Department of Defence, on which Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed for service in the area. It will remain an `operational area' until the United Nations ceasefire takes effect, and related demobilisation and cantonment measures are in place. After that time, service in Cambodia will be designated as `peacekeeping service'.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A further amendment to the legislation will be necessary to close off the period of operational service in Cambodia.

These changes will take place after the United Nations ceasefire.

        The Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to the Government's commitment to integrate family payments for children. The integration of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit will result in a program of nearly $2 billion which will assist about 800,000 families or nearly 1 1/2 million children. As well, family allowance and family allowance supplement will be amalgamated into a single payment with entitlement calculated under a two-step income and assets test.

         Under current arrangements, family allowance is payable to a one-child family with a combined income of $64,167 per annum and full rate family allowance supplement is payable where combined income is $20,700 or less. Both are subject to an assets test based on net market value; $359,250 for family allowance supplement and $600,000 for family allowance with special provisions available for families with high net assets in hardship. The total number of families assisted under the whole family payment program will be in the vicinity of 1.9 million, or nearly four million children.

         The new family payment is a major reform which derives from the social security review.

         Poverty traps occur where recipients of income support perceive that they have little financial incentive for increasing income from earnings. In a period when unemployment is higher than we would all like, it is critically important to do everything we can to encourage work force participation. Currently, pensioners and beneficiaries may compare their financial situation while receiving social security with employment at a relatively low wage or salary and, because they are unaware of their likely qualification for family allowance supplement to top up their earnings, think that they will be no better off if they take work.

         The measures in this Bill will make the choices between government assistance and work much clearer and will signal to pensioners and beneficiaries that assistance for their families will, in all likelihood, continue if they take a job with a low to moderate wage. When a person leaves income support he or she, if income support was received for 12 months or more, will automatically be sent a family payment claim form and will be given six weeks within which to claim the payment. Shorter term recipients will also be told how to get extra payments. This will give people every opportunity to test themselves for eligibility for the additional family payment. If they lodge their claim within the six weeks, full arrears of additional family payment will be made back to the time they ceased their pension, benefit or allowance.

         One major effect of these reforms is that the new family payment will direct a greater proportion of the family's social security support to the person responsible for the day-to-day care of children, usually the mother. For example, in a family with two children under 13 where the father receives Job Search allowance, under the new family payment arrangements the mother will receive $163 a fortnight instead of the $41.40 she currently receives.

         Family allowance supplement payments are now directed to the mother in most cases, as are the payments of additional pension for children of pensioner couples. The changes in this Bill will apply the same principle to child related payments for families receiving Job Search allowance or other income support payments. Directing payments for children to the primary care giver is consistent with the Government's social justice strategy and the national agenda for women.

         The family payment will be paid on what are currently family allowance paydays. These fortnightly paydays fall on the alternate Thursday to pension paydays. Spreading pensioners' payments more evenly through a fortnight will assist family budgeting. To give another example, a sole parent pensioner with two children under 13 currently receives $461.60 each fortnight on the Thursday pension payday and $41.40 in family allowance in the following week, giving total assistance of $503 per fortnight.

Rent assistance will also be included in the family payment for those families with children eligible for additional family payment who pay private rent.

         I must stress that total financial support provided to the family from social security will not be reduced under the changes to payment arrangements. At present sole parents who receive family allowance supplement do not receive guardian allowance, whereas sole parent pensioners do. Under the new family payment this anomaly will be addressed and all sole parents who qualify for additional family payment will receive the guardian allowance. At the moment, guardian allowance is $746.20 a year or $28.70 a fortnight. Paying guardian allowance to eligible working sole parents will deal with a potential poverty trap for this group.

         Maintenance income is currently taken into account in determining the rate of pension or benefit. Under the new arrangements, maintenance payments will only be taken into account in determining the rate of the additional family payment.

         Family allowance supplement recipients are currently not subject to the maintenance income test. However, from 1 January 1993 all persons qualified for additional family payment will have maintenance taken into account. Although this means that some recipients will receive a lower rate of additional family payment, it will result in a more consistent treatment of people in receipt of maintenance. As I mentioned earlier, guardian allowance will be paid to all sole parent additional family payment recipients, and the additional $746.20 a year will largely offset the impact of the maintenance income test for a very substantial group.

This measure encourages families to allow their children to complete education and overcomes an existing anomaly whereby some families receive family allowance for children aged under 18 throughout year 12 while others with children who turn 18 at some time during the year cease eligibility at that time. As at present, students aged 16 years or more will not attract the payment if they are eligible for Austudy.

I remind honourable members that such payments are free of income tax. The increase in the FAS threshold from April 1992, together with the introduction of the new, single, two-step program, is estimated to lead to an additional 90,000 families receiving additional family payments.

         I mentioned the assets test earlier. Honourable members will recall that, from the beginning of 1992, this Government introduced a hardship test as part of each assets test applicable to family allowance and family allowance supplement. In the prevailing economic circumstances, especially the rural downturn, there are concerns about the welfare of children in families with assets above the family allowance supplement assets test threshold, but where those assets are returning very low incomes. Honourable members will be pleased that the new family payment system preserves the hardship tests for both the basic and additional family payments to protect the families concerned.

         In respect of local roads funds, the Special Premiers Conference of October 1990 decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to local government or to State Governments where they are responsible for local roads, via general purpose grants. The Government decided to introduce interim arrangements for 1991-92 to provide a period of stability while the detailed arrangements were finalised for subsequent years. The interim arrangements were reflected in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Act 1991.

This change will extend identified local road funding to an additional 52 local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, the great majority of which represent Aboriginal communities. This change will be achieved by providing for a mechanism to transfer some local roads funds, currently paid to the Territory Government, to Northern Territory local governments via the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The Act provides Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for the provision of higher education. This Bill provides increased funding for higher education institutions of $46.7m in 1992, $29.7m in 1993 and $9.5m in 1994.

Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries.

         The present commercial tariff concession system allows duty-free entry of imports where there are no goods serving similar functions made by Australian industry in the normal course of business. The objective of the system is to ensure that industry is not taxed by the tariff where it is serving no protective function. By lowering input costs, the concession system is an important element in the Government's program to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry. Once a commercial tariff concession order is in place, any importer can use it to import goods described in that order duty-free.

         The present commercial tariff concession system was introduced in 1983, following an IAC report in 1982. The March 1991 Industry Commission inquiry and report to which this Bill is addressed has been prompted by a growing dissatisfaction with the operation of the current system, particularly with the time taken to obtain a concession order, and the lack of transparency in the decision making process leading to the grant or refusal of such an order.

       </para>
       <para>
        .The first introduces new definitions for the current core criteria for the granting of a tariff concession order to replace the old `goods serving similar functions' test, which incorporated the economic concept of `cross-elasticity of demand', which has proven difficult to interpret and administer,
       </para>
       <para>
        .The second introduces strict time limits both on the processing of applications or revocations by the bureaucracy, and on the submission of information by affected parties. This will streamline the consideration of applications for tariff concession orders or revocations of such orders, and help make the process more transparent,
       </para>

       <para>
        With respect to this final principal reform, it is noted that the current concession system allows persons aggrieved by a decision under part XVA to obtain judicial review of that decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This is both costly and time consuming and, importantly, limited to errors of law.

         The proposed anti-dumping amendments in this Bill follow the Government's review of Australia's anti-dumping policy and administrative arrangements in late 1991. Dumping and subsidisation are not supported internationally if they cause, or threaten to cause, material injury to an industry producing like goods in the importing country. The internationally agreed remedy is the imposition of a dumping or countervailing duty sufficient to remove the injury to the local industry.

         The Government has consistently maintained that effective anti-dumping and countervailing measures are necessary to protect Australian industry from injury caused by these unfair trading practices. However, in taking anti-dumping and countervailing actions there is need to strike a balance, a balance between providing local producers with effective relief and ensuring that relief does not unjustifiably impede trade or increase costs to Australian consumers. Anti-dumping decisions therefore require judgments to be made involving a blend of economic and commercial considerations. Over the last two years the Government has particularly focused on the time taken to process applications for anti-dumping and countervailing action. The Government looked exhaustively at the options for reducing the time between a request for anti-dumping relief and the time when such relief can first be made available.

         In the 1991 March industry statement the Government proposed and the Parliament subsequently passed legislation which greatly reduced the processing time for applications. Clause 13 of this Bill will further shorten the total time allowed to reach a preliminary finding to a maximum of 125 days or, for complex cases, a maximum of 145 days. This compares more than favourably to the times taken by other countries in the processing of requests for anti-dumping relief. Australia now has one of the fastest anti-dumping systems. The USA, for instance, takes between 160 and 210 days; Canada between 141 and 186 days; and the European Community around 270 days. I seek leave to incorporate in

         In addition to this extension, clause 7 then provides for a review to be undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority as to whether measures should continue after the five-year expiry date for measures or undertakings, following a request for such a review by an interested party. The Authority will call for submissions no later than eight months before this expiry date so as to allow sufficient time for a comprehensive inquiry to be made by the Authorityâ€”and a decision to be made by the Ministerâ€”before the end of the five-year period.

         Measures will be retained where the Minister is satisfied that they are requiredâ€”but they may not necessarily be of the same type or magnitude. For example, if earlier measures were in the form of an undertaking, they might, depending on the circumstances, be replaced by anti-dumping duties. Similarly, earlier measures based on prices in the country of export may need to be revised to reflect prices which are more current. This reform is considered by the Government to be preferable to requiring an Australian industry to re-apply for anti-dumping or countervailing relief, with the possibility of a gap occurring in the important relief which might be available.

During the course of its review, the Government considered claims of duplication of work by the Customs Service and the ADA, but it is satisfied that the current division of responsibilities between these two bodies should be retained, to ensure the comprehensive and impartial review of anti-dumping measures that is currently provided by the Authority.

         Part 2 of this Bill makes a number of amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986. The amendments to part II of this Act are part of a new strategy to assist Commonwealth funded organisations improve the standard of service they provide for people with a disability. The primary focus of the amendments is on providing people with the services which best meet their needs and aspirations, and to ensure that the quality of these services is subject to safeguards.

         The Disability Services Act came into operation in 1987. It provided all the then funded services, called prescribed services, with five years to meet the higher standards of service embodied in the objects, which are contained in section 3 of the Act, and principles and objectives made under section 5 of the Act and gazetted on 9 June 1987. This five-year period ends on 30 June 1992.

         Although significant achievements have been made, it has become clear that for many services this five-year period was not long enough to deal with the complexity of the changes required. Therefore, the Bill provides for ongoing funding to prescribed services so that they can complete the necessary changes enabling them to further the objects of the Act, and the gazetted principles and objectives.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To be assured of ongoing funding, services will have to meet prescribed minimum standards. The minimum standards were introduced administratively in February 1991 and all services are expected to meet these standards by 30 June 1992. Ultimately, all funded organisations will be required to become eligible for funding under section 10 of the Act, by providing a service at a standard consistent with the objectives of the Act, and the gazetted principles and objectives.

         However, to give recognition and assistance to those organisations who are continually and substantially improving their services, but who have not reached the standard for eligibility for funding under section 10, the Bill establishes an intermediate level of service standard and attainment. To reflect their progress and transition on the path to higher service standards, these services will be called transitional services. The Bill provides for the Minister to determine clear and objective standards which services will be expected to meet. Where a service fails to meet the applicable standards the Minister will be able to take action under the terms and conditions contained in the funding agreement; however, this action will be subject to a review by a disability standards review panel. The amendments provide that the performance of funded services against the applicable standards is assessed at least once every five years.

The Bill contains provisions to allow State and Territory government employment services which are transferring to the Commonwealth, but which are not yet furthering the objects of the Act, or the gazetted principles and objectives, to be funded as prescribed services under section 13.

Nursing home residents already are able to leave the nursing home for up to 28 days a year without any reduction of nursing home benefits paid to the nursing home. In the case of residents having to go to hospital, there is no limit to the number of days leave during which benefits will still be paid. This entitlement to 28 days non-hospital leave is now being extended to allow for up to two days of leave to be taken before the resident actually enters the nursing home.

Under the existing legislation, no Commonwealth benefit is payable until a person occupies a place in a nursing home.

Commonwealth benefits are advanced to proprietors each month and, following the end of each financial year, that advanced benefit is acquitted against the proprietor's actual expenditure on nursing and personal care.  Where a proprietor has spent less on nursing and personal care than has been advanced, the balance is recovered. This is frequently the case.

         What this means is that it is possible for a proprietor to underspend benefit and sell his or her nursing home before the overpayment can be identified, let alone recovered. Once the home is sold, the Department is able to quantify the overpayment. However, the current legislation makes the new proprietor liable for recovery of the previous proprietor's overadvance.

         This process is well established and known in the industry, and is usually accounted for in contracts for sale of nursing homes. However, the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 prevent the disclosure by the Department of information relating to a nursing home to a prospective purchaser. While prospective purchasers may appreciate the possibility of a recovery subsequent to sale, without specific information as to current and impending recoveries, they may be unable to adequately make provision in the contract of sale. They may, as a consequence, be significantly disadvantaged by underestimating the amount of the recovery. This may place some strain on the home's financing, making it harder for the new proprietor to provide quality care to the residents.

         The Bill contains amendments to assist in protecting the incoming proprietor and ensuring continued quality care for residents by allowing the Department to provide the prospective purchaser with the information he or she needs to make an informed decision about a sale. The rights of existing proprietors are also considered, as the Department will be required to wait seven days before disclosing information, during which time the proprietor may make a submission on the matter for consideration. In situations where there is an urgent need to act to protect the interests of a prospective purchaser, however, the Department will be able to act immediately. The elimination of this risk in the purchase of a nursing home will promote confidence in the transaction, stability in financing and continued quality of care for residents.

         The third measure in this part of the Bill relates to the keeping of certain records by former proprietors of nursing homes. A further consequence of proprietors being able to sell their homes before an overpayment can be quantified is that, if the Department is unable to gain access to the proprietor's accounting records, it will be very difficult to quantify the overpayment accurately. While nursing home proprietors are subject to a number of statutory responsibilities in relation to the keeping of records, those responsibilities presently cease once the proprietor has sold his or her home.

         The fourth measure introduces amendments in relation to receivers, liquidators, et cetera, who are appointed to run a nursing home. The Bill amends the secrecy provision contained in the National Health Act 1953 to clarify the Department's ability to divulge key information to persons appointed to manage a proprietor's approved nursing home. Historically, there have been practical problems about how the secrecy provision should be administered where, for example, a receiver or a liquidator is appointed to conduct a proprietor's nursing home business. This has limited the Department's ability to deal effectively and cooperatively with such appointees, thus making it difficult for the Department to act in the interests of the nursing home residents.

         The final measure in part 7 of the Bill relates to transfers of nursing home bed approvals under section 39B of the Act. The Bill contains a measure to protect residents, where approved beds are to be transferred from one home to another. Approval in principle for such a transfer will be subject to a condition that the proprietor of the home yielding the beds continues to comply with nursing home conditions of approval. This is to further protect the welfare and safety of the residents in that home which will close or be reduced in size. The amendments will also provide for the formulation of principles to be referred to in making decisions to grant or refuse approvals in principle for transfers. These principles will address such matters as fraud or the provision of false or misleading information, failure to meet gazetted nursing home standards, and problems with any other statutory requirements. The effect will be that, where a person does not have a satisfactory record in the provision of aged care, that person will not be able to expand his or her interests in the industry by buying and transferring nursing home beds. This is a further example of the Government's commitment to ensuring quality care for the frail aged.

These amendments will operate retrospectively from 1 March 1992. Provision has been made, however, for the preservation of the effect of the benefit reduction, co-payment and `additional fee' for those prescribed services rendered during the period 1 December 1991 to 29 February 1992.

        This Bill contains a number of important policy initiatives aimed at increasing the control which the Government may exercise over Australia's migration program. In particular, the Bill contains significant measures to strengthen Australia's ability to cope with the increasing number of people claiming refugee status. Provisions have also been included to deter persons, primarily Indonesian nationals, from fishing illegally in Australian waters. The Bill also contains new powers to facilitate the successful operation of the Government's initiative to attract successful business migrants to Australia. Finally, the Bill will make a number of minor technical amendments to the Act.

         Over the past three years the number of applications for refugee status from persons wishing to remain in Australia has grown dramatically from below 500 applications per year to a current caseload of 22,500. Many of these applicants have been able to continue to delay their departure from Australia by deferring the lodgment of an actual application for refugee status. This is a cynical abuse of the refugee determination process, which will not be tolerated by the Government.

         Under the present policy based arrangements there are uncertainties about our ability to require applicants to cooperate in pursuing their claims in an expeditious manner. The Government has therefore decided to introduce a regulatory framework to underpin Australia's asylum determination procedures. The Government announced on 12 February 1992 that new arrangements would be introduced to improve the efficiency of Australia's system for processing claims for refugee status. The amendments set out in this Bill will facilitate refugee processing within a regulatory framework that provides certainty and accountability. The Bill will provide the Minister with a clear basis of power in the Act to make regulations for the orderly processing of refugee applications.

         The new measures developed to improve the refugee determination process will result in a more efficient and equitable system. Incorporating processing arrangements in regulations will produce a more predictable processing environment. All applicants have an equal opportunity to pursue their claims. The amendments in the Bill also relieve the Minister of the obligation to consider refugee applications by persons who hold the special four-year temporary entry permit granted to nationals of the People's Republic of China who were in Australia on 20 June 1989.

         The rationale for this provision is that these people have already been given protection which satisfies Australia's international obligations.

         The amendments will also allow the Minister to determine processing priorities so that processing of new applications for refugee status is not impeded by the existence of a backlog of unprocessed applications. Applications will no longer be processed in chronological order of receipt. Rather, applications in the backlog will be processed in tandem with new applications. The Government wishes to eliminate any incentive for persons with no claim to refugee status to lodge ill-founded applications simply to achieve continued residence in Australia while awaiting processing of their applications.   The amendment will also provide that applications in the backlog shall not be found to be subject to an unreasonable delay merely because other applications received more recently are being processed or have already been determined.

         Existing laws have not had the desired deterrent effect.

         The scheme outlined in this Bill is the result of discussion between the relevant State and Federal agencies. It is the first step in a much wider strategy and indicates our determination to deal with this problem effectively. The scheme will render any crew member of a fishing vessel apprehended liable for the cost of his custody and removal from Australia. The master, owner, agent or charterer of the relevant vessel will also be liable for that cost. The Secretary of my Department will be able to serve a notice on State and Territory gaols, banks or other financial institutions that may hold funds in trust for these prisoners. The notice will require them to pay the funds to my Department up to the amount of a person's liability. The scheme, together with the present capacity to confiscate fishing boats and to impose gaol sentences, increases the disincentives for these fishermen to fish illegally in Australian waters.

         Business Migration

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I turn now to the amendments which relate to business migrants who arrive in Australia. The Bill provides a legal framework to implement two aspects of the Government's new business skills migration category, which I announced on 17 December 1991. The first is a system of mandatory participation by business skills migrants in the monitoring of their business activities after their arrival in Australia. The second is the creation of a power for the Minister to cancel permanent entry permits and entry visas of business skills migrants after their arrival in Australia if they do not enter into business activities which meet the objectives of the category or make a genuine effort to do so. These provisions will apply to such migrants within their first three years after arrival in Australia. The Minister cannot cancel entry permits or visas unless action is initiated within the three-year period.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The provisions of the Bill relating to mandatory participation in monitoring introduce a requirement for business skills migrants to provide business related information and notification of changes of address after their arrival in Australia. There are financial penalties for non-compliance with these requirements which are considered and fair. Payment of fines will not release migrants from the requirement to furnish information.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am confident that the information gathered will serve to confirm the value of this form of migration. It should minimise much of the criticism of business migration which has been prevalent, but largely unfounded, in recent years. Also, aggregated data from the monitoring will be available to help those involved in planning services to assist migrants in business. The individual information on migrants will of course be protected by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second part of these changes deal with the power to cancel entry permits and visas. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the new arrangements for business migration should not use a system of conditional visas. The Government accepted that recommendation. Nevertheless, it is appropriate for the Minister to have the power to deal with cases of serious abuse. This concept is incorporated in these provisions.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Each business migrant acknowledges at the time of application that he or she understands the business objectives of the category and the expectation that they will make genuine efforts to comply with them. Additionally, each business migrant acknowledges that they and their family members' entry permits may be cancelled if they do not meet the objectives of the program or make genuine efforts to do so.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill gives the Minister clear legislative indicators on which a decision is to be based if cancellation is being considered. The overwhelming majority of business migrants are not likely to be affected by the use of this power. Only those whose intentions are inconsistent with the objectives of the category need have any concern about its use. I do not anticipate that the power will be exercised on more than a few occasions.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill includes provisions which mean that the power cannot be used against a business migrant unless the Minister has notified him or her of the intention to do so within three years of the migrant's arrival in Australia. This provision allows business migrants time to make sensible business decisions. It also allows sufficient time for an assessment to be made that the business is likely to be of ongoing benefit. It also recognises that, as permanent residents, business migrants should not be under the threat of cancellation indefinitely. There is a requirement for the Minister to consider any submission by or on behalf of the business migrant. The Bill provides for determinative review by the AAT.

         These amendments relating to business migrants will help to ensure the successful operation of the business skills category of the migration program. The Bill will also maximise economic outcomes arising from it and provide the Government with a stronger information base from which to make decisions in future. This is achieved without placing unnecessarily onerous conditions on business skills migrants. Business migrants have proven skills of value to Australia. Their entry has the continuing support of government at all levels as well as of the business community.

         The purpose of the Migration Act is to enable the Commonwealth to exercise its power to control certain persons or categories of persons who may lawfully enter and stay in this country. It has always been the intention of this Government, and previous governments before it, that this power should be exercised with the public interest in mind. One means of ensuring that the public interest is observed is to define those categories of persons whom it is undesirable to have stay in Australia. Such categories include persons who make false or misleading statements or produce bogus documents, or those with highly dangerous and communicable diseases, and those persons with criminal records. Section 20 of the Migration Act defines these categories. That section requires persons falling within these categories to be recognised as illegal entrants unless the Secretary or his delegate excuses them.

         The amendment proposed to this section is in response to a Federal Court decision which has limited the power of the Commonwealth to decide who may enter and stay in Australia with regard to persons with criminal records. The intention of the Government has always been that a person who has committed a series of unrelated crimes which have resulted in that person being sentenced, in total, to a period of 12 months or more imprisonment should be categorised as a person to whom section 20 applies. The court decision, however, requires that this provision be interpreted very narrowly. It would apply only to a person in circumstances where there is a court order that several sentences of imprisonment are to be served consecutively so as to make up one continuous period of detention of at least one year. The amendment proposed to section 20 will make this longstanding policy of the Government clear in the legislation and overcome the narrow interpretation of the court.

         The amendments will not operate retrospectively to apply to persons who have, pursuant to the decision of the Federal Court, been lawfully resident in Australia and whose circumstances meet those described in the amendment to section 20(1)(d)(iii). In respect of these persons who may be outside Australia at the time of commencement of the amendment, they will not be caught by the amendment. In effect, the amendment will not apply to such persons in respect of any convictions which may have occurred before the commencement of the amendment.

That status is effective from the date of grant of that entry permit rather than from the date of entry to Australia as presently provided for in the Act.

         As previously agreed, the 3c levy was to be phased out as airports were transferred. The result of this Bill is that there will be an initial drop of 1c per litre and a further drop of 1c when the number of Commonwealth airports is reduced to 100. Ultimately the levy will be fully phased out by June 1993.

         With the South Australian airports now out of the ALOP scheme, and with others moving apace to withdraw, the aviation industry has been calling for the reductions and has expressed concern to me that so far nothing has happened. The principal concern was that the Commonwealth and the Government were collecting from the general aviation sector money for services which were no longer being provided. There was simply no longer a funding requirement to be paid for from the levy on avgas in the case of South Australia.

         It is little wonder that the aviation industry believes it is being treated as simply a source of revenue to fill the Government's coffers.

         The Opposition is not against the transfer of airports; in fact, we encourage it. The efficiencies and competition that local ownership can bring are to be encouraged. They have the potential to boost regional economies and generate long awaited employment growth. Local ownership can bring benefits to a community. Look at the dominance that Cairns, for example, now has in the international aviation area. Cairns is the fastest growing international airport in Australia, despite what has been a most restrictive international aviation policy during the life of this Government.

         On the other hand, there are more than 200 other airstrips which will not be prime international, or even national, destinations. However, they do play a vital role in their communities, particularly in permitting medical evacuations or in providing basic air transport services. The Government has made no secret of the fact that with the termination of the ALOP scheme it could not care less if some of these strips were forced to close as a result of this policy. While some aerodromes will receive termination funds to bring them up to standard at the end of ALOP, others will get nothing. They will be forced by the Government to close.

         Others, especially those with meagre scheduled services, will have to pass their costs on to commuter operators, who in turn will have to pass them on to passengers. What will be the impact of this if some operators in the communities have to undertake that? Let us look at an example, the city of Portland in Victoria, where, to maintain the aerodrome, a charge of $35 to $37 per ticket, or per passenger movement, would have to be levied to meet the maintenance requirements. With a marginal service now, would an extra $70-odd on a return ticket to Melbourne be an attractive proposition to commuters? Obviously not.

Whilst the report concedes that not all aerodromes are commercially viable and that social benefit subsidies will be provided in certain cases, it should not be forgotten that this takes the form of a one-off payment at the time of withdrawal or transfer from ALOP. By phasing out the program by 1993 the Government is effectively saying, `Take it or leave it'. Local communities which do not withdraw from the program by the cut-off date will simply be left out in the cold; there will be no further money available.

That is why in recent weeks we have announced that, despite the end of ALOP, we are prepared, in government, to assist in basic maintenance of rural, remote and regional airports that are not viable under the regime established by this Government.

The investment that is being made in that airport reflects the kind of future it will have.

         The point I am making is that the last thing one would do is flog off Melbourne Airport when it is at this point of operating profitably. Last year the airport made $28m, $26m of which was ploughed straight back into investment in infrastructure on the ground. There are $250m worth of capital works taking place right now. It is one of Melbourne's great success stories. In my electorate, which features part of the airport, people are planning their working lives, their education and where they will live around the job opportunities available at the airport. In other words, important social policy affecting people's futures is geared around the operation of these airports.

         In that context, the last thing one would do is flog the airports off to John Elliott, or whoever in the private sector thinks he or she can run them. We know full well that there are major social concerns to be worked through and that airports are key job centres for many people. For instance, 10,000 people now work, in one form or another, at Melbourne Airport. That is predicted to increase to 20,000 people by the end of the decade. That is real action; that is the major job centre of the north-west corridor of Melbourne. There is no way known that an operation like thatâ€”which has so much important social policy built around itâ€”could be privatised.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          But that is the position of those on the other side of the House. They want to take not the unprofitable ones, but those government-owned operations which are working very successfully at a profit and flog them off. But this certainly will not happen while I have anything to say about itâ€”and I expect to have something to say about it for a long time yet. In terms of the legislation we are passing in the House tonightâ€”

As you know, earlier in the debate the honourable member for Fadden, who is the aviation spokesman on the other side, spoke for 30 minutes.

Let's actually talk about the fact that, under Fightback, people flying on aircraft will pay an extra 15 per cent on their tickets'. No matter how those opposite work that through, I do not see how anybody in the industryâ€”be it those at the tourist destinations, on the major business commuter lines or on the regional linesâ€”could think this is an exciting proposal.

         â€”Once a comrade, always a comradeâ€”you would call him that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just want to get down to the fundamentals of his speech. The honourable member should stay for a minute and learn something. He said that we would sell only the profitable airports and not the unprofitable ones. ALOP just happens to be all about unprofitable airportsâ€”airports which are unprofitable, not through the inefficiencies we find in all government enterprises, but simply because they are providing a very infrequent service in remote areas. It is a service which is dramatically and drastically needed, but of course the traffic patterns are such that there will never be sufficient revenueâ€”asking any price that is reasonableâ€”to cover the costs.

          But there are others who choose to go out into very remote areas, produce money and take the responsibilities that go with it to help this economy.

Why are all the jobs that the honourable member for Burke worries about going to disappear if they are fair dinkum jobs, if they are needed to run that airport efficiently? He paints the picture that one day Mr Elliott and his mates are going to spend hundreds of millions buying it and the next day they are going to close it down.

We have the facade of the Federal Airports Corporation. We tell ourselves that it is not a government body, but there is nobody else in it. We may as well say Qantas is not a government body.

I crossed the floor, something I have never seen him do in the interest of his own constituents. I did not believe in the two-airline policy. Philosophically, I am opposed to it. When this Government started to move in the deregulation direction, I applauded it, until I found out what it was up to. It was another facade. It was not for real. Yes, the airlines can now be competed with. All the new ones have to do is find somewhere to park their aeroplanes and pick up their passengers! It is an outrageous arrangement.

We were building a brand new government-funded airport terminal. All the plans were there.

In particular, I have been responding to his comments about Melbourne Airport which, of course, is not subject to ALOP, although in our view it probably should be. This is the most remarkable thing about it. Our major airports, of which the honourable member for Burke claims we have too many, will continually be funded by government. But the smaller ones, where people are struggling, are to be dumped onto the local community. That is really what this legislation is about.

         The honourable member for Burke also raised the hardy annual, the subject of simple arithmeticâ€”and that is not surprising, I guessâ€”which says that a GST adds 15 per cent to the cost of an airline ticket. However, simple arithmetic does not point out that the excise, which this legislation clearly says is 24.7c a litre, is to be progressively reduced by 3c a litre, making it 21.7c a litre. Three cents a litre is to come off the cost of operating airlines, which are very big consumers of fuel.

When it comes off, of course, there will be a substantial fall in the price of tickets. The prices of airline tickets will fall through a combination of lower prices and the removal of the sales tax on just about everything an airline buys, including the packaging which is involved with their meals.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I might add that being a politician who has been around for a while, I can always stand an intelligent interjection; and I would like one of those to turn up before the debate is over. It is a fact that this ALOP arrangement has over timeâ€”and it was commenced under a Liberal governmentâ€”demonstrated that bit by bit local communities can handle airports. Where the traffic is reasonable in towns such as in Geraldton in my electorate the local authorities have almost found it profitable to be involved. I well remember that in the case of Albany, which is not part of my electorate now, the shire and the town fought over who had responsibility for looking after the airport. The shire happened to have the airport within its boundaries and the shire president sat down and worked out that he could even make a small profit. He was a very smart man, because the town constantly complained about his residents using its library and all the facilities that the town supplied. After that he said, `Well, don't you complain; I am supplying you the airport'. In fact, he was getting reasonable revenue from the airport, but because, I repeat, Albany is a fairly substantial population centre.

         That does not alter the fact that the honourable member for Burke raised the various problems that he perceived with our policies, in particular the application of the goods and services tax. I have pointed out a couple of times some of the interjections we have had from the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I represent an area of Western Australia that is sparsely populated. It takes 220,000 square kilometres to gather up 70,000 voters; in the case of the Northern Territory, it would probably be 500,000 square kilometres. It is in these areas that, firstly, we need ALOP and, secondly, we do not want taxes on fuels for aircraft or motor vehicles. I am astounded to hear members of the Labor Party who represent the isolated areas, particularly of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia, bucketing a proposal that would take 19c to 26c a litre off the price of fuel, be it for a motorist or for a pilot landing at one of these ALOP airports.

         I am also astounded when those honourable members stand up and criticise the package which says that people whom they represent typically get higher wages, not because they are substantially better off, but because they need those additional wages to meet the cost of living in those remote areas. Those people will be the biggest beneficiaries of the Fightback tax package. It is amazing that those members who really and truly have a constituent responsibility to see that their constituents get a little bit of help with their remote area airports because it becomes financially impossible to sustain them do not want the cut in fuel prices, although their constituents will benefit the most. Those members know that the wages paid in their districts are higher, so, of course, their constituents are forced into higher tax brackets, yet they criticise a policy that alters all those things. I find that amazing because, as I have demonstrated in this place, I have always been prepared to put the welfare of my constituents above any commitment of any other nature. If we cannot come to this place with that responsibility, it is pretty rotten. When people vote for us in the constituent base that we have, with separate electorates, they expect that we will first represent their interests.

We do not believe the Government should get rid of ALOP support altogether; that is all. That stands in contrast to the Government. There is a point at which we say stop because there is a group of airports, some of which are clearly not included in this hundred that are yet to go, where the local demand will not allow these things to happen.

This container has been taken away by a unionâ€”I think the Transport Workers Unionâ€”because somebody in IPEC got the sack last week. The union has said, like big kids, `We'll give it back to you when you reinstate this person'. My constituents went to the police about thisâ€”I will not tell honourable members the words that they used when they said how the police dealt with themâ€”but it was not to `buzz off'.

We have the situation in Perth today that I have outlined. I might add that these fuel strikes in airports have also added to delays in people getting necessary parts and equipment to carry out their farming exercise.

         Under the aerodrome local ownership plan, ownership of airports was transferred to local bodies, usually the local authority, but under the arrangements the Commonwealth undertook to make a 50 per cent contribution to approved maintenance and development costs into the future. That arrangement has worked very well and has been accepted by the majority of Australian airports. I am told that in 1988-89 there were 363 licensed aerodromes in Australia, and 277 of them were in the aerodrome local ownership plan. Some of the balance were Commonwealth owned airports in capital cities which did not really fit the mould for the ALOP.

         The program has been very well accepted. There has been some local cost. Local communities were expected under the program to meet 50 per cent of the costs of all projects under the scheme. They were obliged to meet that cost, but I think that was a worthwhile aspect of the program because it ensured that the projects which were undertaken had local support. The fact that so many community councils and so many local organisations were supportive of the aerodrome local ownership plan is a clear demonstration of the fact that it was good and working well for Australia.

The fifty-fifty contribution scheme demonstrates the very best way in which a government can deal with communities: supporting those which are prepared to help themselves. Therefore, I think it is most regrettable that the Government has decided to walk away from its responsibilities to rural and provincial aviation and to abandon this scheme.

         This kind of frustration with the program was fundamentally the reason why the Cairns Port Authority, the local owner of the Cairns Airport, chose to withdraw from the scheme altogether. Cairns, of course, has gone on to become the success story of the Australian airport scene. It has certainly encouraged, through its own entrepreneurial approach, access to Cairns for international airlines, and also the tremendous growth in domestic traffic. Cairns was one of the major beneficiaries of the competition created by Compass and its airport has grown extensively.

The fact is that Cairns is a new and major gateway to Australia. That opportunity is not available to most of the other 277 Australian airports in the aerodrome local ownership plan.

         In August 1990 the Government announced that it would axe the ALOP. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support at the time, Senator Bob Collins, in his announcement, attempted to gild the lily. He described in his press statement of 21 August that what the Government was going to do was to invite local communities `to take over the management and operation of Commonwealth aerodromes in their own areas'. Those that were already under local ownership were to be encouraged `to take over full responsibility for aerodromes now jointly funded by the Commonwealth under the ALOP'. But the real message of the press release was the boot that came at the end of it, where the Minister went on to say:

In other words, either they took the poison or the Government would shoot them. There was no attempt whatsoever by the Government to negotiate arrangements with any of the local owners. It merely announced that the program was ending, not because the local communities wanted it to go, but because the government could not care less about country people, country airports and provincial cities and their aviation needs.

         In announcing the end of the program, the Government indicated that there would be some kind of continuing subsidy programâ€”a social benefits scheme. There were to be basically six categories of airports. There were those that were considered to be viable, which naturally were to receive no subsidy. Then four categories of social subsidy were to be made available, ranging from 100 per cent down to 25 per cent. The very largest group comprised airports which were not viable but were not going to be given any money by the Government anyhow.

Hervey Bay, on the other handâ€”one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, with a population now over 30,000â€”has an inadequate runway, no cross-runway at all, and its terminal building is a demountable structure. There have been local proposals to build a new joint airport. The needs of Hervey Bay city will require additional airport facilities before many years pass by.

We only have to read the report of the Federal Airports Corporation to realise that most of the airports under its control are not profitable;  yet this Government is telling small provincial cities that their airportsâ€”let alone the airports in those small country towns that are on the listâ€”are expected to be viable. How will Eulo make a profit out of running its airport? How can it possibly expect to fund the operation of its airport?

The Government is suggesting that the towns should collect money from things such as passenger surchargesâ€”not very helpful if there is no passenger serviceâ€”and concessions. I have not noticed the car rental companies queuing up to take space at the airport at Dysart, Injune or Innisfail, because there is no chance of making any money there.

         What about rentals for aircraft and that sort of thing? Clearly, if one airport rents out its space, people will go to another place. The clear answer is that the only way in which those airports can be kept operating is if the ratepayers pick up the tab. I notice the former Minister for Local Government, now the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), is here. I am disappointed that she was not prepared to stand up for local government, which is left carrying the baby of maintaining airports around Australia because this Government has walked away from its responsibilities in that regard.

         In the One Nation statement the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the Government would speed up the finalisation of the aerodrome local ownership plan. Now the Government is in the process of picking off the airports, one by one, breaking the agreements that it made with the local owners at the time the airports were handed over. Let us not forget that. In each case when these airports were handed over to the local owners, there was an agreement made with those local owners that the Commonwealth would continue to fund maintenance and other approved development works. In some cases that was by way of exchange of correspondence; but in other cases it was by way of a formal contract, a contract that the Government is now walking away from, dishonouring the word that this Government and previous governments have given over previous years.

If the airports are not maintained at a reasonable standard, they will not keep the licence. The Government, while walking away from any financial responsibility to maintain airports, is still, naturally enough, requiring that the airports be kept to a high standard so that any aircraft wishing to use them can be guaranteed the ability to land in safety. There will be local ownership. The Government will pay nothing, but will still set the standards for the new local owners to abide by.

         While country people are expected to do without, city people have hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lavish new airport facilities. One Badgerys Creek would fund the needs of all of the rural and provincial airports of Australia for decades. Indeed, the Government is clearly adopting double standards. The Prime Minister talked about one nation, but he is prepared to offer facilities and a standard of airport maintenance and aircraft services in cities while, at the same time, he walks away from previously existing responsibilities in rural areas. One Nation boosted expenditure on rail and city airport facilities, but it slashed expenditure and walked away entirely from an obligation towards people who need air services in rural or provincial areas.

         Of course, rural aviation, like all of the aviation industry, has been a significant contributor to tax revenue. The Australian Airport Owners Association estimated that less than 50 per cent of the tax revenue that the Government collects from aviation is actually spent on rural and provincial aviation. While the legislation before the House will reduce the amount of tax collected, it also signals significant reductions in the amount of expenditure for rural and provincial aviation.

In my own electorate the airports in Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Gympie were the only means of getting to those cities, with populations totalling 70,000, during the recent floods. The Government has taken flooding into account in setting its points test. However, the towns have to be isolated for continuous periods of four weeks in every year before qualifying for consideration under the flooding criterion. I tell honourable members that a lot can happen and a lot of people can get sick in four weeks. Yet the Government is not prepared to take account of short term flooding needs.

         The purpose of the amendments to the legislation is to permit the phasing out of the collection of that proportion of avgas duty that is currently attributed to the Department of Transport and Communications aerodrome cost recovery program.

         The current rate of duty on avgas is 27.480c per litre, of which 3.010c is attributable to aerodrome cost recovery purposes. The balance of the duty is attributable to cost recovery for aviation functions carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority. I think that is important. I would like honourable members in the House, particularly the honourable member for Wide Bay, to remember that, because later in my speech I want to come to the outrageous assertions that have been made by him and some of his colleagues.

         This legislation enables the 3.010c to be phased out, while retaining the existing level of revenue entitlements that the Civil Aviation Authority has under the present Act. The Bill will allow immediate amendment to the customs and excise tariffs to provide a 1c reduction in the avgas duty. A further 1c reduction in the avgas duty will take place when the combined number of Commonwealth aerodromes and ALOP aerodromes is reduced to 100. The final component of duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program is scheduled to be removed in June 1993.

         As I said in the second reading speech, the Bill is a tangible reflection of the benefits which are flowing to the general aviation industry from the Government's aviation reformsâ€”in particular its policies on aerodrome local ownership. I will come to the honourable member for Wide Bay shortly, but I want to deal firstly with the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who does not seem to have a very good understanding at all of what this legislation is about. He made a statement in his speech about the aerodrome which services his electorateâ€”and I assume he was talking about Bendigo. What he ought to know is that the Bendigo Aerodrome Committee is currently negotiating, as part of the Victorian Municipal Aerodromes Operators Association, a group withdrawal from ALOP. Negotiations started today with the Department of Transport and Communications, and I might say that some very reasonable proposals have been put to the Department by these people. It is hoped that negotiations over the Bendigo airport will be concluded before the end of the financial year. The honourable member omitted to mention that. His fairyland contribution to the debate is made all the more fairyland by a statement he made about what the aerodrome is capable of doing. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The airport is quite capable of handling some quite large aeroplanes. In fact, Prince Charles and Princess Diana visited Bendigo in an RAAF aircraft, which was equivalent to about a 707 size aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have got news for him. The Bendigo aerodrome is 1,100 metres in length and it is 18 metres wide. The maximum take-off weight of any aircraft from that aerodrome is 5,700 kilograms. The lightest take-off weight for a 707 is 71,000 kilograms. It needs 2,000 metres to land a 707, not 1,100. So, when the honourable member comes into this House parading his knowledge of his own aerodrome, he ought at least come with the facts. As I said, I guess one could say that in this instance he has had a complete flight of fancy, because that is exactly what it was. He has also made some assertions which indicate again that he has no understanding at allâ€”and I might say this permeates through the Opposition ranksâ€”

He said, `The Government is going to rip it off them from avgas, anyway'. I take honourable members back to what I said earlier in my contributionâ€”that the final component of duty in terms of this aerodrome cost recovery program will be removed in June 1993, but that once we move that amount attributable to the Department of Transport and Communications, or to the Government, the remainder is for the costs of running civil aviation and goes to the Civil Aviation Authority. The $26m that has been referred to comes off budget. It does not, never did and never was anticipated to come from these aerodrome users.

         The Department of Finance claims that the reasons for the delay were due to administrative and drafting priorities within the Attorney-General's Department. This demonstrates yet again the problems the Government is obviously having in getting its legislation drafted in any reasonable sense of time or priority. In regard to the need for transitional arrangements, however, it has been demonstrated since that time that there have apparently been no cases in which people have fallen within the provisions of the Act, which I think is a rather amusing situation. Nevertheless, the legislation was important because it provided initially for the establishment of the public sector superannuation scheme.

         In 1990, of course, a new superannuation scheme was introduced for Commonwealth employees which became effective on 1 July 1990. It replaced what was previously known as the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. These amendments are backdated effectively to that period to bring them into line with the closing date for any new entrants to the CSS.

         Due to the delay in bringing these amendments to the Parliament, the Bill provides for transitional or savings provisions to four Acts so that any action that might inadvertently have been taken that is inconsistent with the amendments will not be invalidated.

         It is worth noting that the new arrangements were run by the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. Its annual report for 1991 demonstrates quite clearly that the administration of the trust is responsible for the contributions of some 200,000 public servants, worth approximately $9 billion. It is interesting to look back and see what was said by some people at the time of the passage of the legislation and since then. For example, on 2 July 1991 Senator Bob McMullan said that Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, replacing the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, would do even better than its predecessor.

         Let us take this opportunity to briefly examine the record. In September 1991, the Queensland-based Kern Corporation collapsed. That put in jeopardy the value of property investments owned by the CFM. In fact, the CFM jointly owns, with Kern, over half of two major office buildings in both Sydney and Melbourne. In 1991, the CFM, according to its annual report, recorded a dismal investment return of negative 0.8 per cent after tax. As of February this year, the CFM still owned the poorly performing central business district properties including Grosvenor Place in Sydney and 101 Collins Street in Melbourne.

         I would like to take this opportunity to widen the debate perhaps to cover the whole issue of superannuation in the context of Australian investment policy. Quite clearly everyone would like to retire with financial security. That is one of the things we hear glibly spoken of, often on both sides of the House and certainly, in recent days, to an excessive extent by members of the Government and by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) himself who, as I have said on a number of occasions already in this House, refused to actually present himself, to take his own legislation yesterday and to give the House the benefit of his views on the comments made by members on both sides. Unfortunately, this demonstrates yet again the contempt in which members of the Government hold this Parliament, and it undoubtedly gives Australian people reason to believe that the Parliament is no longer relevant when they see Ministers of the Government refusing to actually perform and do their duty in the House.

         As Australia has an ageing population, the cost of providing adequate pensions into the twenty-first century will obviously be a major issue of public policy. At present there is one pensioner for every seven workers paying tax. In 20 years there will be one pensioner to three workers. Clearly one has to ask the question: will those people be able or willing to pay higher taxes to maintain more pensioners? The sad fact is that over the last 10 years, despite the considerable reforms which have been introduced by the Government in the superannuation area, the whole subject is incredibly complex and the industry itself is in such a situation that very few, if any, superannuation advisers can in all genuineness be able to say to their clients precisely what their end benefits will be.

         The outcome of all this is that Labor has failed to establish a fair system which encourages everyone to provide for additional income in retirement. Perhaps the most obvious way to define what is fair in terms of retirement planning is to put to honourable members the simple realities of the situation. At the present time high income earners obtain a benefit in terms of taxation of about 32c in the dollar. For low income workers, from average income and below, the benefit is as low as 6c in the dollar. The sad fact is that thousands upon thousands of Australian workers who have not in the past been contributing to superannuation are effectively, through their taxation, supporting larger taxation benefits for the top end of town. Yet we hear from a Labor government, which claims of course to be looking after the ordinary people, that that is in fact what it calls fair. The Opposition believes absolutely that this is a clear example of how the Government fails, in terms of policy formulation, to address the fundamental issues which are so important at this time.

         The coalition, therefore, has been concerned about this matter for sometime because it shares with the Government the belief that people must be encouraged to go into superannuation, whether they be public servants or non-public servants. The fundamental issue between us is whether or not people on relatively low incomes ought to be forced into superannuation schemes which result in a diminution in their actual in-hand income. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made clear in Question Time yesterday that under this proposal people would be effectively putting 9 per cent of their income into superannuation, with the effect that there would be a negligible increase in wages, that is, wages in the hand. If I may quote from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

Mr Keating confirmed that the increase in contributions would be absorbed into wage demands. . . This commitment could mean very low cash wage increases over this decade unless workers are able to obtain pay rises for productivity gains.

        The Opposition on many occasions has made the point that it believes that pay rises and productivity gains quite clearly should go hand in hand. What we are concerned about is the absolute basis of this whole proposition, which simply states, in the words of the Treasury spokesmen before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that the Treasury would expect in the preparation of its estimates, in this particular case, that there will be over the next few years an increase of some 14 per cent in productivity.

         One would have to say that, on the basis of recent years, one can hope for it; but Australia's recent record does not bear that out in terms of what has actually occurred. The difficulty I am putting to the House is simply this: it means, on the face of it, that ordinary workers will be asked effectively to give up a salary increase of most of 14 per centâ€”certainly 9 per cent of that 14 per cent, assuming they get thereâ€”which leaves only a very small amount of 5 per cent. In addition, the earlier legislation talked about contributions of a further 3 per cent. The Commonwealth superannuation scheme is a two-tiered arrangement by which employers are expectedâ€”in other words, the Commonwealthâ€”to fund the 3 per cent award payment quite separately from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund itself.

         As I said in my opening remarks, the Government has done a marvellous job over the last eight years of introducing into Australia undoubtedly the most complex and convoluted superannuation arrangements known anywhere in the world. I urge the House to seriously consider this: what other country has a five-tier superannuation system and has got a government which has the temerity to come into the House, whether it is talking about this public sector scheme or a private sector national scheme, and say, `We have a simple scheme that covers everybody.'?

         The basic problem in all of this, and I alluded to it earlier, is: to what extent is the saving going to be made? According to Treasury estimates, whether we are talking about public sector superannuation or private sector superannuation, there will be no savings in terms of the payment of end benefits, that is, age pensions. That is one of the pillars upon which this whole package is meant to standâ€”whether or not these superannuation changes will have the effect of making long term savings.

         It is estimated by the Treasury that those savings will not occur before the year 2020. That is an estimate based on demographic trends, ageing of the population and so forth. A significant numberâ€”millionsâ€”of Australian workers are on average incomes and below and may be in low yielding superannuation schemes. `Low yielding' fits two definitions, one being the actual return on a person's investment. The fact that Labor has effectively increased superannuation taxes by over 1,000 per cent over the last eight years clearly has an effect on the return on investment, and that affects public service schemes just as much as it affects private sector schemes.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition, we have the difficulty I have noted already in the SFIT funding arrangements where we have had a taxation system in place which has encouraged fund managers to put an excessive amount of workers' contributions into real estate. The outcome of all that in recent years is that most funds have either had a negative or very near negative response at a time when the rate of inflation has been considerably higher. SFIT talked about a minus 0.8 per cent return in the last year, 1990-91. In truth, if it took inflation into account, it would be considerably less again.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The difficulty we are facing in Australia today, because of the sheer complexity of the system, is that people are seriously questioning why they should go into superannuation. Public servants have the biggest disadvantage of all in that if people go into a Public Service job they have no choice; they are required by law to put their money into the Commonwealth scheme.

         It is the view of the Oppositionâ€”and it is laid out clearly in our policyâ€”that workers, whether they be Commonwealth public servants or private sector servants, should have a degree of choice as to where their investments are placed. This does not necessarily mean that people should switch across every 12 months every time they grab an annual report and say, `My word! My fund is two points less effective than somebody else's'. But it does mean that people are not locked into a scheme for their entire lifeâ€”or certainly while they are working for a particular employerâ€”if they genuinely believe that their funds can work better for them elsewhere. That is one of the major problems.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The other major problem which the Government has not addressed is the fact that well over one million Australian workersâ€”including about 25 per cent of public servants who are covered under the proposals in this legislationâ€”are in the difficult situation of being temporary workers. The recent legislation suggests changes which will bring people below certain income levels into the scheme.

         But I put to the Governmentâ€”as we have done elsewhere at other timesâ€”the serious proposition that the cost of running those schemes is so high that the end benefit will be severely affected. That is so in many cases. For example, if we are talking about a 3 per cent fund and 1.5 per cent is being spent on insurance and administration costs, the worker has automatically lost half of his or her contribution. There is taxation on top of that. Perhaps workers may leave the work force for a number of monthsâ€”for example, on maternity leaveâ€”and may not continue to fund their schemes. If workers do that a few times in their lives, then, believe me, it is not difficult to come up with a formula by which it is clear that although people may have thought that they had a contribution which would result in a nice nest egg, in truth there will be very littleâ€”if anythingâ€”there at all.

         The Opposition has put a lot of thought into this. In 1986 I suggested in our draft policyâ€”and I have spoken about this in the House on a number of occasionsâ€”that the easiest answer was to try to link together what we call retirement savings accounts, which are precisely directed at part time and temporary workers; especially women. These would act as a bridge between periods in and out of the work force.

         By and large, the legislation which has been before the Houseâ€”and is before the House again in terms of the enabling Billâ€”has a fundamental weakness. At best, a superannuation contribution in the public sector is frozen: there is no way in which one could effectively add to it, unless one is actually in a job. For example, if a person took nine months maternity leaveâ€”which is a quite normal thing to do in the public sectorâ€”that person's rights to superannuation were protected at the standard rate which applied at the time that person took that leave. But there was no means of making further contributions during that period.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If we have a retirement savings account-type arrangement, it has the big advantage of working just like a bank account. When people have spare money, they put it in. If one is working part time and one's employer makes a contribution of about 3 per cent in terms of the legislationâ€”and the Opposition is committed to accepting that 3 per cent in terms of our policy, but we believe that any further contributions in addition to that should be on the basis of negotiation between employers and employees as part of the overall wages packageâ€”by making contributions to a retirement savings account in that form, it acts as a bridge between those periods in and out of the work force. If people then transfer back into the Public Service, their retirement savings account can be closed if they wish and the funds transferred into their mainline scheme.

         Alternativelyâ€”and I made this point earlierâ€”there is a total lack of freedom of choice for public servants in the system at the present time. There again, the retirement savings account has the advantage. If people prefer to use that as their vehicle for long term saving and, ultimately, for providing their retirement income; so be it. The big advantage would be flexibility and the sure knowledge that they would not be caught for large administration costsâ€”which is currently the reality for most superannuation schemes in this country and, in particular, the 3 per cent so-called productivity schemes which were introduced by the Government a few years ago.

         I make one point: employees do seek secure retirement income. As we all get closer to retirement, we look for ways of ensuring that our retirement income will be guaranteed. It is in order to answer that need that the Government has responded with the legislation which is now on its way through the Parliament. That legislation will ensure that all employees are covered by superannuation. That is a major advance in social policy in Australia. Despite all of the obfuscation and complexity of the speech by the honourable member for Bradfield, the outcome is something that employees would generally welcome. It is certainly something that I welcome strongly.

         This Bill is, I think, the most inconsequential Bill I have ever debated in this Parliament. It is called the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992, but it uses the term `consequential' to mean amendments that flow from, not amendments that are important to, the superannuation legislation. The amendments are so technical and so recondite that, as the previous speaker said, they have not covered one person so far.

Arguably, that aircraft was imposed on the Defence Force some years ago by this Government to avoid any embarrassment about its production and poor commercial attraction. It would be fair to say not only that it is unsuitable for the types of operations required of the Australian Army Aviation Corps or the RAAF but also that it has a less than satisfactory performance envelope, arguably under certain conditions degenerating into a longitudinally unstable platform and, in the extreme, a potential threat to the lives of those who fly it.

I am referring to the commercial television industry, which does not seem to understand the responsibilities to the Australian public that it is expected to shoulder in return for the privileged position that it enjoys.

         In September 1987 the commercial networks were given the opportunity to demonstrate that they could regulate themselves with regard to the amount of advertising they inflict on their audiences. They had the chance to show that they could be trusted to run themselves in a responsible fashion.

         When the industry pleaded its case for self-regulation, it said that it was not driven by greed, it did not want to grab more time for advertising and therefore rob viewers of even more programming time. The networks said they simply wanted the freedom to experiment to get a better and more diverse mix of ads and programsâ€”for the ultimate benefit of viewers, of course. But the reality of the next three years clearly demonstrated that the commercial networks were not worthy of that public trust.

          A 1990 comparison showed that even that bastion of capitalism the United States had less advertising on television than Australia.

Britain and France averaged six minutes per hour, New Zealand nine minutes, South Africa less than five minutes, and so on.

         When the Tribunal eventually reviewed how the networks had performed as self-regulators this is the picture that emerged. Firstly, all three networks had increased their advertising time per hour substantially. An independent study by AIM Data found that TV stations were running as much as 19 minutes of ads and non-program material in an hour of prime time viewing. Secondly, the networks deliberately targeted children's television, running more ads between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., the peak viewing times for children. This is of particular concern as studies have found a strong correlation between advertising and poor dietary habits in children. Thirdly, the number of ads has increased. Instead of fewer 30-second ads, the networks are running more 15-second ads. Fourthly, the networks have deliberately targeted the second half of feature movies. They have cynically worked out that if viewers have sat through the first half of a movie, they are going to want to stay till the end.

         In other words, the networks did the precise opposite of what they said they would do: they cynically exploited their new found freedom to pull in more ad revenue by selling more time and bombarding both children's and adults' prime time. They showed contempt for their audiences, for the Tribunal and for the Government.

         I should point out that the standards the Tribunal has decided to apply to the industry are really quite generous. From March the amount of advertising and non-program matter was limited to an average of 14 minutes during prime time, with a maximum of 15 minutes in any one hour. In September this will come down to 13 minutes, with a limit of 15 minutes in any given hour, still the highest in the Western world.

         The television industry pleaded that it is in such tough times that the revenue loss would guarantee lower program quality, but it is misleading to base future expectations on the bad times of the past couple of years. Channel Nine's shares on the stock market have quadrupled since Kerry Packer bought it back. Advertising companies have increased their budgets by 7 1/2 per cent this year, and the signs of a general recovery in the economy are also increasing. As the Tribunal has pointed out, if the networks simply reduce the time they spend promoting their own programs by one minute in every hour, the new rules would have no effect on advertising revenue at all.

         â€”The people of New South Wales have reacted with anger at the deal done by the Premier, Mr Greiner, and his Environment Minister, Mr Moore, with Dr Terry Metherell, the renegade Liberal. Metherell's desertion of the Liberal Party and his hypocritical self-proclamation as the `independent member for Davidson' was bad news for the Greiner minority Government. The Government's slim hold on power, as a minority Government, is under pressure and threatened by investigations of three of its back bench MPs. It is easy to see why Greiner and Moore were tempted to do a deal with Metherell, but that does not excuse their actions.

         The deal involved Metherell resigning his seat in Parliament so that it could return to the Liberal Party in a by-election. The quid pro quo for Metherell was the appointment to the Senior Executive Service and a five-year contract at $110,000 a year in the new Environment Protection Authority.

         Public disgust was shown in the Davidson by-election, which the Government brought on with undue and undemocratic haste. In spite of a two-day nomination period and the lack of an ALP candidate, the Liberal candidate was forced to preferences. Twenty-five per cent of Liberal voters changed their vote. That happened in a seat in which in 1991 Metherell as a Liberal candidate was returned with 65 per cent of the primary vote despite a recent and well-publicised conviction for tax evasion and a sacking from the Ministry.

         In the 1928 Scholes Royal Commission an investigation was carried out into the Federal seat of Dalley, resigned in 1927 by William Mahony, an ALP member. In the subsequent election, Edward Theodore, a member of the ALP and a former Premier of Queensland, became the member for Dalley. It was found that Mahony received over #5,000 the day before his resignation and that Mahony's explanationâ€”that he won it on the Melbourne Cupâ€”was not believable. Mahony later spent #3,000 of the money to buy a pub in Balmain. The Royal Commissioner could not trace the source of most of the money paid to Mahony but did find out that #200 of it came direct from Theodore. Royal Commissioner Scholes concluded, in his words:

         â€”No doubt many  honourable members in this House have heard of the very recent Women's Electoral Lobby study on the goods and consumption tax. The Women's Electoral Lobby took each room in a house and looked at the kinds of costs which exist now and those that would exist under a GST, taking into account the wholesale sales tax. It was assisted by a whole range of companies to pursue the matter, and its findings are, of course, quite dramatic. In round figures, it looked at roughly 500 items and found that at least 450 would be dearer.

A further letter from the Department on 23 April stated that it was considered that developments could proceed without specific searching. This was also the case, according to the letter, with the Burns Beach area. However, the area between Quinns Rock was mentioned by the Department as being possibly affected, based on uncorroborated anecdotal sources. It was considered that the sources may have referred only to Burns Beach, and it was stated that the risk of continuing contamination in the area was low and development could proceed without specific searching.

         In the Two Rocks area, as a result of State Emergency Service research, the SES recommended that no further subdivision take place without a search for UXO being conducted. In discussions between the Department and the city of Wanneroo, the Department advised that the Commonwealth Government is generally under no legal obligation to commit resources to reduce hazards associated with the presence of UXOs. According to the Department, it is considered that persons benefiting from the use or development of UXO-affected land would bear the cost of reducing UXO hazards. Furthermore, in planning to reduce UXO-related hazards, the Department's ability to assist could depend on the availability of resources to be committed. In the event that the Council elects to proceed with development proposals, the Commonwealth Government would deny any liability that may arise as a consequence of the presence of UXOs.

         The Commonwealth policy for the management of land affected by the presence of UXOs, finalised on 7 March 1991, breaks down land affected into three categories. The first is land occupied by the Commonwealth; the second is land in which the Commonwealth has divested a legal interest in the land; the third is land wherein the Commonwealth has never had, or has disposed of, its legal interest. It is the third category which appears to relate to the case of the Yanchep-Two Rocks area. The Commonwealth's position in this case will be influenced by the nature of the situation. An SES study of that area was presented to the Council in September 1991. That study proved beyond doubt that the area is polluted with UXO. The extent to which that is so cannot be stated precisely.

         â€”I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the anger of the people of Fowler at the manner in which Australia Post has altered our existing postal arrangements in the city of Liverpool. Specifically, I wish to convey our disappointment at the lack of consultation which surrounded Australia Post's bizarre decision to close and sell our centrally located, freestanding post office in order to move to rented premises on the fringe of the city. Although getting information from Australia Post has been as difficult as extracting teeth, what the people of Liverpool have learned about the corporation's plans has not eased our disquiet on the matter.

         Firstly, as I have said, we have a decision to shut down and sell a post office in the middle of the city so that Westfield, which has just spent millions of dollars extending its complex in Liverpool, can gain an important and large new tenant. Never mind the fact that Westfield is right on the fringe of the city, half a kilometre from the station, nor that $250,000 was spent less than two years ago refurbishing the public area of the current post office.

         Then we had the incredible decision to open two other postal offices apart from the Westfield main post office. One of those is to be a sorting and loading facility out of the Liverpool CBD, while the other is a business centre to cater for those businesses disadvantaged by the move. And where is the new business office going to be? Believe it or not, it is in the vicinity of the current premises, because that is where the business community is, according to Australia Post's regional manager.

         Given all of this information, one is entitled to ask Australia Post why the move is necessary in the first place. Its answer is that the current premises are too cramped, the people want a post office in Westfield, and the new arrangements represent a good deal. Unfortunately, the hundreds of people and business organisations which have contacted my office on the matter do not seem to see it as such a good deal. They ask the question: if the current premises are so cramped, why will the total space of the three rented premises be approximately the same as the premises available now?

         As for the contention that the people of Liverpool support the relocation, I must have had the misfortune of running into every malcontent on the subject in my area. Interestingly, those malcontents include the City of Liverpool RSL, the Chairman of the Liverpool City Chamber of Commerce, the Liverpool branch of the Australian Labor Party, and a host of other organisations and individuals. An odd bunch of bedfellows, perhaps, but a fairly good indicator of the depth of opposition to the move.

         The claim by Australia Post that I have found most interesting is that the relocation represents a good deal. I do not know what rent Australia Post will be paying in Westfield, because nobody from the corporation will tell me, and the Minister will not tell me. However, I find it difficult to accept that any rental honeymoon deal in Westfield could be more advantageous to Australia Post than staying where it is.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         First, Australia Post has to pay two other sets of rent, and sooner or later the Westfield rent will come on stream when the honeymoon is over. The rental in the present premises is nil. Still, I should not forget that there is an opportunity cost in tying up capital in owned premises. It is better, Australia Post tells me, to sell the current premises, gain a tax advantage on the rent paid, and invest the gains in property elsewhere.

         There are only two problems with that contention. Firstly, conventional wisdom has it that it is unwise to sell a suburban commercial property in the midst of a property downturn. The return has to be low, particularly as Australia Post is denying itself its one big property advantageâ€”its own tenancy. Secondly, Australia Post tells me that the proceeds of the sale are to be skimmed off from Liverpool. In other words, Liverpool does not even receive the benefits of the proceeds.

         What makes me cranky about the Liverpool post office is that I was not given the opportunity to comment on the plans before they went ahead, as indeed other community leaders were not. That is hardly good community relations. Although the people of Liverpool now believe that the city should be renamed `Westfield Junction', I do not consider this matter over yet. I will have more to say about it in the weeks ahead. Australia Post must produce the documentation to show that it has made a wise decision, rather than done a good deal with a powerful business. I am thankful that when I was in business I did not have the people who are running the post office running my business, because I would be bankrupt.

         â€”Before I continue on the matter I have raised in the adjournment debate this week on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and now on Thursday night on people with disabilities in South Australia, I would like to address some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford). I think she failed to mention that the study was conducted by a relative of somebody who sits in the parliamentary Labor Party. Not only that, but there were certain omissions from that study. Although I believe the wholesale sales tax was deducted, there were no deductions made for the payroll tax, for the removal of the 26c per litre excise on petrol, nor other taxes that are presently there. I am sure that, if the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) rises to speak, she will add to those comments.

         Tonight I just want to conclude some of those comments I have made over the past week on people with disabilities. As I have done in the past, I would like to quote the very words in the letters I have received.

        When I heard Mr. Bruggemann, Chief Executive Officer of IDSC tell me of a lady who was dying (within about 2 weeks) asking him for accommodation for her family member so she could have peace of mind, I thought it was a case of `here's someone worse than you, shut up'. Two weeks after this lady died, accommodation had still not been found. That story always puts me in mind of the 80 year old man here in the Riverland expected to continue to care until he dies.

         â€”Tonight I would like to address the House on the subject of Australian youth and children. Since this Government came to office in 1983 there have been significant reforms and improvements introduced which have benefited our youth and were needed to address the inequalities brought about by sheer neglect over the many years of conservative governments. The ranting and raving of the Opposition on the issue of youth unemployment is nothing short of hypocrisy. It is very easy to be a knocker, but when it comes time for positive action the Opposition is left stranded in the starting blocks.

         Indeed, only today the Opposition spokesperson on employment and industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), said that he wished that Australia could go back to the days when there were dead-end jobs. He then went on to describe a dead-end job as a job that did not involve any kind of training. Comments like this do nothing for Australia's standing in the international community. If we were to go back to the so-called good old days, which the honourable member for Bennelong reminisces about, we would also be going back to year 12 retention rates of less than 30 per cent, of 50 per cent fewer university places, with those places being available going to those who could afford to study, or to a minute few who were able to get a scholarship. Do we abolish Austudy, which is a $1 billion-plus program, or the disadvantaged schools program?  Would we forgo Commonwealth assistance for our TAFE systems?

         I can remember the 1950s and the 1960s in my area of Port Adelaide. Believe me, they were far from being the golden era. To even contemplate a return to the so-called golden era is ludicrous. If we did, I do not think we would have to worry about having a republican debate because even the mother country, along with every other developed nation, would want to disown us.

         Given the background of the lack of Opposition policies on youth, it is no wonder that my colleagues on this side of the House get frustrated at times when they try to put forward positive policies and ideas for our youth.  No matter what the Opposition claims about youth unemployment, it is falseâ€”patently falseâ€”to claim that one in three teenagers is unemployed. It would be more correct if those opposite said that one-third of the full time youth labour force was unemployed. As a total of the youth population, the number of young people who are unemployed is 9.7 per cent. That equates to 70 per cent who are in education, 20 per cent who are in employment and under 10 per cent who are unemployed. Let us not forget that the majority of that 10 per cent is without skills or any kind of training, vying for the so-called dead-end jobs that the honourable member for Bennelong refers to.

         I point out that I am not saying for one minute that youth unemployment in this country at its present level is acceptable. Of course, it is not. But this country needs some vision, ideals and some national pride in itself. We can do well without the knockers or the naive romantics. Youth are the future of this country. They are the ones who will need to support the growing number of elderly people in years to come. Without the skills and qualifications, our standard of living will not even be able to be maintained, let alone increased.

         We need to give our young the care, nurturing and encouragement they deserve. Historically there has been a lack of emphasis placed on children and youth in Australia. In a previous speech I referred to a quote by the Reverend Ted Noffs, founder of the Life Education Centres in 1974. In relation to drug abuse, he said:

        . . . after ten years of never ceasing crisis counselling on drug and related abuse . . . that nothing would be ultimately achieved if the situation continued to be tackled solely at the dire and desperate end of the road stage, and that breakthrough of a positive, lasting quality could only come through preventative education of all young children from about four and a half to twelve years of age.

         A few of us in this Parliamentâ€”I admit, on both sidesâ€”do understand that that is needed, but it has been a long slow battle to get that recognition. That is why I would like to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) for his suggested terms of reference for an inquiry into this area to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This inquiry covers the following areas:  the range and effectiveness of current methods to identify children at risk of developing literacy problems at an early age; addressing literacy; and the role of the Commonwealth disadvantaged schools program.

         I believe that early intervention strategies are the key to resolving many of our problems today, and as a member of that Committee, I am looking forward to some watershed changes being recommended to our education system. If the Opposition wants to get fair dinkum about the problems of youth and children, supporting the overall thrust of this Committee would be a positive step in the right direction.

In that case I will simply make some responses to the reference by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) to the remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) about dead-end jobs and point out to the honourable member that, in fact, the honourable member for Bennelong was comparing the situation of having a job which may be regarded as a dead-end job with the situation that has been wrought by this Government of 800,000 Australians not having a job at all. If he went out and asked those 800,000 Australians whether they would prefer to have some job, albeit a dead-end job as it may be described, compared to no job at all, I know what the resounding response would be.

        Under the Education Assistance Scheme members who undertake full time courses recognised under the terms of the AUSTUDY Scheme may be paid an amount equal to the difference between the annual Commitment Bonus and the AUSTUDY adult independent rate. This amount is tax exempt. Alternatively, members may choose the Job Search Assistance Scheme, which will be provided on completion of full time training, or, in the case of permanent force or general reserve transferees, on their transfer to the Ready Reserve. The Job Search Assistance Scheme is limited to a maximum of $1,000 per member. In addition appropriate job search counselling will be provided during full time training.
