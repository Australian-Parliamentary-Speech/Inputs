                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On coming to government, we started a journey towards a universal early learning system that was simple, affordable and accessible for every family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This three-day guarantee is a critical step on that journey. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We came into government in 2022 with a commitment to make early childhood education and care more affordable through our cheaper childcare programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We quickly turned that commitment into progress with more than a million families benefiting from these changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent data shows that an Australian family on an income of $120,000 a year paying the average quarterly fee for 30 hours child care per week has saved approximately $2,768 since September 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Productivity Commission to each do a review, providing guidance on how we can achieve our vision of a universal early learning system, a system where every child, no matter who they are, no matter their background and no matter where they live, has access to quality early childhood education and care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission inquiry in its interim report told us that the early childhood education workforce should be the first priority for reform, including through better pay and conditions. The Productivity Commission made it crystal clear that the workforce is fundamental in addressing any changes in availability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acted. Last year we passed our Wage Justice for Early Childhood Education and Care Workers (Special Account) Act 2024, supporting a 15 per cent pay rise for early childhood education and care workers increasing the wages of up to 200,000 early educators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Significant, momentous, historic, a monumental moment', 'proof that early learning matters' and 'life changing'—these are just some of the descriptive words that early childhood education advocates and workers have used to describe this government's 15 per cent wage increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the foundation of a universal system relies on a stable, secure and valued workforce. This wage rise will help achieve that by retaining our existing early childhood educators and attracting new workers to the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent Jobs and Skills Australia data indicates that workforce vacancy rates in the early childhood education and care sector having plummeted over the last 12 months, with internet vacancy rates down 22 per cent since December 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not all—the wage rise is linked to caps on fees. For providers to be eligible, they must not increase their fees by 4.4 per cent in the first year and 4.2 per cent in the second year. This is putting wages up for workers and keeping costs down for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 2½ years, we have made significant progress in building these foundations for a universal early childhood education and care system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know there is still more work to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry recommended that government consider 'removing, relaxing or substantially reconfiguring the current activity test'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their final report, the Productivity Commission recommended that all families who choose to use early childhood education and care should be able to access at least 30 hours or three days a week of high-quality early learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission noted that ensuring 'that all children aged zero to five years have access to some form of high-quality subsidised ECEC for at least three days a week (30 hours) for 48 weeks per year would accommodate the needs of families and the benefits for children from ECEC participation'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is again acting in introducing the Early Childhood Education and Care (Three Day Guarantee) Bill, guaranteeing families at least 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The three-day guarantee is about making sure that every child can have the best start in life—that all children are ready to learn, and ready to start school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about making sure that every child no matter their background and no matter where they live, has access to the transformative benefits of early childhood education and care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how precious the first five years of a child's life are; it is a time of extraordinary growth, of emotional and intellectual development. In these years, children learn foundational skills, learn to socialise, and develop emotional skills that they then build on when they start school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Replacing the Liberals' activity test, which locked out children and families, with Labor's three-day guarantee is such a crucial step in delivering on our commitment to universal early learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Liberals introduced the childcare subsidy activity test in 2018 they stated it was designed to encourage workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But as Thrive by Five's Jay Weatherill states: 'The activity test was intended to encourage parents into work but in fact it has done the opposite. It has limited choices and made it harder for parents—especially single parents—to make an income.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An evaluation by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found no evidence that the introduction of the activity test caused any increase in workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Productivity Commission found that the effects of the activity test on workforce participation were ambiguous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the activity test has made early learning harder to access for many families, including disproportionately affecting those families that may be experiencing disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families and advocates echoed these sentiments. Georgie Dent, CEO of the Parenthood, described the current activity test as 'a barrier that disproportionately locks out children who stand to benefit the most from participating in quality early childhood education and care'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The children who benefit the most from high-quality early education and care but right now, they're the least likely to attend. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, only 54 per cent of children in the most disadvantaged areas were enrolled in early childhood education and care. This compared with 76 per cent of children in the highest socioeconomic areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These same children are more likely to be developmentally vulnerable. The most recent Australian Early Development Census report found only 42.7 per cent of children experiencing the highest level of socioeconomic disadvantage were developmentally on track upon starting school, compared with 54.8 per cent of all children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the three-day guarantee is so important. High-quality education and care provides the opportunity to improve a child's lifelong trajectory. It should be an accessible, affordable option for every family, especially disadvantaged families. There should be no barriers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will mean real cost-of-living relief for 66,700 families, in the first year alone. Families will save an average of $1,370 per year and about half of these families earn less than $100,000 per year. Lower-income families will save more, an average of $1,460 per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also means that over 100,000 families can get more subsidised hours of early childhood education and care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is helping parents get back into the workforce and giving meaningful support to families struggling with the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also provides more support for families with First Nations children. We have already introduced changes that provide these families at least 36 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. This bill will raise that to 100 hours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are based on robust consultation with First Nations communities and organisations, and it's based on the evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, only 34 per cent of First Nations children are developmentally on track when they start school. Our changes will make high quality and culturally responsive early childhood education and care more accessible for First Nations children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will have life changing effects on First nations children and their families, SNAICC CEO Catherine Liddle has said: </span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability support pension—the DSP—has different rates for recipients aged under 21, depending on their circumstances, including their family situation. This includes a single dependent living at home rate, and a higher independent rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reflects the long-established policy position that higher rates of payment should be targeted to those with greater need, such as those living independently or away from home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These technical amendments are necessary as a recent merits review decision highlighted an unintended consequence of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Act 2005.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That act introduced the partial capacity to work rule 'independence' criteria for youth allowance recipients. The accompanying explanatory memorandum indicates that this was intended to apply to youth allowance recipients only.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not the objective of the partial capacity to work independence amendments to affect the DSP, which is a completely different payment category. Or that the amendments would affect the rate of payment a DSP recipient receives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as a result of the merits review outcome, it is now understood that a drafting error in the amendments made in 2005 means that certain DSP recipients under 21 are impacted. This, in turn, affected the rates of support those recipients are entitled to receive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes technical changes to provide for the intended different rates of payment for DSP youth recipients, based on their circumstances, including their family situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those young people who are assessed as independent, or needing to live away from home, it is appropriate that they receive a higher level of financial support from government, recognising their circumstances and need for additional assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, without this bill, there would be a distinction between DSP rates for youth recipients based on whether they are undertaking full-time study or are a new apprentice. They would receive a lower rate of support than other youth DSP recipients, meaning there would be a perverse incentive for young people with disability to stop studying to receive the higher independent rate of payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would be at odds with the priorities of Australia's Disability Strategy which includes providing support to people with disability to achieve their full potential through education and learning. To leave the legislation unchanged would undermine this priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also validate past rate decisions consistent with this longstanding policy. </span>

There has been a review. It has found a potential problem in insurance. You can get a house through the Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme, under DVA, and DVA acts as the agent. QBE does the insurance, but DVA is the agent. Technically we don't know whether they're allowed to do that, so we've just got to try and fix this up. I've had discussions with the minister. I appreciate that correspondence. I think it is best for us to expedite this. Why? We have had a massive flood around Townsville. There are a lot of people there who have DVA housing. I'm absolutely certain they want to make sure that, at this point in time, their house is insured.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:27</span>):  The Albanese government is committed to investing in the skills Australia needs to drive economic growth. Our Free TAFE Bill offers greater certainty to students, employers and industry, and commits the Commonwealth to ongoing support to states and territories for free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regional areas like Gilmore, so many kids want to finish school and gain an apprenticeship or train at their local TAFE. Many don't want to leave home and move to the city to find work or go to uni. They are salt-of-the-earth kids. They've grown up in small coastal towns, and often they want to work hard and follow in the footsteps of their parents, grandparents and siblings, whether that's working as a tradie, a nurse or an early educator. I am so pleased that more than 4,400 students took up free TAFE in my electorate last year. That's school leavers, mums, dads and older people retraining and getting ahead without putting added financial pressure on their family. I've been on the ground and walking the streets, talking with local apprentices, employers and TAFE students to hear about how and why they chose an apprenticeship, and how fee-free TAFE is helping them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in November I visited the Nowra TAFE campus with the Acting Prime Minister. We went into electrical and carpentry classes. We spoke with students and heard how fee-free TAFE is providing that bit of important financial relief for students and their families. These classes are booming at Nowra—training our tradies of the future—thanks to free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October I joined the Minister for Skills and Training to meet with twins Najara and Harrisen, both first-year motor mechanic apprentices at Batemans Bay. The 17-year-old siblings are being trained under the watchful eye of their father, Mark, the owner and director of Batemans Bay Automotive Repairs, who boast more than 20 years experience in the trade. The small family business has been employing and upskilling five apprentices since 2015, providing job opportunities for young people in our region. It was also really great to see this business employing women in a historically male dominated trade. Najara is working in a priority cohort, and has improved access to flexible, safe and inclusive training and work opportunities, which is just fantastic. I could see how passionate she was about cars, and it was great to see her interest in learning more about electric vehicles too. The pair travel to Nowra TAFE once a week and work in a workshop equipped with up-to-date scanning, diagnostic and programming tools for all modern vehicles. They are looking forward to one day taking the helm of their family business, and I'm delighted that TAFE is providing them with the variety of skills needed to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the visit we also met with Robert Beattie, the owner of Beach House Stairs at Batemans Bay and a huge supporter of young people and TAFE. You could say Robert knows a bit about training young people, having employed an incredible 45 apprentice carpenters at his business over the past 38 years. It was really great to talk with him, as well as his three current apprentices, about the importance of building the skills and talent in the Australian workforce to meet current and future skills gaps. First-year carpentry apprentices Nathan and Nicholas and second-year apprentice Brendan said that, with no shortage of work in the building industry, they felt confident they had great careers ahead of them. Nathan, 17, from Moruya, said everyone in his family was a tradie, and he wanted to leave school and do hands-on work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was so amazing to learn that every one of Robert's employees completed their carpentry apprenticeship with his company. He said his staff could see that there was plenty of work on offer and were enthused by the potential earnings for tradespeople. Established in 1985, Beach House Stairs is a wonderful family business that builds custom designed staircases, timber handrails, balustrades and benchtops. Small businesses like these are committed to training our young people and helping them find their path to a secure future, and, under Labor, they have our support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see TAFE booming on the South Coast and the recent introduction of the TAFE Certificate II in Aeroskills, which is also fee free. The aeroskills course is providing our young people with a pathway to an exciting career as an avionics maintainer, to support defence industry jobs locally. We're a proud Navy town, home to HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, the fleet air arm, and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>, so it's really important that we have defence related TAFE courses on offer here to give local students an entry into the industry. Defence and defence industry are our biggest employers, and this aeroskills course will provide local students with an opportunity to fill in-demand roles, such as aircraft maintenance engineers and aircraft line maintenance workers. Through a mixture of theory and practical units, the new course will give students insight from industry experienced teachers to ensure that planes—and helicopters, of course—fly smoothly and safely. Students will gain practical experience and develop specialist skills to give them an advantage in the job market, including working on real aircraft components on a variety of aircraft and working safely and sustainably in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can clearly see that I have been on the ground, talking with students, employers and apprentices, and I can tell you free TAFE is going gangbusters in Gilmore. I have travelled from one end of my electorate to the other and listened to young people who are training at TAFE and listened to adults who are retraining and gaining new skills. I've been walking the streets of our villages and towns in Gilmore and talking with people who are reaping the real rewards of fee-free TAFE. I've spoken to builders who are under the pump, constructing hundreds of new homes in our fast-growing region. They are screaming out for tradies, from plasterers to brickies, roofers and more. We need to build more homes, we need more tradies and, to do that, we need to continue free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As hundreds of students prepare to commence another semester of TAFE in my electorate, including free TAFE courses, I am extremely disappointed that the opposition leader will not support our fee-free TAFE bill. The opposition are showing their absolute disregard for young people and families in regional communities like the South Coast and are completely out of touch with the needs of young Australians. The opposition leader and the Liberals will cut free TAFE funding, and Australians will pay more for TAFE. The opposition will take opportunities away from thousands of hardworking Australians who are getting the skills they need for the jobs they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have ripped the guts out of TAFE before, and they have made it clear they will do it again. Last time they were in government, we saw the damage that their disregard for the VET system and skilling Australians did. We can't risk the Liberals slashing pathways for workers to enter essential industries like health care, construction and tech again. We have a responsibility to help people here and now. We owe it to the next generation of Australians to build an economy that unlocks their talents and rewards their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That starts with equal access to education for every Australian, no matter their background or financial situation. Free TAFE is an investment in our future, and it's an investment in our people, ensuring all Australians have the skills and capacity to contribute to a thriving economy. The Liberals' failure to invest in skilling up our people will leave businesses stranded and Australians locked out of reaching their potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting vocational education and TAFE training is what Labor does. With high-quality skills and training, we are building a better Australia. A reliable and trusted VET sector is critical for our economy. Under the Liberals, you won't get that. They destroyed TAFE, and under the Liberals my local TAFE campuses looked like a ghost town, as classes were slashed and teachers sacked. I should know; I worked there for over 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite us saving ordinary Australians thousands on TAFE fees, the deputy opposition leader had the nerve to label free TAFE 'wasteful spending'. She says free TAFE isn't working. Well, I can tell you that the Liberals have got it very wrong, because under Labor my local TAFE campuses across Gilmore are thriving. There is a TAFE in nearly every community across Australia, and every community in Australia deserves access to great vocational education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Dutton's demolition of TAFE would mean housing and energy projects couldn't get off the ground because of skills shortages. Businesses would be forced to look overseas for workers instead of employing Australians here at home. Education should not be a privilege. A Labor government will always stand up for public education and local jobs. The Liberals cut $3 billion of funding from the VET system and TAFE, clearly demonstrating they didn't understand or value the importance of strong TAFEs in our local communities. More than a third of all the enrolments in free TAFE have been in regional and rural areas like Gilmore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public education runs through my veins, and TAFE holds a special place in my heart. I will always fight for public education and stand up against any efforts to undermine TAFE. There is a clear choice at this election. The opposition leader and the Liberals will cut free TAFE funding, and Australians will pay more for TAFE. Under the Albanese government, free TAFE is here to stay.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  I rise to support the Free TAFE Bill 2024. Vocational qualifications are an important part of the post-secondary education mix. However, completions of apprenticeships and traineeships have been in decline since hitting peaks in 2012 to 2014. This deeply concerns me. This decline did not occur in a vacuum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July 2012, commencement incentives for existing worker apprenticeships and traineeships not on the National Skills Needs List were introduced. In October 2012, additional commencement and completion incentives were removed—$4,000 for diplomas and advanced diplomas, except for aged care, child care and enrolled nursing, and $1,500 for part-time apprenticeships and traineeships. With these few examples, we're demonstrating that there's a direct correlation between vocational education and the incentives and participation. Quite simply, policy settings that incentivise commencements and completions work. We need more vocationally trained workers, and this bill does accommodate this need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support this bill, I think that there are improvements that we could make to help support employers, with particular attention on small business. Small businesses with less than 20 employees account for 97 per cent of all businesses in Australia. Many, if not most, of these businesses just don't have the cash flow, ability or even capacity to take on apprentices or trainees without additional assistance from the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who knows about small business in construction knows that, for those first couple of years, the apprentice costs the employer money, and that's money that the employer or small business—particularly if they're a sole trader—can't afford to cover. In the third year, the cost of the apprentice pretty much breaks even, and in the fourth year they start to be able to charge out a little bit more because, by the fourth year, a person tends to have a bit more autonomy and independence. However, they're still under the apprenticeship. They're still being guided. So, when we look at small businesses across Australia and we wonder why they're not taking them on, it's because of the cost. We are expecting small businesses to carry the load of training the next generation, whereas, if you go back 30 years, it was actually government that was the biggest apprentice trainer in Australia—certainly in South Australia. The South Australian government was the largest apprentice holder. It's not anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other support that I think small businesses and apprentices need is greater support in mentoring, providing that relationship and connecting a young apprentice—or indeed an adult apprentice—with a support network so that they continue their apprenticeship and that they complete their apprenticeship, because too many people take on an apprenticeship and only get to second or third year for a variety of reasons. In my visits around my electorate, this is a common discussion point among small businesses. They want to employ more trainees and apprentices, but the constraints that I mentioned previously stop them from doing so. I acknowledge that there are a number of programs that exist in this space, but I think we can do more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reviewing submissions to the government's Strategic Review of the Australian Apprenticeship Incentive System, I thought the recommendations of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry were particularly useful. They included the creation of a five-year job-creation incentive program with standard base-level payments to all employers of apprentices of up to $2,000 per quarter across the first two years for trainees and apprentices. These are targeted incentives for those areas that are deemed in shortage by the Jobs and Skills Australia—of an additional $2,000 payment above that standard base payment payable to employers, as well as completion payments of $2,500 once the apprentice or trainee completes their qualification payable to the employer and an additional amount of $3,000 to be payable quarterly across two years for an adult-age apprentice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about an adult-age apprentice, but, really, we're often talking about a young person, aged 22 or 23, who maybe got out of school and wasn't entirely sure what they were going to do. They might have worked in hospitality, fast food or whatever for those first couple of years and then think to themselves, 'Actually, I'd really like to take on an apprenticeship,' but, by age 21 or 22, that's an adult apprenticeship. It is not a traditional junior apprenticeship under junior apprenticeship wages. A lot of employers will not take on that 21- or 22-year-old, simply for the enormous cost for that small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My other concern relates to the cap on the numbers and how the smaller states like South Australia will fair in the carve-up of these places. I support this bill, and I call on the government to give careful consideration to the employer incentives for small businesses as I mentioned and the equitable allocation of places across our nation to ensure that states like my state of South Australia get their fair share.</span>

We are the party of education for all, and we absolutely understand the power of education and how it can change someone's life. What has become very clear through the debate and the discussion in this place around this bill is that the Liberals do not understand this. They do not understand that fundamental to governing this country is helping people to get the skills and training they need to build a good career to provide workers for those industries that our country needs for the future. The actions and the words we are seeing from those on the other side show that they do not value this work. They do not value our education and our training system. They certainly do not value free TAFE. They've been very upfront about that. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if you don't pay for something, you don't value it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The apprentices and trainees that I have met in local TAFEs in my community would disagree strongly with that statement. They do know that what they are doing at the moment is investing in their future and that what free TAFE gives them is the opportunity to do that—the opportunity to take up a career or a skillset that will last them for their lifetime. It is very clear this week that Labor is for helping Australians to get the skills to build their careers and our country. Of course, those opposite, the Liberals, are for taxpayers paying for bosses' lunch. It is a very clear contrast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this contrast directly in my community in the past. My local community knows all too well what the Liberal Party thinks about TAFE. Locals remember that it was the Liberals in Victoria who oversaw the closure of the Greensborough TAFE in 2013. The impact of that was huge in our local community. It took away this longstanding local training institution for people in the northern end of my electorate. It took the return of a Labor government to see the Greensborough campus reopen in 2017, followed by the opening on the same site of the Banyule Nillumbik Tech School in 2018. Once again, the work of the Labor government has meant that countless people in Jagajaga, whether it be young people or older people retraining for new skills, have had the opportunity to take up education and training through TAFE. That is a really practical demonstration in my community of the value that Labor governments put on this work and the complete disregard that those opposite have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased last week to visit Melbourne Polytechnic in Heidelberg West in my community. I visited with the Minister for Skills and Training. I have been there a number of times, and I always enjoy talking with the apprentices, the students and the staff training them about the work they are undertaking. There is a big focus at that campus on building trades in particular. I was really pleased to be visiting last week because the minister was making a very exciting announcement, which is that this government will deliver a $50 million future-of-housing-construction centre of excellence at Heidelberg West. I'm really proud that this centre will be located in Jagajaga and that we will be home to the first dedicated training facility in Australia that's focused exclusively on advanced construction courses. What that will mean is that those people training at this centre will get the most up-to-date training in the construction of houses, looking at things like how we build more houses more quickly with less environmental impact and new models like prefab and modular. It is really exciting work. So those people will get training and cutting-edge skills at the same time that we are helping to push along the construction of new houses, which we most desperately need in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is an example of how our government sees this investment in TAFE, this investment in helping people get the skills and training they need to build their future, as part of how we build our nation and do the work we need to do to build things like new houses and have people working in clean energy industries. This is nation-building work. I know in my electorate they are skills that in housing will be put to work locally in Heidelberg West, at places like Bell-Bardia, which is just up the road from Melbourne Polytechnic, where together with the Victorian government we're constructing 104 social and affordable homes with an investment of $27.5 million. That will be a big investment for my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all local students to have a look at the work that is happening at Melbourne Polytechnic—have a look at the opportunities that are there. It was fantastic speaking with a lot of the local students there about the experiences they are having through their apprenticeships and through their training. In the main, they were positive experiences, where they had found the blend of the practical work they were getting through their apprenticeships and the training was really useful, and they could see how that was setting them up for an excellent career to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I was at Melbourne Polytechnic I was also really pleased to meet Adam, a local who's been teaching plumbing to students there. Adam has a long history of working as a plumber, and he told me he had come to be teaching the profession so that he could give back to the next generation and help build that generation of workers we will need to continue to do this work. It was really great to talk to Adam about what he's getting out of teaching these skills, and as a government we absolutely want to encourage people to look at the option of teaching skills training and being part of the training workforce. We recognise, particularly in these types of construction trades, there may be older people who have worked for some time in the industry and are now perhaps looking to not to be on the tools all day every day, for the other opportunities that teaching provides and, as I said, to be able to give back the community. With teachers like Adam working in our local community I am confident that our local plumbing industry, our local plumbing apprentices and the future of construction in our local area are in good hands. I'm very pleased to see that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area that I'm really pleased and encouraged to see growth in through the investment this government has been making in free TAFE is the opportunities it is providing for Australian women. Free TAFE has allowed women to take up opportunities that otherwise are hard to come by. We do know that six in 10 learners in free TAFE are women, and they're doing courses like nursing, cybersecurity, carpentry, mental health and early childhood education. I have spoken with a number of these women, including some who are taking some of the different pathways into construction apprenticeships, and they all talk about how much they appreciate the opportunity, how they really understand that this is setting them up to further their career and how they really value the skills that they have been able to gain as a result of free TAFE. These are all opportunities that would be taken away from Australian women under those opposite, who do not support free TAFE. These women would not have the opportunity to study, to grow their skill set and to grow their future prosperity and the prosperity of their families and our country under those opposite, who, for ideological reasons, are standing against this government's work to make free TAFE permanent in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the flow-ons from Australian women being able to take up those training opportunities, we know we are already seeing positive results for women in the workforce. The latest data from the ABS tells us we are fast approaching seven million Australian women having jobs. The December 2024 data tells we've got more than six million Australian women with jobs. The vast majority of growth in women's jobs has been in full-time work—84 per cent of all new women's jobs—with the number of women in full-time work now reaching a record high of almost four million. That is impressive growth in that time, and we will see that continue as we see Australian women able to take up the opportunities that free TAFE provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is a given. This is the work of Labor governments—to provide people with the opportunity that comes from education and to broaden that opportunity so that all Australians have the opportunity to take up a training, a skill and a career in an area that both works for them and contributes to our national prosperity and our national growth. Whether it is through a construction trade at Melbourne Polytechnic in Heidelberg West, where they're studying carpentry and plumbing and where they will be building the houses that we need to overcome our housing shortage in Australia, or it's studying a healthcare science or early childhood education, providing the workforce we need in those care industries, these are the opportunities that Labor is providing from free TAFE. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all we get from those opposite, once again, is an attempt to shut down these opportunities for Australians. Those opposite have very clearly said that they do not support this bill. They have suggested that, in fact, those who are taking up this opportunity do not value the opportunity. I really would encourage those opposite to get out and meet some of these apprentices and students who are doing this training. I can assure you that every single one I have met really appreciates the opportunity they are getting to set themselves up for the future, and that includes young people who are training for the first time. It includes older people who are retraining to extend their time in the workforce. It includes Australian women who are getting opportunities that they have not had before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we contrast the approach of this government, which is investing in these people to build their skills, to build their future and to have a career that is lasting and meaningful, with the approach of those opposite, which is both to deny that opportunity—to be very clear that they do not support that opportunity for people to get ahead in Australia—and, at the same time, to say that what they do support is Australian taxpayers funding a long lunch for bosses, which is actually outrageous, we get a very clear indication of the choice that will be before the Australian people when we go to ask them to support this government at an election. It is a very clear indication of this government's priorities: building Australia's future, making sure that all Australians can access that prosperity and giving young people and older people in my community the opportunity to gain the skills that will set them up for their future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  Australia has a significant skills shortage, and it's getting worse. In 2023, Jobs and Skills Australia estimated that 36 per cent of occupations were in shortage, five percentage points higher than in 2022. We desperately need to attract more people to critical services like aged care, health care, child care and construction to ensure the ongoing affordability and quality of the services we rely on. As I mentioned, we desperately need more construction workers, and to be training more construction workers, to alleviate the current housing shortage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finding ways to get more people trained is absolutely essential, and I strongly support initiatives that make a real difference to getting people trained up in the services that we really need. Anecdotally, I've also heard, for example, that the ability to access free TAFE is helping students, particularly those from disadvantaged cohorts that may not otherwise be able to skill and train, and I think that is really important. However, the impact appears to be at the margins, as we would expect. We know for the higher education system and poorly designed Job-ready Graduates scheme that fees play a smaller role than we might think in determining what professions people take up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the VET and higher education systems are different and that fees really do impact individual courses, but I think there are broader reasons why these industries are in shortage that are not addressed by this bill, and perhaps they should be. Free TAFE might be a good initiative—it might be—but it is expensive and, if it is not addressing the root causes, then perhaps the money could be better deployed. So my question really is: do we need to commit to this policy right now, when the current policy doesn't expire for another two years, and when we don't have the data or the information to consider whether it should be permanently implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do worry, I'll be honest, that this bill is politics over policy, signing up a future government to a commitment that looks good for an election now. The purpose of this bill is to provide for ongoing financial support to the states and territories for the delivery of free TAFE and vocational education and training places to ensure that people continue and complete their degrees. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website currently states that the government and the states have partnered to deliver over $1.5 billion worth of funding for 500,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places over 2023 to 2026. The current program expires in 2026, with a new scheme to take effect in January 2027.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I acknowledge the government wants to provide certainty to the sector, historically, two years notice is not the standard notice in government given to the sector over other substantial pieces of legislation. Just a few months ago, the government was arguing for changes to international students, with less than six months notice for the universities to implement that timeframe. Two years notice seems luxurious in comparison, so I don't buy that this is the underlying reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data on the scheme is a point of contention. I know completions is a blunt measure, but I am concerned that we do not yet have the information currently to put it into a permanent scheme. Again, anecdotally, because the data is so poor, I understand that the attrition in the sector is driven by poor-quality pay and conditions in jobs and apprenticeships that graduates participate in. I note that there is a review under way on this issue, with apprenticeships covering the topic of attrition and declining completions in apprenticeships. Given that all of these are interconnected, I think it would have been prudent to wait for the final report, or, even better, we could have commissioned a review of fee-free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that free TAFE shows a commitment to addressing the skills shortages, supporting disadvantaged cohorts and boosting economic participation. I don't disagree with the intentions of the bill, and I believe that I could support a policy that looks to deliver free TAFE, but I do not understand the urgency to push this through right now. The current scheme is not expiring, and we do not yet have the data, at least in the public domain, nor has there been a proper review to make an informed decision about the outcomes of this bill and whether it is value for money for the outcomes we are seeking. I wonder if we could better achieve these goals and reduce attrition challenges by providing more targeted measures for marginal cohorts and using the others to improve the pay and conditions of the jobs that these trainees ultimately participate in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that I don't know the answer to these questions because we don't yet have the data, but without the evidence I find it really difficult to support a piece of legislation that is not urgent. But, hey, there's an election soon, so I guess that explains the urgency.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I rise today to wholeheartedly support this important bill. The Free TAFE Bill locks in fee-free TAFE as an enduring feature of Australia's vocational education and training system. The Albanese government is guided by a simple principle: no-one held back, no-one left behind. Whether you're a student in Nundah, a tradie in Boondall or a parent in Stafford, you deserve the opportunity to build a good life for yourself and your family. Labor believes that opening the door to these opportunities starts with education. Education is the most powerful tool we have to overcome disadvantage or retrain for a better paid, more secure job. It is the best investment we can deliver to build a future made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next decade, nine out of 10 new jobs will require post-secondary qualifications, and almost half of those qualifications will need to come through vocational education and training pathways like TAFE. Labor's fee-free TAFE ensures that Australians are developing the skills they need to pursue a career in the trades and sectors that we need them in—more tradies to build more homes; more fabricators to restore our sovereign manufacturing capability; more ICT experts to harness the potential of the booming global digital economy; and more skilled carers to look after our loved ones in the aged care, early education and the disability sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Free TAFE Bill builds on Labor's extensive work to reverse a decade of coalition neglect and rebuild TAFE for communities across Australia. In the first two years of fee-free TAFE, we have seen almost 508,000 enrolments. Of those enrolments, 131,000 have been in aged care and disability support; 48,900 have been in digital and tech; 35,000 have been in construction; and 35,500 have been in early childhood education. Fee-free TAFE is particularly benefiting Australians in typically vulnerable cohorts, including 170,000 young Australians, 124,000 jobseekers and 30,000 First Nations Australians. Of all places, six in 10 have been taken up by women and one in three in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what fee-free TAFE is about: removing financial barriers to education and training to deliver a more prosperous and equitable Australia. Removing the financial barriers to starting TAFE is providing real cost-of-living relief and saving Australians thousands of dollars. A student in Zillmere training in the Diploma of Nursing can save up to $16,000. A student studying a certificate III in early childhood education in Taigum can save up to $1,000. And a student in Chermside who is undergoing a certificate IV in cybersecurity can save up to $8,000. That is a significant amount of money that they can put into their savings account for a house deposit or a rainy day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE is a proud Australian story. It's a story about aspiration, about the pursuit of passion, about the gratification of hard work and about the satisfaction that can be found in achieving your goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Lilley and the Minister for Aged Care, I have had the privilege of hearing these stories firsthand. Mackenzie, whom I first met at her school leadership ceremony at Earnshaw State College in 2020, is now doing a Diploma of Nursing at the South Bank TAFE, and I couldn't be prouder of her. Nahid was a software engineer but decided to go and do a certificate III at the Canberra Institute of Technology because she wants to work with people, not mechanics. Ylizbeth, one of the most passionate aged-care workers whom I have met so far, is upskilling through fee-free TAFE to become an enrolled nurse, with the goal of one day becoming a registered nurse and then a doctor. Good luck, Ylizbeth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as the Albanese government makes strides towards building a world-class VET system that is high quality and that is accessible, the coalition wait with bated breath to tear it all down. Whether it's TAFE, university, schooling or early education, the coalition have made it very clear how they feel about affordable and accessible education: they're against fee-free TAFE, they're against student debt relief and they're against affordable early education. They believe education is a privilege that should be paid for. When they were in government, they exacerbated education inequality by cutting $3 billion from the VET sector and they made it more expensive to go to uni. Given half a chance, they will do it again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By investing in fee-free TAFE, Labor is sending a clear message to each and every person who is unsure about their future: we trust your aspirations, we support your education, we back you and we will always work to ensure the doors of opportunity are open for you. That is what Labor governments do. We help people under pressure and we build for the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="124514" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Free TAFE Bill 2024, disingenuously titled as the bill appears to be unfunded. So we can't be so sure about the free bit, and we are none the wiser in relation to the 'who will be paying for it' bit as well. I can tell you who probably will be paying in terms of worse outcomes, wasted endeavour and unmet skill needs: the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the risk of enormously wasted talent. Labor's own talking points on TAFE include that, of the 500,000 enrolments in so-called fee-free TAFE, only 13 per cent have so far resulted in a completed qualification, which means 87 per cent are yet to complete or have dropped out. Last year the South Australian skills minister let the cat out of the bag, providing evidence to the South Australian parliament in late October that the dropout rate for fee-free TAFE was around 13 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The detail of the bill, of course, reveals what we already know—a free TAFE place is not exactly free. A free TAFE place 'may not be free of all fees'. You'll find that in the small print—part 1, clause 5, 'Definitions', 'FT place'. This is what the bill says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">FT place</span> means a free place in a course at a TAFE institution or a course provided by another VET provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's a note in smaller print:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An FT place may not be free of all fees. The fees covered will depend on the terms and conditions of the relevant FT agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, according to their own provisions, the free TAFE place may not in fact be free, or indeed, according to this provision of the bill, it may not even be at a TAFE. George Orwell would be so proud of this one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, together with the Prime Minister's recent announcements regarding apprentices, shows you just how much vocational education is an afterthought for this Albanese government. We heard it yesterday in question time—university, university, university; cuts to HECS fees for current debt-holding university students or graduates. Yes, let's make all the tradies pay to wipe 20 per cent off a first-year lawyer's HECS debt. Lovely! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost no-one in Labor has run a business—certainly no business which requires vocational and training skills. It's obvious in all of their policy settings. If they had, they would see the devastating effect this measure in this bill is having on choice, both for employers and future employees, as well as on the quality and quantity of graduates in precisely the skill groups and trades that this country desperately needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a local example of the chaos this kind of measure is making in my community. Just before Christmas I went to visit Sharyn. Sharyn runs a private training organisation just over the boundary of my electorate, and I visited her RTO, Nepean Industry Edge Training, a couple of times to talk to her students and to understand what guides their career choices and their hopes for the future. But, just before Christmas, Sharyn called my office in a state of panic. She was distressed because of an announcement made by the Victorian government regarding changes to their Skills First funding program that changed which qualifications would be subsidised by the Victorian government to meet Victorian skill needs, the number of funded places available and the subsidy amounts to support students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sharyn was told that, overnight, funded places for her training organisation, NIET, would go from 180 to no more than 50, even though she had in place a two-year contract with the Victorian government which had allowed her to invest in upskilling her staff and to purchase new training equipment for students' needs. For the previous decade this training organisation, NIET, had had a thousand funded places, so the drop-off from the previous year had already been financially challenging. But this overnight change would in fact be devastating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sharyn was also summarily advised that the amount of money the Victorian government offered per student would be reduced by 35 per cent. Even for students who had been enrolled in 2024, there was no grandfathering under the funding agreement which had been on foot, and they were still completing their courses in 2025. This change in funding would occur overnight. Sharyn, at the time of receiving this advice, had 180 places offered to support students in the individual support, early childhood and ageing support industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to step back for a minute and think about what is actually happening here. Each year, under this program, NIET provided qualified, job-ready graduates to disability services, child care and aged-care facilities across my electorate. It equally provides high-quality skilled people in hospitality and tourism—the stuff the Mornington Peninsula thrives on. But overnight the Victorian government had made this business unviable. Why? Because a broke Victorian government wanted to pass the buck to the Commonwealth, citing the illusion of free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for the peninsula? It means the loss of hundreds of urgently needed staff. What does it mean for NIET and for local employment in Frankston? NIET has to lay off six permanent and 15 casual staff. This move, literally on the eve of Christmas last year, threw NIET's students into limbo, and two weeks notice was given. NIET tried to facilitate transition to the nearby TAFE, but it was already at capacity. Students accustomed to small, tailored and flexible classes at NIET were told that TAFE class sizes were capped at 17 to 20 per group, with classes held three days a week—always during business hours—with two days being taught online, even though they are local students and learning to care for disabled and elderly people, which is a hands-on, face-to-face, practical role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with Sharyn in December, she was bereft. Her team were struggling to hold back tears as they spoke to me about what this might mean for their students. NIET is a family place where middle-aged women, in particular, returning to education and training after raising children or getting back on their feet after a separation have found peace, purpose and a sense of family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sharyn and her team were desperately trying to find a way to work with their students to get them to qualify before she had to exit the NIET premises. Over Christmas, Sharyn and her colleagues developed a plan for those students. She needs to find a replacement tenant for the premises on which NIET has a five-year lease, so she's going to operate for the next six months. She'll run at a loss to do this to make sure that her students get to finish their qualification. Their only alternative was to do nothing until the end of April and then try and enrol in TAFE in its next incoming cohort, on 29 April. Six months from now, the Mornington Peninsula will have lost the potential for hundreds of graduates that would have been picked up by so many businesses in desperate need of quality staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is currently a waiting list of 6,000 individuals for care packages in Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula. NIET has over time been a reliable supplier of high-quality and job-ready aged-care staff to Australian Unity in Mornington and AutumnCare in Frankston and Mornington and provides ongoing training to around 250 disability support workers employed by Focus Individualised Support Services, who are based in Mornington at the Coolstores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NIET also provides ongoing medications training to PCAs in aged-care centres and to disability support workers. Sharyn's employers often comment on her students. They stand out during placement because they've been taught the soft skills of communication and to be proactive and person centred carers. They've also got confidence in using equipment such as lifting machines and in giving dignity to clients when providing personal care such as showering and toileting. Many students they get from other training organisations haven't used any of this equipment before, and NIET students have had to teach them on the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are aged-care facilities on the Mornington Peninsula which cannot operate at full capacity at the moment because they lack the qualified aged-care workers they need. Sharyn told me of people in similar positions to her who have had to do some of the hardest months of their life over the Christmas break, reconciling with the debt and the administration left to them by this overnight change from the Victorian government and the skills deficit their communities will be confronted with, all while listening to Labor cry 'fee-free TAFE', which, by the way, was never free. Just the materials at the nearby TAFE were more expensive than what NIET was charging many of its students. Indeed, the students who looked to transfer to TAFE under NIET when it lost its Victorian government funding found they were all going to have to pay $460 at the fee-free TAFE, whereas at NIET, at their actual course, it was free because it had been subsidised under this Victorian government program now abolished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the performance of TAFE under this government, it is a good idea to look at some facts. TAFE numbers are lower than they were under the coalition. In fact, the year the Albanese government introduced free TAFE, 2023, was also the year that saw nearly record-low enrolments—since 2020. I'm not here to condemn TAFE as an institution in any way. I love TAFE. I was once a TAFE student. I have the most extraordinary, high-potential TAFE in Rosebud, in my electorate. It's the only tertiary institution we have, even though technically we're meant to be metropolitan Melbourne. It's just that no-one has invested in it for years, so our young people tend to be drawn towards the shiny new facilities in Frankston or, worse, up the freeway in the city to take up the 'university, university, university' pressure that their peers, parents and, indeed, this government constantly puts on their shoulders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected, I have been in constant contact with our local TAFE and vocational education providers. I set up a hospitality roundtable which is now maintained and sustained by the sector itself. Chisholm TAFE, local employers, employment agencies, the private RTOs and the shire: we all get together and talk about what is needed to keep our kids learning and working on the peninsula. But it always comes back to the same issue—the lack of state government funded public transport. There's no point to a TAFE down the road in the industrial estate in Rosebud if no-one can get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also raised concerns about attitudes to trades and trades training even though Flinders is a trading hotspot. We have the second highest number of trade professions of any electorate in the country. You can't blame tradies for wanting to be on the Mornington Peninsula. It's paradise. A vibrant, skills based tertiary system is what will sustain Australia's economy in the 21st century. There is enormous demand for skills in construction, the care economy and agriculture. We need to train as many people as possible and provide the best public policy settings to ensure that most people can get the education to meet the country's needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the answer is not one-size-fits-all TAFE; it's in choice and flexibility. This chamber may need some reminding about the coalition's commitment to vocational education. I had the honour of working with Brendan Nelson when he was education minister in 2004, which some of you with long memories will know was the year of the 'trades election'. I had been Nelson's vocational education adviser since the year prior, and I was laser focused on how to increase uptake in trade training and how to make apprentices and trainees feel appreciated by the Australian population, valued, recognised and respected for their choice. Our commitments to vocational education at the 2004 election were based in the heart of liberal values. In his speech to formally launch the Liberal Party's campaign in September 2004, John Howard said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's a golden thread that runs through so many Coalition policies and that is that great principle of choice. Greater choice for families to choose how they will balance their work and their family responsibilities. Greater choice for entrepreneurial Australians to start and expand their small business. Greater choice and opportunity for young Australians to develop their talents to the full. And importantly, greater choice for Australian parents to decide how and where their children will be educated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does that sound familiar? It should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further in that speech, John Howard went on to describe what the coalition's policy on vocational education was going to be. He reflected:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is facing a national skills shortage in traditional trades such as carpenters, welders, auto-electricians, motor mechanics, brick layers, chefs and hairdressers. This is in part a product of our great economic success. It's also the legacy of some bad decisions we made a generation or more ago. This country made a big mistake 30 or 40 years ago when it turned its back on the old system of having technical skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to talk about the importance of those technical skills and then to announce a raft of policies to address the skills deficit we were facing. He talked about our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training. He announced the 24 Australian technical colleges that we would establish to accelerate national skills development in traditional trades. He talked about where they would be located, from Darwin to Northern Tasmania, Adelaide, Perth and here in Queensland. May I say, two of those survived their de-creation, or their abolition—should I call it that?—by the Rudd government, and they're both in Adelaide. They're run by the Catholic Education Office, and they're great. He announced the introduction of Commonwealth scholarships for new apprentices in priority trades after their first and second year of apprenticeship. He announced an intention to extend youth allowance to apprentices, putting them on the same footing as university students. He also announced $100 million to build an Australian network of industry careers advisers to make sure that, when students went to advisers to ask what they might do in the future, trades were kept front and centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must do more to encourage them—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why I'm especially pleased to announce a series of measures at furthering entrenching the enterprise culture within this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister went on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know these measures like the back of my hand because I'm the bunny who wrote that policy for the 2004 election. It was the election when you'd see John Howard walking around, quite often with a hammer in his hand, just to constantly reinforce the message: 'We appreciate your choice of an Australian trade qualification. We need you to choose more, and we need to back you in.' That's what a Peter Dutton government will do if given the chance—back in the trades and get us back on track.</span>

I'm actually very fond of the member for Flinders. I don't want to jinx you. I don't want to jinx you on your side. This is not a doxxing. But I've actually used you as an example in a conversation that I put on the public record only last week. The fact that you're on the back bench after such an accomplished speech, a professional woman who has actually been interested in public policy, and people like the chap here are on the frontbench says everything that's wrong about the modern Liberal Party—when someone of your intellect and contribution over decades is sitting up there. But, anyway, there you go.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you—he called me a loser. Thanks. We'll put that on the record too. It says more about you than me. But it is surreal, isn't it? At least that was a reasoned contribution. Most of it had nothing to do with the Free TAFE Bill; it was about the Victorian government. Most of it was to do with state government policies on the trading sector, but there you go. But using a reasonable voice doesn't make reason from nonsense. We've had speaker after speaker from the opposition, from the Liberal and National parties, at least coming clean about the choice, or one aspect of the choice, that Australians will face at the coming election: the Liberals will cut free TAFE, and this Labor government will invest in free TAFE. This bill means that free TAFE is here to stay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a cost-of-living policy to lower the cost and lower the barriers, particularly for kids from the suburbs and regions like the place I represent in outer south-east Melbourne, to actually accessing skills and training and to provide that pathway into good, well-paid, secure, skilled jobs. But it's also smart economic policy. It is an investment in skills to drive our economic growth. It's critical. It's good for the economy. It's good for wages. It's good for employment. It's good for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also reduces reliance on migration. It's not rocket science that if you train more Australians and you don't do what they did over their wasted decade of decay and dysfunction, cutting billions from TAFE and the training and apprenticeships system, if you actually invest in training and skilling Australians, you reduce reliance on migration. That's what I'm up for. I'm up for giving Australians in the suburbs and the regions a chance at good, well-paid jobs by removing those barriers to them pursuing careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things about free TAFE is that it allows governments to incentivise students to choose the courses in the areas of skill shortage that the economy needs. Last week I was at Chisholm TAFE, which has campuses in Dandenong and Berwick in my electorate. It's absolutely fantastic talking to the free TAFE students in nursing, in manufacturing and in construction related trades who are actually getting a start. So it's a cost-of-living measure and an economic measure. For nursing, health care, construction, energy and technology, it provides pathways to good, secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians already. I think the latest data was that around 568,000 Australians in just 21 months have accessed free TAFE. That's just in the first 21 months. And it is a partnership with the state and territories. It's not some doctrine from Canberra. This legislation makes free TAFE permanent and sets up the policy architecture where then we negotiate individual partnerships with each state and territory that adapt to the training system and adapt to what local industry and business and the economy need, as it should. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd encourage the opposition to actually look at the evidence and support the bill, but I'm not holding my breath. Every now and again, Deputy Speaker Buchholz—you know those moments; you've been here a while—someone says something in the chamber or around the building that makes your head spin, and you go: 'What? Did she just say that?' That was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last year. She dropped the mask on free TAFE. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And remember this, and it's a key principle and tenet of the Liberal Party: if you don't pay for something, you don't value it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, she belled the cat on that one. It actually showed who they really are. When you take away all the nonsense language about aspiration that they like to parade, they're there for those who already have the most wealth in the country, and they hate universal services. That's been a consistent threat for decades with the Liberal and National parties. They don't believe in aspiration and, in particular, in supporting kids from lower socioeconomic circumstances, be it in the regions or the outer suburbs, to get a start in life, get skilled, get training and get into well-paid jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you take that Liberal philosophy of 'if you don't pay for something, you don't value it', it actually starts to make sense of their world view and other things. What if you take that to school education? 'If you don't pay for it, you don't value it.' I think most parents in Australia have a different view. What about firefighters? Taking that philosophy, if you want the firefighters to come and put out a fire at your house, why don't you pay for it? Otherwise, you won't value it. What about lifeguards at the beach, emergency departments in hospitals or GPs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was when the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, was health minister—you might remember that he was voted the worst health minister in 40 years by the doctors—that he implemented that philosophy, the one that they still espouse today, of 'if you don't pay for it, you don't value it'. He literally tried to destroy Medicare bulk-billing entirely by introducing a charge for every Australian to see the doctor. It wasn't just an accidental policy. It wasn't a budget measure. It was what they fundamentally believe. The Liberal and National parties' history is to fight against universal services. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was the Labor Party that fought, election after election, to try and introduce Medicare. You don't like this, but this is the history of your party. You fought election after election, opposing Medicare, opposing—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  Well, it's history. It's there. Malcolm Fraser abolished the first version of Medicare, and then you went to election after election with John Howard and Andrew Peacock and John Howard until you finally learnt the lesson that you couldn't win an election in this country without at least pretending to support Medicare. It's the same philosophy. That's what they believe: if you don't pay for it, you don't value it. We have a different view about universal services, and free TAFE is part of that. It's good for the economy and it's a cost-of-living measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing they've said about free TAFE is that it's 'wasteful spending'. There's an important clue here. One of the great mysteries that erupted outside this chamber last week was when the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We're going to make giant cuts to public services, but we're not going to tell you what they are until after the election—giant cuts, but we're keeping them a secret.' It's gaslighting the Australian people. It's trolling the Australian people. Never before in the history of our Westminster democracy has the alternative government been so disrespectful of Australians that they're actually saying, 'We're not going to tell you what we're going to do after the election; we're just going to make cuts.' That is $315 billion of secret cuts, 'but we'll tell you after the election'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg because they've got to find $600 billion to pay for their risky nuclear reactor fantasy, and goodness knows how much the long lunches are going to cost—somewhere between $1.6 billion and $10 billion. It depends on how many people go out and take the full $20,000 tax deduction on the taxpayer so Australian taxpayers will be paying for their bosses' long lunches. You can apparently go to lunch by yourself at the golf club and have a $10,000 lunch, and that's okay—but they don't support free TAFE. So it's an important clue. Skilling Australians is wasteful spending, according to the Liberal Party, but you've got to cut free TAFE to pay for your boss's long lunch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a different vision. Skills and TAFE are critical for the economy, for Australia's future and, as I said, for cost-of-living help right now. Let's put a couple of numbers on the record. Thousands of dollars are being saved by Australians right now from free TAFE. A student in Victoria studying the Diploma of Nursing can save up to $17,700. That's an enormous amount. We need more nurses. I want to see Australian nurses trained, as I said, so we can rely less on overseas skilled migration. If we want to see Australian nurses trained, this is a cost-of-living measure that incentivises it. Early childhood certificate III in South Australia—we need skilled early childhood workers. You're a paediatrician, Deputy Speaker Freelander; one of the smartest investments we can make in our future economic wealth is investing in good early childhood training. That is $4,400 saved, and that incentivises students into that. A certificate of agriculture in Queensland can save students $5,250. In the ACT, cybersecurity students—we have a massive cybersecurity workforce shortage in this country—can save $3½ thousand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at least the opposition is consistent; I'll give them that. They have been consistent this term in opposing cost-of-living help, because it's not just free TAFE; they opposed the tax cuts, spoke against—we were going to have an election, apparently, last year. They called for an election so that people could have a say on Labor's tax cuts for every taxpayer. They opposed cheaper medicines. They opposed the $300 energy rebate for every household. They opposed the caps on wholesale gas prices. They opposed cheaper child care—more wasteful spending, according to the opposition. They oppose free TAFE. In fact, along with free TAFE, if they'd had their way over the last 2½ years, every Australian household would be $7,200 worse off. That's the sum total of them saying no, no, no, no, no to every cost-of-living measure that the government has put forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's also consistent with their record in government in that wasted decade of decay, dysfunction and division. There were 22 energy policies. It ripped to bits three prime ministers. The Liberals presided in that decade over the second biggest skills shortage of any developed country in the OECD, and yet, despite all of the noise and the rhetoric, they still failed to land a national agreement with the states and territories to build Australia's skill base. There was an absolute crisis in skills, construction and trades—a 50 per cent shortage of workers—and they still failed to land an agreement with any of the states and territories. Worse than that—they actually cut $3 billion from the VET system and TAFE when they were in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I dare the Leader of the Opposition, who must be skulking around the building, watching on TV, walking past or having staff keep up with what's going on, to come in here and say the word 'TAFE'. The Leader of the Opposition, the purported alternative Prime Minister of the country, has no policies. Well, he does have policies. They're for giant cuts, but he won't tell you where or what, so he's got secret policies. He hasn't said the word 'TAFE'. He has not uttered the word 'TAFE' in this chamber, in this parliament, for 21 years. He could come in here and say 'TAFE' today. Nothing bad is going to happen. It's not scary. Millions of Australians go to TAFE. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition at least says 'TAFE'. She calls it 'wasteful spending'. But, there you go, the Liberals don't respect our public TAFEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a kind of stereotype. I want to sort of puncture the illusion here. The stereotype is that the Liberals are all for private and that Labor are all for TAFE. That is not my view. I'll put it on the record. I think TAFE is the backbone of our training system. I'm not ashamed to say it. It does the heavy lifting. It invests in the heavy capital courses that the private sector will not invest in. It's a market failure if you think that the private sector is going to do all of that. That's just a fact. It's TAFE that invests in the regions, in particular. It's absolutely critical for access and equity for outer metropolitan areas and for the regions. Private providers are not springing up overwhelmingly in those areas. TAFE is critical. It is the backbone of the training sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The private sector is also important, but it's part of the ecosystem that hangs around the backbone. The Liberals have a fundamentally different philosophy. They don't respect the TAFE system. They don't respect public TAFEs. They don't understand the value or importance of TAFEs in our local communities. They've shown time after time with flawed reforms that they will go for cheap and fast training over a well-supported and trusted VET sector with TAFE at the heart. The Minister for Industry and Science is sitting here and nodding furiously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TAFE is the core of the training sector. That shouldn't be a controversial proposition. Saying that is not anti every private provider. There are some fantastic private providers that innovate. They can be more nimble in responding at times to industry or business training needs, but they don't invest in the regions, the outer suburbs and those critical, high-value courses for the economy that might have high capital costs. That's what TAFE does, and it's important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say unashamedly that TAFEs are valued and trusted public institutions. They're trusted partners in our communities. They lead in innovating teaching and learning practices. They support students in succeeding and assist industries in developing skilled workforces. There's a TAFE in nearly every community across Australia, and every community across Australia deserves access to great vocational education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really encourage at least a few members of the opposition to use their brains, do the right thing and support the government's bill. I'm not holding my breath. They have this bizarre ideological opposition to universal services. They have this stated opposition to the concept of free TAFE. Well, we have a different view, and it's one part of the very clear choice that Australians will have at the election. The opposition have opposed every single cost-of-living measure that the government has put forward—no, no, no, no. Well, this government believes in training. We believe in skilling Australians. It's good for the economy. It's good for people's wallets and household budgets. It's a choice. I back free TAFE.</span>

TAFEs are state owned and operated. This is a very slippery slope that we get ourselves on in this federal parliament, where we see the failings of state governments and think that we'd better do something here in Canberra and end up owning the whole kit and caboodle, if you like. It's happened across a whole range of government services, which are provided by the states but are significantly funded by the federal parliament, and, of course, we lose control. While the federal government of the day wears the responsibility for raising taxes, in the end, the money is granted to the states, and we have—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAMSEY:</span>
                    </a>  They could probably both learn a bit. Where there's the responsibility of raising finance at one level of government, the money is just basically given to the states to spend on whatever operation they are running. I think that's poor governance in many ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of what I have to say relates to the South Australian experience because that is what I am most familiar with. I have many friends who have given up a significant portion of their lives to work and operate in the TAFE section as lecturers and training providers and have really believed in TAFE. Almost all of them have eventually left, very disillusioned with TAFE in South Australia and mystified as to why it has been driven into the ground and why it has consequently failed, largely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 in South Australia, there was a review that was ordered by the federal regulator and conducted by the Nous Group. It found that there were major problems with no less than 16 courses that TAFE in South Australia were offering. The review criticised the heavy funding cuts that had been delivered by, listen to this, the Labor government under Jay Weatherill. It said that TAFE had lost sight of the importance of quality. If confidence was already low in South Australia, that just smashed it. In many ways, it really spelt the demise of TAFE. Smaller facilities were closed completely; larger ones in many places were largely decommissioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a fellow called Jack Velthuizen in Whyalla, a significant Whyalla identity. I don't think he'll mind me quoting him in this area. He voted Labor all his life. I got on well with Jack. We understood each other. We knew how we each voted, but we both believed in Whyalla and in people. Jack was on the tools at the plant for much of his life, and he then ended up being a TAFE lecturer and was very proud of the metal workshops that were in TAFE at the time. In the end, they were idle, and he was beside himself with despair at what had happened. Jack went on to become president of the Whyalla Football League, which is a fair indication of his commitment to community and a position he held at the time of his demise, when he passed away in 2021. I miss him. He was a good fellow. But, anyway, he had become very disillusioned with the whole direction of TAFE. Of course, the problem was that these places had become deserted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd benefited at some level from TAFE training at some time. I think I did my first chem certs through TAFE, but I also did a tree-pruning course. I'm given to reflect that, in many places, they were delivering yoga instructor and dog handler courses and all that kind of thing. Honestly, if you want a business training enterprise, it needs to be focused on being a business training enterprise and getting on with the hard things in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, I think that TAFE lost its way. The consequence of that, of course, was that industry had no confidence. I just heard the member for Bruce speaking about how people trust TAFE. Well, I'm here to tell the parliament that they don't—certainly not in South Australia. I speak to people in industry about people coming to them with their qualifications and seeking work. When they saw that they'd done their training, their apprenticeship or whatever through TAFE, they basically didn't trust it. They'd say, 'That means they won't be able to operate this, that and everything else, and I'll have to train them from scratch again.' I have used this phrase: who ever failed a TAFE course? That tells you about the quality that is actually offered here in the end. I was speaking only recently to an acquaintance who did a 12-month TAFE course and didn't attend and received high marks in their exam. They passed the course, yet they'd barely attended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That tells you why the public and industry don't trust TAFE, and it tells us why, then, industry fled to the private sector for training. It's more flexible. It provides services when, where and how you need them. TAFE, by comparison, is a government organisation. The people that work there are public servants and it's heavily unionised. Consequently, it is just inflexible. Trying to get training courses delivered when it suits your workforce rather than when it suits the workforce at the training facility is one of the reasons they've been left behind. So industry have established their own training platforms. I live in Kimba, and just down the road from me, at Cleve—a distance of 100 kilometres or so—the Motor Trade Association have developed a regional training facility for country based mechanics. It's fantastic for the kids on the Eyre Peninsula and further afield that now don't have to go to the city and can access their training out in the country. Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association of Australia have their own training platforms and credentials that the industry trust and that they have designed for their use. This move for free TAFE undermines their efforts and investment, and it's dangerous. It is a move by this government to prop up failed state enterprises, and, as I said, we're on the sticky paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there is no budgeted provision for this expansion of free TAFE. How on earth can that happen? We have a whole raft of government policies now, including housing, the forgiveness—the write off—of HECS debts and extra investment in the NBN, all apparently not costing the budget a cent. These are billions and billions and billions of dollars that the federal government is committing itself to that magically don't appear in the budget papers. It makes a mockery of the Treasurer's claims that this government has delivered two surplus budgets. If that is the case, why is the net debt of the Australian government now higher than before the surplus budgets? It defies any logic at all, and it is an attempt by the government to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public. It will be exposed. In the coming months and the coming weeks, there will be increased scrutiny of the government's claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, in fact, an attempt to nationalise the training and skills industry. It undermines the investment of the housing industry, of the motor trades and of private providers like Career Employment Group, which are a very significant contributor in my electorate to actually piloting people through their training and through their apprenticeships, and they've got to compete with free. And the industry doesn't trust the credentials. I think it's a broken glass that can't be mended. Denita Wawn from Master Builders Australia has said that it unfairly distorts the market, and it does not bring more people to industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge is quality. Can TAFE rebuild that? I think it's pretty unlikely on the basis of the current dropout rate. The non-completion rate of free courses at TAFE is 87 per cent. That's telling us something. So far, the government has spent $1.5 billion on free TAFE, and there are 80,000 fewer apprenticeships and trainees today than when they came to office. That's a 20 per cent drop. For women, it's worse. The commencement stats have halved under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now the government is doubling down and trying to entice apprentices and trainees back into the system—back into a training facility that industry does not trust. I think this is bad government, quite frankly. I think it's undermining the investment and effort of others to build a system that they trust and that they rely on. Unbelievably, the government has not done any work on actually assessing the impact of the free TAFE policies that they've implemented so far, and they are pushing even further. This reeks of a captain's call, and, when captains make bad calls, the ship sinks.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is investing in young Aussies to give them the skills that they need, because we know that a strong vocational education and training sector is absolutely critical to ensuring that young Australians, certainly from the beautiful place that I represent in the Northern Territory—that young Territorians—get a secure, well paid job that fills the need in industry and throughout our society. What are we doing? The Albanese Labor government is investing in the skills the Territory needs and that Australia needs by making fee-free TAFE permanent for young Territorians, for young Australians around the country and for those that just want to retrain, try something different or start another career. Not only is this helping to relieve cost-of-living pressures for those seeking to skill up or re-skill but it's also absolutely vital to building the Territory's future and to building our nation's future. The Albanese government is committed to investing in the skills that Australia needs to drive the economic growth that we need. Labor will leave no-one behind and hold no-one back as our economy transitions into the future. Our fee-free TAFE offerings span those high-priority areas, including health, construction, early childhood education, hospitality and tourism, and renewable energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With unemployment so low, having young Aussies skilled up in these areas is absolutely critical. We need more people on the tools and fewer people sitting around at home with nothing to do. We've still got four per cent unemployment. We'd like to see everyone have an opportunity at getting a good job. It's a critical measure for reducing economic barriers and for addressing intergenerational disadvantage around the country but particularly, when I think about intergenerational disadvantage, in the Territory. Over 800 students from priority cohorts, such as those on low incomes, First Nations students and women who want to have a go non-traditional industries, have already enrolled in fee-free TAFE because it helps by taking away that financial barrier. Ongoing free TAFE will offer greater certainty to students, to employers and to industry, as well as to the state and territory governments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Free TAFE Bill 2024 will establish ongoing cost-of-living relief by removing those financial barriers to education and training that I mentioned, particularly for groups that typically experience economic disadvantage. The bill also ensures that fee-free TAFE continues to deliver a coordinated response to those workforce shortages that we all know. We see them in some industries that are certainly local but also national priorities, and we'll help build the pipeline of skilled workers that Australia needs now and into the future. Labor's providing cost-of-living support for more Australians to access high-quality, affordable training through the measures that we've put in place, delivering the skills and training needed to grow the economy, building the extra homes that we need, creating a future made in Australia, ensuring that all Australians can get quality care as they age—and, when they need care, through a good health system—and building the capabilities, which are increasingly technical in nature, that our Australian Defence Force needs.</span>

I know that we need young Australians with the skills required to deliver AUKUS. It's not just going to happen automatically. We need a pipeline of skilled young Australians. Our fee-free TAFE will deliver these skills that we desperately need to build this massive workforce. </span>

Up in my electorate, in the Territory, we are training and developing a workforce that is equipped with practical skills essential for not only a growing defence sector but also the net zero transformation that our nation has embarked upon.</span>

We plan to develop a renewable energy centre of excellence at CDU that brings together CDU, industry and unions, such as the Electrical Trades Union, in a powerful collaboration—pardon the pun there, Deputy Speaker—to drive skilled jobs across the Territory. One thing the Territory has got is a lot of space and a lot of sunshine, so we are going to convert that Territory sunshine into electrons for the renewable energy that we'll need to power an increasing industrial footprint on the ground in the Northern Territory. Working with industry and working with Charles Darwin University, we will make that a reality. This is absolutely vital to transform the Territory into a clean energy powerhouse and to provide projects like SunCable with the skilled Territorians that they need to deliver renewable energy for Australia and the world, such as our partners in Indo-Pacific nations like Singapore. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is you can't have a strong VET sector without strong public TAFE at its heart, and the Labor government will never consider that free TAFE is, to quote the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 'wasteful spending'. Someone who calls fee-free TAFE 'wasteful spending' is obviously from a background of significant means and doesn't understand the transformational power of education and trade training for young Australians—in particular, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Those opposite obviously haven't picked up that our government is tackling the cost of living robustly every day. By the way, every time we've put in a measure to help Australians with the cost of living, those opposite have voted against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people doing an apprenticeship, doing some trade training, can often find it difficult to make ends meet. I'll put a quick add-in for parents or grandparents who are listening. If your children or grandchildren are interested in doing a trade, know that we are backing them. The federal Labor Albanese government is backing your sons and daughters, in that we'll be giving some additional financial assistance to apprentices as they go through their training, after six months, 12 months, 18 months et cetera, to help with those cost-of-living challenges. We know that we have a responsibility to help people here and now, and, by making free TAFE permanent through this bill, we are reducing the barriers. By giving additional financial assistance to those doing an apprenticeship, we're making it easier for apprentices to make ends meet and to make that investment in their education and training so that they can manage the cost of living whilst they study and get those vital skills that our economy needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do owe a duty to the next generation of Australians—to our kids and, later, the grandkids coming through—to build an economy in this nation that liberates their talents and rewards their efforts. That starts with education for all, with the three days of early education, and then universal primary and secondary school education. Then there is university, with HECS debts cut by 20 per cent—as people get into the workforce, helping them again with the cost of living. Through the whole cycle of education in this nation, it's only federal Labor that has a plan and that is legislating to assist Australians through their journey of learning the new skills that we need in our economy. It's the economy that benefits, as well as the individual, our families and our communities. It's education for all. Australians, no matter what their background or financial situation, should have equal access to education. That's our mantra and what we strongly believe in. No-one is held back; no-one's left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, I've seen education delivering a future for young Territorians, whether it's through catching up with Clontarf or the STARS program up in the NT, and seeing what some added assistance and mentoring does for those young Territorians. Staying in school longer, getting a trade and going into higher education or into the workforce is absolutely vital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor believes in equal opportunity. By making TAFE free we are removing those financial barriers that I've mentioned. We will ensure that everyone has a chance to pursue a career that they love and to achieve their potential. As we've heard from previous speakers, this is not something that we have newly embarked upon. Supporting vocational education and training and TAFE is in federal Labor's DNA. We're reversing the damage of a decade under those opposite and we're rebuilding our TAFEs for communities across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor made the landmark $30 billion five-year National Skills Agreement with the states and territories, lifting investment in skills across Australia, alongside our government's growing investment in fee-free TAFE. We are going after the dodgy providers so that quality providers can do their work properly. The Albanese government has tightened up regulations, set up a tip-off line and increased funding to the independent regulator. This is directly leading to the exposure and deregistration of fraudulent providers. It only takes a few bad apples to bring a sector into disrepute, but it takes a genuine national partnership to support our great TAFEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have those opposite ever done to support TAFEs? Australians know that those opposite, given half a chance, will cut TAFE again. We've heard it from their very mouths just recently. The Liberals—those opposite—do not respect our public TAFEs. They don't understand or value the importance of strong TAFEs in our local communities. Our government is investing in young Australians to give them the skills that they need. A strong vocational education and training sector is absolutely critical to ensuring that Territorians and Australians around the country get a secure, well-paid job. This is critical to building the Territory's future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a clear choice at this election. Peter Dutton and the Liberals will cut free TAFE and Australians will end up paying more for TAFE, but, under our government, the Albanese government, free TAFE is here to stay.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  On election night I spoke about the historic mission of Labor governments: opening the doors of opportunity and then widening them. There's nowhere where that's more important than in vocational education and training. That is what this legislation does. It enshrines free TAFE as a permanent feature of our vocational education and training system. I'm very proud that no government has done more to rescue TAFE than we have, let's be frank. We have been working with state and territory governments across the board to provide the opportunity for young Australians to get the skills that they need but also to benefit workers retraining for new jobs and new industries with new skills. But the other things that free TAFE does aren't just benefiting an individual. We've created Jobs and Skills Australia to identify, with private sector involvement, what the skill sets that will be needed are, not just in a year but in five, 10 or 15 years time. Free TAFE is targeted at areas of skills shortage, both blue-collar and white-collar, such as electrical, construction and new industries such as information technology and the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as the care sector—people working in early childhood education and working in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We benefit employers and we benefit the whole economy. This is one of the key mechanisms that we have to boost productivity in this country. What this legislation does is take the success that free TAFE has been and say: 'We want to enshrine it. We want it to be permanent.' We, of course, have now had something in the order of 600,000 Australians who have benefited from free TAFE, and I've met many of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, I was at Swinburne TAFE with Minister Giles, with Matt Gregg, the local candidate for Deakin, and with Gabriel Ng, the candidate that we have for the electorate of Menzies. Most importantly, I met one young Australian who had been doing his law degree—and he's still doing it—but decided halfway through his law degree that he'd rather build stuff. He's going into carpentry and getting that satisfaction. We were there in a structure that was being built, and he was proudly speaking about joinery and the skills that he had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to give another shout-out as well—not just to the students. One of the things I have found from going into TAFEs from the time when I was the Labor shadow minister for employment, services and training—many years ago now—is that, for many older workers, they are so proud to go into the local TAFE and to impart their knowledge and skills as electricians, as plumbers and gasfitters or as carpenters onto a new generation of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we, as a government, are backing them in. We know that education is the most powerful weapon that we have against disadvantage and it is the best investment we can make in building Australia's future, because every challenge that we have to meet, every opportunity which is there to be seized, depends on investing in the skills and capacity of the Australian people, whether it's the tradies to build and plan the homes we need, the electricians and mechanics to deliver the clean energy to take us to net zero, the healthcare workers to look after our families, the aged-care workers and disability carers bringing security and dignity into the lives of our loved ones or the technology workers to help Australia succeed in a new era of digital transformation. In every field of national endeavour, so many of the jobs our nation needs to grow our economy, strengthen our society and compete and succeed in the world start at TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why one of our first priorities on coming to government was to put public TAFE back at the centre of vocational education and training, back where it belongs. There are many private vocational education and training providers who do a fantastic job, a great job, who specialise in a particular area and impart skills to Australians. But we know from the mess that was the migration system that we inherited that many of them simply aren't up to scratch. One of those things that we know about public TAFE is that, without exception, there's no-one by definition who goes to a public TAFE who says, 'Oh, I was ripped off,' 'It was just about profiteering' or 'I didn't get proper training.' We know that public TAFE is so important. Of course, the private sector has an important role to play as well, but if you don't have a public TAFE system that is effective then the system simply won't be able to deliver what is needed for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do note that the shadow minister, when speaking against this legislation, posed the question: what does it actually look like in the real world? Well, I'll tell you what it looks like in the real world. It looks like 35,000 Australians enrolling in construction courses. It looks like the carpentry students I have met everywhere, including in Adelaide. There are 35,000 studying early education. Katrina, from Swinburne TAFE, also in Melbourne, enrolled in a free certificate III course as a pathway to primary teaching because, in her words, 'Free TAFE came out and I thought: "Why not do it? I've got nothing to lose."' There are 50,000 people training in digital technology, and 130,000 I have met in TAFEs from Tasmania to South Australia to New South Wales to Queensland to WA who are engaged in aged care and disability care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what free TAFE looks like in the real world: aspiration in action, people aspiring to a better life for themselves but also aspiring to that sense of achievement when you can look at a new house that you have been a part of building, when you can look after an older Australian and know that you have given them dignity and respect in their later years, when you are a teacher who's managed to take a young Australian and help to shape their future and to educate them. That's what it looks like: hundreds of thousands of people training for a new career, whether they're young people or older workers training for a new opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of these free TAFE places, it's important to note that one out of every three has been taken up in regional communities, and that is so important as well. To quote Chad, whom I met as he was training to find a new job in the mining industry at Thornlie TAFE in Perth, where I visited along with the Premier, Roger Cook: 'I thought it was a great way to get my foot in the door. I'd say you should definitely have a crack.' Indeed, all over Australia, that is what our people are doing: backing themselves, getting the skills they need for a job that they want, not being held back by costs, not being left behind because they are unable to find a place. They are people being lifted up by public TAFE, and our economy and businesses are benefiting from a more skilled and a more productive workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth emphasising the connection between what TAFE delivers and our economic growth and our future, because a decade of cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships didn't just deprive people of the chance to train and retrain; it also inflicted on Australia the most severe skills shortage in 50 years. That's what we inherited. And skills shortages have an impact on the supply chain and then feed inflation. Indeed, they put petrol on inflation. That weakens our economic resilience, puts cost pressures on business and slows down key projects. And that's why it amazes me that the Liberal Party and the National Party are still saying that free TAFE is wasteful spending and a sugar hit. It's not a sugar hit and it's not wasteful. I'll tell you what's a waste. A waste is losing the potential of a young Australian to be trained for the jobs that they need. A waste is someone who needs to retrain for a new opportunity in life being denied that opportunity. There is waste of time and opportunity when housing and energy projects can't get underway because of skills shortages. There is waste when businesses have to look overseas, instead of Australians being trained and ready here at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at our migration system, I want our first priority—and I make no apology for this—to be the training of Australians. That should be our starting point. But so many businesses are so desperate for skilled workers that they have to look overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation, we understand that TAFE needs to be viewed as a component of the tertiary education system that is just as important as the university sector. Whether it's TAFE or university, we value both and we invest in both, and we want both to be affordable and accessible to all Australians, which is why we are also, of course, importantly, abolishing so much student debt. Three billion dollars of student debt has already been abolished, and we'll abolish 20 per cent of student debt if we are elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In announcing that the coalition would vote against this bill, the shadow minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And remember this, and it's a key principle and tenet of the Liberal Party: if you don't pay for something, you don't value it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a very clear, unequivocal statement from not just the shadow minister but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there explaining in just one sentence why the opposition are opposed to free TAFE and why, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, they sought to impose a tax every time someone visited a GP or every time someone went to a public hospital emergency department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That they don't value Australians is the real issue. Australians do value TAFE. They do value Medicare. They do value things that help to make their life better, and that is what this legislation does. I say this: as long as there is a Labor government, free TAFE is here to stay. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

Why is he not making private VET training free? If you are that concerned about VET training, make that free as well, Prime Minister.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that I, as one of 151 members in this House, am probably more qualified to talk about TAFE than anyone else here. That's because I've completed four courses through TAFE, from certificate I, certificate II and certificate III to diploma level. I've completed those all through TAFE.

                    </a>  I'll get back to my experience. I did hospitality training back when silver service—for those people that might have gone to restaurants back in the late eighties and early nineties—was a big thing. I trained at the Bracken Ridge TAFE, which is still operating today within my electorate of Petrie. That's where I did my first training, before I went on to a career in sales and so forth. I then did a Diploma of Business through TAFE because I always wanted to run my own business, like my father. I did that Diploma of Business up at the Caboolture TAFE, which no longer exists. It's outside my electorate; it's in Longman. I'm not sure what is there now. It was part of the North Point training, and I also finished it down in Bracken Ridge. I want to thank the lecturers that gave me that training. It was good. After a successful career in wholesale sales, I went on to run my own business in the pest control industry, and then I went to TAFE to do a certificate III as well, so I've had quite a bit of training within the TAFE system. I want to give a shout-out to the Redcliffe TAFE and the Bracken Ridge TAFE, within the electorate of Petrie, for the work those trainers do there. I also want to give a shout-out to the Australian Trade College North Brisbane, which has remarkable trade training at Scarborough, within my electorate. It's one of the few trade training colleges where you can go to school—in grades 10, 11 and 12—and actually do an apprenticeship while you're training, and they're getting some fantastic outcomes. The former Prime Minister visited that trade training centre before the last election and gave it some recognition, which it rightly deserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been on the 'Save TAFE' and free-TAFE bandwagon for the best part of 20 years. As I said the other day, when I'm dead and buried in 100 years, they'll still be talking about saving TAFE, free TAFE, saving Medicare—these are the parrot lines that they roll out every election. Let me give you an example. The former Labor member Yvette D'Ath, who I defeated in 2013, slid into the state parliament at a by-election and, in 2015, went into that state election as the member for Redcliffe and said: 'We've got to save TAFE. We're saving TAFE.' That's what she went into that election on. Two years later, in 2017, she said: 'Good news: the Palaszczuk government has saved TAFE. We've saved it. It's been completely saved in Redcliffe.' But then, at the 2019 federal election, Corinne Mulholland, the candidate that ran against me—who's now sliding into the Senate ticket, I believe—came out and said, 'We've got to save TAFE.' Can you believe the rhetoric of the Labor party?</span>

                    </a>  The member behind me gets it. So we've got a state MP in Redcliffe, entirely within the federal seat of Petrie, who was a former federal member for Petrie, saying, 'We've got to save TAFE,' in 2015 and, in 2017, 'We've completely saved it. It's brilliant. Thank you to the Palaszczuk government.' And then a Labor candidate in 2019 that had a seven per cent swing against her at that election said, 'We must save TAFE, and only Bill Shorten and that will be able to do it.' This is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were that serious about saving TAFE and making it free, what have they done in the last three years? We've seen a massive skills shortage. The reality is that more trade training and funding for apprenticeships was done under the last government than ever before. We had an entire scheme under the former coalition government called Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements, where we actually paid half the wages of every builder, plumber and carpenter in the country. That's the reality. At the moment, it's clear that we are in a cost-of-living crisis. It's clear that we don't have enough tradies, due to the 600,000 migrants that this government is bringing in each year. This picking and choosing is the big problem that we have with this government. Because TAFE is somehow in the public sector and has unionised jobs, their donors say, 'Well, you must support the public sector; you must support free TAFE.' The deputy leader of the Liberal Party is right in the sense that having something free doesn't mean you value it more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that people line up to go to university. If you look at the UQ or QUT campuses in Brisbane or even the USC campuses in the Leader of the Opposition's seat, you do pay to go to university. The government pays part of it, 80 per cent or so, roughly—depending on the course, it might be 40 to 60 per cent—and then the rest is HECS. There's no reason why TAFE, which is generally a cheaper course because it can go anywhere from six or 12 months to a maximum two years, couldn't have a small co-contribution like HECS does. If they were serious about giving everything for free, they would make the private sector free for VET as well. Those are the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality too is that, as Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services in the previous government, I know the previous governments were spending about 80 per cent of VET training on TAFE but only getting 20 per cent of the outcomes, and the private sector was getting 20 per cent of federal funding and delivering 80 per cent of the outcomes. Under the Albanese Labor government, do you know how many people are completing the free TAFE courses? The deputy leader is right when she says that people say that if it's free they don't value it. There's a 13 per cent completion rate for free TAFE. The ministers opposite get up and say, 'We need a bit longer, another 12 months, to see if it improves.' Well, let's say we triple it to 39 per cent. Do you still think that's acceptable with the amount of money? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this plan from Labor is a shambles, like most of what they have delivered over the last term of government. The coalition believe the VET sector is very important. I'm a product of it. It's very important. We encourage people to get into carpentry, building, plumbing, electrical and other trades, whether it's hairdressing—whatever it might be. We think that is very important. We will continue to make sure that VET is funded well, but we're not going to give all of the money to free TAFE. We'll also make sure that the private VET sector receives funding as well, and that's very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a problem with anything to do with the private sector, because it's not just TAFE and those private VET providers. If you look at the Leader of the House, when he was in charge of workplace relations one of the things he did was destroy the NESM, the new employment service model, for people wanting to help train people on the dole—JobSeeker, as it's called—and that industry is completely struggling. He took away all the mutual obligations for people on JobSeeker to actually get some training and to enrol in different courses. He took away all of that. The government and many opposite have an ideologically opposed position to the private sector. That is what we're seeing here with the bill, and that is why we are opposed to the it; 80 per cent of the jobs are in the private sector. Whilst a lot of trainers are very good, I have heard from builders and carpenters that some of the students that have just come out of TAFE haven't actually had good training. That's not at every TAFE but at some of them. And the private sector training, which this government will pretty well give very, very little to, is often better training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most of the government's policies, this only sounds good, but the devil is in the detail. It's $1½ billion of taxpayer money—it's your money, people in my electorate—for a 13 per cent completion rate through TAFE; a significant decrease in the number of apprenticeships; and no increase in total VET enrolments. That is important. The Prime Minister talks about a skills shortage, so how's that no increase going to help the country? They're doing free TAFE, absolutely ripping the guts out of the private VET sector, and there's no increase in total VET enrolments. This is an election ploy from a desperate government that has Australians in a cost-of-living crisis, with rents through the roof, mortgages through the roof and electricity prices up by 50 per cent—doubled for most businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve choice, and free TAFE denies everyday Australians choice. When a student chooses a university degree, they also get to choose the university that suits them. Maybe they make a choice because of the lecturers or the reputation and location of the uni, but the important thing is that they have a choice. Free TAFE has robbed tens of thousands of Australians of that choice. The Albanese government has created a significant social disadvantage and entrenched marginalisation with free TAFE. Not everyone has easy access to a TAFE college, and many regional towns don't have a TAFE college at all. Free TAFE makes the cost of living and housing affordability worse. Free TAFE means fewer apprentices, fewer houses and more expensive trade services due to a lower supply of qualified tradespeople. The two largest costs when building are the wages to the workers and the materials. When we don't train enough apprentices because this government ideologically opposes VET training in the private sector, the cost of available workers goes up, putting upward pressure on prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has presided over the collapse of the skills and training college, not the former coalition government. As I said before, we had half the wages paid for every apprenticeship in the country. It's their government that has a 13 per cent completion rate. This destruction of the skills pipeline will only get worse year on year on year on year without diversifying and resourcing the skills supply system across the board. When we don't train enough apprentices in any given year, we have to train double the following year to make up the shortfall and to build the numbers required in the following year. The problem with free TAFE is that, unlike private RTOs, who are paid only on completion—private sector VET RTOs are paid only on completion—TAFE are paid regardless of whether they produce an outcome or not. That's how they want to spend your money. So this money we need this year to catch up is already spent. This delivers very poor value for Australia. This is a bad policy from a bad government, and the coalition won't be supporting it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I am incredibly proud to rise today in support of free TAFE and the Free TAFE Bill which is before the parliament at the moment. I was in a taxi recently, and I did what I often do as a litmus test. I asked the taxidriver what he knows about the Labor government, the Albanese Labor government. I asked: what good thing does he know has come from this government? Before hesitating, without even thinking, he said to me, 'Free TAFE.' It was in his consciousness, and that taxidriver knew that this was a good thing, that people in his taxi talked about it and it is something that this government is delivering. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about opportunity. It's about equality. It's about ambition. It's about building a stronger Australia, one where education is accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford it. We know that education is the foundation of a strong economy. Over the next decade, nine in 10 new jobs will require post-secondary education and half of them will require vocational education and training. That means we need a strong, well-funded TAFE system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Albanese Labor government strongly believe in uplifting Australia's workforce through TAFE. We believe in public education and giving people the skills they need to succeed, to leave intergenerational poverty and to have opportunity. It sounds corny, I know, but so many people have said to me it means they can reach their dreams. We believe in backing our world-class TAFEs to train the workforce of the future. That side, as we heard from the previous speaker, only believes in the private sector. But this bill does so much more than offer someone a profit. It cements the Albanese Labor government's commitment to free TAFE, making it a permanent feature in Australia's education system. It locks in funding and ensures that states and territories can continue to deliver the skills training we so desperately need. The bill underpins our government's commitment to funding at least 100,000 free TAFE places a year from 2027. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to commend the previous Minister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and of course the current minister, Andrew Giles, for leading this incredibly important initiative. These initiatives are in contrast to what the coalition oversaw in their term of government—a VET sector that was thrown into neglect and fracture, one that led Australia into its biggest skills shortage in 50 years and the second-biggest skills shortage in the OECD. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of not investing in TAFE is too high. If we don't, businesses will struggle to find skilled workers. Essential industries like health care, construction, early childhood education and care, and clean energy will face crippling staff shortages, and too many Australians will be locked out of the training they need to build a better life for themselves and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve opportunities, and they deserve to dream. I know what education has meant for me. Deputy Speaker Goodenough, given how spritely I look, it might surprise you to know I've had other careers before politics.</span>

                    </a>  I know; it's hard to believe! But from the mid-eighties until the early 2000s, for almost two decades, I worked as a nurse. Nursing isn't just a job. It's a career that enables you to make a real difference—a difference that often means saving people's lives. Nurses have been and always will be the backbone of our healthcare system. I had the great opportunity of becoming a nurse through free education, because when I was in my early 20s you could train to become a nurse through the vocational educational system. I was a sole parent and went back to train after my twins were only seven weeks old. There is no way that I could have done that as a sole parent if I wasn't in the vocational education system, getting paid to work and learn on the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now of course nursing is taught in universities, and I'm proud to say that this government has recognised the difficulty that places on people financially and is funding paid clinical placements. But back in my day, there's no way I could have afforded to complete my training if it wasn't for the vocational education sector. Being a nurse as a woman meant I got to have my own career, my own money, my own agency and my own choices. I was able to raise four children. It set me up to have a whole career, rather than just a job. It enabled me to become a nurse educator with Austin Health. I was federal secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and now—I pinch myself every day—I'm the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health. The lessons I learned while training to be a nurse back in those early days informs my work to this very day. Nursing is a career I'd recommend to anyone—as long as you're not squeamish!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, Australia needs more nurses. In fact, we're facing unprecedented demand for nurses and aged-care workers. Our aging population is growing, and with it the need for a compassionate, skilled workforce who can provide high-quality care to those who have spent their lives building this country as well. By 2050 we will need over 200,000 additional aged-care workers just to keep up with demand. Yet for too many people the financial barriers to training in these fields have kept them from pursuing this rewarding work. That's why free TAFE is so important. It's not just an investment in individuals; it's an investment in the care of our most vulnerable people. Since its introduction more than 130,000 students have enrolled in courses to train as enrolled nurses, aged-care workers and early childhood educators. That's 130,000 more Australians who are stepping up to care for our most vulnerable people. I hope to see many more training for the care economy into the future, including the wonderful at Melbourne Polytechnic Preston in my own growing electorate of Cooper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. This is also a woman's issue. The vast majority of workers in health care, aged care and early childhood education are women. When we invest in free TAFE, we are directly supporting women's economic security, helping them gain qualifications, secure well-paid jobs and build financial independence. This bill is about ensuring that women, who make up a majority of our growing care workforce, are given opportunities and agency and are able to pursue their passions. It's not about living just for bread but also about living for the roses. This is exactly what free TAFE does. It allows working mums to upskill and re-enter the workforce without taking on student debt. It ensures young women looking for a career in health care or education aren't held back simply because they can't afford tuition fees. If we're serious about closing the gender pay gap, about giving women economic independence and about valuing the work that has been so often taken for granted, then we have to invest in these professions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the opportunities that free TAFE can present for women, I think of a young woman in my electorate called Charlotte. Charlotte, unfortunately like too many Australians, spent much of her youth escaping with her mother and sisters from violence perpetrated by their father. She lived with trauma, poverty and fear. These experiences, tied with the global pandemic in her last few years of school, meant Charlotte really struggled to complete school. She didn't get the grades she wanted and, frankly, Charlotte really struggled to feel positive or motivated about her future. For years after school she struggled to retain secure work in hospitality or live on wages from casual and insecure work. Her mum forwent a lot to keep Charlotte afloat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlotte's mental health and lack of formal education may have been a setback but they certainly couldn't define her. Growing up in a turbulent home showed Charlotte that life could be tough, but, while overcoming it all, Charlotte was also shown resilience, strength and care from her mum and within herself. Charlotte fought through trauma and mental health problems, learning the difference that can be made by having people around you who care. Charlotte now wants to replicate the care that was shown to her by her mum through all those years by pursuing a career in community services. In 2025, through free TAFE, Charlotte will do just that. Free TAFE for Charlotte is a second chance. It's a door opener. It's an opportunity maker. It's not insecure hours of work and pay; it's a fulfilling career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many others, like Charlotte, changing the trajectory of their lives through free TAFE. I am so proud of her, and I know her mum and her sisters are too. There are so many other stories about resilience and education. Like Charlotte, these people most definitely—I guarantee it—value their fee-free TAFE education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Albanese Labor government introduced fee-free TAFE, we've seen 508,000 enrolments in the first 18 months, 130,000 students training in the care sector, 35,000 people training in early childhood education, and almost 35,000 students training in construction. Priority cohorts have particularly benefited from the program. I'm proud that over 170,000 Australians, and over 124,000 jobseekers, have already enrolled in free TAFE. More than 60 per cent of places are being taken up by women, and one in three places are in regional Australia. These aren't just numbers; these are real people, like Charlotte, getting real qualifications and real trajectories, with real lives being changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the success that free TAFE has had because of the partnerships with our states and territories. They've coordinated the skills and training that their future workforces need for their industries and they've ensured TAFE students are working towards a real job, not an empty qualification. Planning for future industries like clean energy, housing construction and the care economy relies on a secure and growing workforce. The states and territories know this only too well. The Free TAFE Bill is important because it commits the Commonwealth to ongoing support for free TAFE while allowing states to tailor their programs to local needs. This is how good government works—not through insecurity, not through cuts and not through neglect, but through collaboration and long-term investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when the Liberals were last in government they cut $3 billion from the VET system and TAFE. We know that if the coalition had their way we would see these cuts replicated. Education inequality would widen, aspirations would be crushed, women entering the workforce would be inhibited and older workers needing to retrain would be locked out. This would mean housing, energy projects, and childcare and aged-care centres couldn't get off the ground because of skills shortages, and it would mean businesses would be forced to look overseas for workers instead of employing Australians right here at home. We know that the Leader of the Opposition hasn't even said the word 'TAFE' in this place since 2004 and we've heard time and again that the opposition consider this to be wasteful spending. We know all about how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, speaking on this very bill, said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it's a key principle and tenet of the Liberal Party: if you don't pay for something, you don't value it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, education is not wasteful. Investing in future industries is not wasteful, investing in future workforces is not wasteful and investing in people is not wasteful. Giving people, especially women, the tools they need to build a better life is not wasteful. If the Liberals had their way, they would cut funding to TAFE, reduce access to education and leave Australian businesses scrambling to find workers. Australians deserve uplifting. We cannot afford to let this happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about opportunity, fairness and a stronger future for all Australians. It's about investing in our growing industries, like the care economy, clean energy and housing construction. It's about investing in individuals to afford them more opportunities to reach their dreams. It's about valuing female dominated industries and workers. It's about ensuring that, whether you are a young person looking for a new start, a mum trying to look after her kids and re-enter the workforce or a worker retraining for a new career, you have the opportunity to get the skills you need without being held back by the cost. That's why I proudly commend this bill to the House, and I urge those on the crossbench to do so too.</span>

                    <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  It's a great pleasure not only to speak in this debate but to follow someone I regard highly, Assistant Minister Kearney, who rightly spoke of skilling up people in roles that the community values, not the least of them being nurses and midwives—people who at our time of need provide us with critical support. And you want to make sure that at that point in time you've got people who are skilled up to do so. The government certainly believe in the value of that, and I want to thank Assistant Minister Kearney for her service in advocating for more skills in this area and more support for our nurses in this country. I think it is important that we do so. And it's not just me; I think average Australians around the country would too. We want to see more of that happen. We want to see more people trained up. We recognise the value of TAFE and vocational education in helping not just our economy and our country but the people who benefit from that training and the opportunities it opens up for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, I'm speaking in favour of the Free TAFE Bill 2024, because fee-free TAFE places will become a permanent feature in our vocational education and training system. It's a program that has made a huge difference to many people in Western Sydney, and we want to see that change locked in for good. As the son of a welder, I certainly know the value of learning a trade. My dad's skills kept a roof over our heads, food on the table and bills paid. His trade gave our family opportunity and gave him the chance to contribute to building the future of his adopted country, a country that welcomed him and allowed him to get to work. He got to work on some pretty big projects in his time. He speaks fondly of his ability to participate in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme development. A lot of things have changed in Western Sydney since those days, but not the value of learning a trade. Today, having a trade continues to mean well-paid work for mums and dads and sons and daughters across our suburbs, bringing not just economic opportunity for them but the skills base needed to build a really strong future for the rest of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an example of how important that is in my community. Last year, I was invited to break ground on what will be the largest data centre campus in the Southern Hemisphere. A great Australian success story, CDC, is behind the project. It's being built in Marsden Park in the electorate that I'm very proud to represent. The numbers are truly staggering. It will be the size of 27 soccer fields, with state-of-the-art facilities hosting cloud, classical and high-end AI computing. It'll be the envy of the world, the beating heart of the Sydney Business Park, and it will create spin-off industries and support other businesses across the country. It's a project that will need about 10,000 skilled workers. A lot of them aren't just in IT. To build the thing, you need construction skills. To keep something this big running, you need sparkies; heating, cooling and ventilation trades; and security workers and admin workers. That's not counting the incredible opportunities of having this facility in our backyard. It will create thousands more skilled work opportunities, well-paid work for thousands and thousands of families so they can get the best from the west and our unbeatable lifestyle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers in Western Sydney are excited about the opportunities. Businesses in our region are absolutely crying out for skilled workers. It's one of the big things industry raise with me. They want talented workers. This is across the board. It's not just in digital and tech, bearing in mind that we have an ambition as a nation; this government is committed to making sure we reach the target of 1.2 million Australians employed in tech related jobs by 2030. It's good for the country. It's good for businesses. It's good for those workers in particular. We see it in construction. We see it in manufacturing. We see that those areas need people. In construction, for example, it's estimated that we're about 90,000 workers short. We need people to build homes and build commercial premises across this great country of ours. Because of our fee-free TAFE program, there are 31,000 VET students just in the electorate of Chifley. There are more opportunities for families to get ahead and more skills for businesses who want to invest in the long-term future of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of claims have been made in the course of this debate. The good thing about our democracy is that you get different sides putting different views forward. From time to time, I think that's very much a good thing, but you hope that we're doing this on the basis of facts and evidence. One of the things that have been an issue for many years is skill shortages. I just want to reflect on the contribution made by the member for Flinders, who referenced her work in this House, under the Howard government, to be able to provide skills packages. If you listened to that contribution, you would think, 'That's a pretty impressive piece of work. There are probably elements of it that people would welcome.' Bear in mind that, by the point at which the Howard government announced that, there were these things that were referred to as capacity constraints in the economy. The two biggest ones, which had dragged on for years, were infrastructure bottlenecks because the federal coalition government didn't commit to infrastructure investment, and the other massive capacity constraint, which was reflected on by people from the RBA to economists to businesses, was skill shortages. Why? Because you had a federal coalition government under John Howard that was either at war with universities or wouldn't fund TAFE. He would not fund TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the contribution by the member for Flinders, who I sat and listened to, she talked about setting up a separate stratum for training in technical colleges, quite distinct from TAFE. They would fund a rival TAFE. They did this quite often. They also set up, in schools, technical trade centres that we then had to support and adopt when we took office in 2007. But, again, it was about creating rival systems to those in the states—a wasteful, ideologically driven approach that didn't address the long-running problems that had been created in the economy and that got worse. The coalition government scrambled to put a package together, and that's what you saw. Those things weren't reflected on by the member for Flinders. We then had the way-out-there contribution by the member for Petrie, who was in the chamber when we heard from the Prime Minister himself his positive reflections on the contribution of the private training sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're focusing on is TAFE, because, as most people think, if you're going to make an investment, where do you get the biggest bang for your buck? From our point of view, a publicly funded TAFE system that a lot of Australians are familiar with, supportive of and can get access to is probably the fastest way to do it. This is not an either/or situation. It is about maximising the value of taxpayer dollars by going in and supporting TAFE at the point at which it needs that support. At a time when we need more skills, what we're trying to do through fee-free TAFE places is attract people to take up a TAFE course. We want to see that backed. That is why we support it. Now what we have is a coalition opposing the idea that you would have fee-free TAFE places that would attract and train up the people we need to fill the skills shortage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the alternative to this? It's to use a private system, which even those opposite recognise has challenges. When the coalition was in government, remember, the then minister, Simon Birmingham, had to undertake a massive reform program because that system was full of providers that we recognised were engaged in practices that were luring students in and were not delivering the training that they should, because they were dodgy providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the case for all private providers, I emphasise, but even the coalition recognise that it needs to be reformed. This was done, again, when they refused to properly fund TAFE in their last time in office. They refused to back, at the appropriate point in time, skills agreements with the states and territories and they starved TAFE of vital dollars. They did it in the Howard government and then they did in the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments as well, and they took their sweet time to reform private training, which then created other problems for other students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we recognise that there are some good private providers around. There absolutely are. What we're trying to do, as I said, is provide bang for the buck in making sure that we have a public TAFE system central to our system, that we attract people in, train them up as quickly as we can and put them to work in an economy that needs those skills. This is not playing ideological games. It's about being practical, not ideological, as opposed to what the coalition does and as opposed to some of the way-out-there arguments that the member for Petrie put on the public record in his 'contribution' to this debate, just walking past all those problems that existed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that, while I do have a lot of time for the member for Wentworth, the member for Wentworth's big argument at the end of her contribution was: 'This is something that will happen down the track. Why are we doing this now?' I am left thinking, when we often get criticism in this country that governments don't think ahead enough, at a point where a government is thinking ahead, is giving certainty, is providing funding certainty, we should be putting this in place and we should be flagging a long-term mechanism to provide that support and ensure that people know that this will continue for a long time and that they can go into TAFE and do so. We will not go back to the old days. The member for Petrie said, 'Why don't we have TAFE students pay for their education?' That is what he advocated at the dispatch box. That is exactly what we are trying to avoid with this bill. It is to avoid people paying and to attract them in. That's the big difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said there is a contest of ideas. The contest of ideas here comes down to the coalition, which says that you will not value education if you don't pay for it. You need to send a price signal. You need to send a price signal, apparently, on health care as well. The Leader of the Opposition said the same thing many times as health minister. But then the same coalition that says we shouldn't be backing free TAFE, we shouldn't be backing free medicine and affordable healthcare, can in the next breath say, 'But we should fund lobster mornay, truffle oil and free lunches for employers.' Something does not gel when you make that argument. The country recognise the value of affordable health care and that they don't avoid getting health care because they can't afford it. The country also get that we should be training people up at speed so we get those skills into the economy and into businesses that are always saying they want skills. Instead, we have a coalition that wants to play ideological games and stand in the way of those reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's anything positive that I may say about the coalition, it's that they're consistent. They never support properly funding education. They never support making sure that people who may not have the means to fund themselves entirely throughout their education get some support to do so. We believe that, if you've got skills, your background and your parents' income should not be the determinant of whether or not you get educated. We want Australians from all corners of the country and all backgrounds to be able to step up and build a better country, and they should be skilled up and backed to do so. We should not have a situation where people feel that education can be supported only for those people that have the means and the wealth to do so. I reckon there are a lot of Australians who would agree with the sentiment that, if you've got the talent, we need to get you to the front and make sure we put your skills to work. That's what we are trying to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are trying to encourage people to go forward and pursue the skills they need and the talent they require for our economy and our country. That is why we support the Free TAFE Bill 2024. It's good for the country, it's good for the economy, and it's good for everyday Australians who want to get ahead and aspire to do better in their lives. If we can make that happen, then that is a great thing for this nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  The best thing you can do to improve social upward mobility and economic security for a person is to ensure that they receive a good education. In the 21st century, an evermore technological and technical age, the average minimum level of education and skill attainment required to enter and remain in the workforce is steadily increasing. In fact, we see that nine in 10 jobs will need post-school study over the next 10 years and half of those jobs will require vocational education and training. Our government recognises and understands this, so the Albanese Labor government is making free TAFE permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE has been an absolute game changer for thousands of people in my community and more than 70,000 people across Western Australia. In February last year, I had the opportunity to welcome the Prime Minister to the Thornlie TAFE campus, which is part of the South Metropolitan TAFE, in my community, where students were learning the skills they need in robotics and autonomous operations to support WA's mining sector, the powerhouse of the nation. That day, the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to chat about those students and find out what compelled them to go to TAFE. The feedback was overwhelming. The course was free. They had always wanted to study at TAFE. They saw the benefits of being able to get a TAFE qualification, but they wouldn't have been able to afford a career change or that qualification if they had had to pay the fees. Thanks to fee-free TAFE, they were able to gain the skills in the areas they had previously only dreamed of participating in, setting up themselves and their families for greater economic security and new jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In just the first 21 months of fee-free TAFE, there have been 568,000 enrolments. Fee-free TAFE has created so many opportunities for people in the electorate that I represent, the people of Burt, in the south-eastern suburbs of Perth. Indeed, 27 per cent of the members of my community hold a TAFE qualification. It is the main type of qualification for people in my community to be able to progress into the workforce. The importance of being as accessible to as many people as possible cannot be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Thornlie campus of TAFE, which is the largest TAFE campus in the south metro area, there's a focus on things like ICT but also on trades and jobs that support our mining sector, like engineering, autonomous control, remote operations and mechanics. At the Armadale campus, the courses reflect some of the leading industries and employers in our south-eastern suburbs: the care sector, early childhood education and community services. Recently, I was very pleased to attend the opening of the brand-new TAFE facility in the heart of Armadale, which expanded even more the offerings that TAFE provides in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Training people for these in-demand jobs and not charging fees will not only change their lives but also change the lives of the individuals who benefit from those industries. Making free TAFE permanent will give certainty to young Australians and older Australians looking for a career change and help us bridge the skills gap. Indeed, when I was attending the opening of the new Armadale TAFE campus, I spoke to some young women there. I spoke to some mums looking to re-enter the workforce as their children were about to enter compulsory schooling. The observation was made that they were prioritising other things with their families' finances. They couldn't access TAFE if they had to pay a fee. However, making TAFE free meant that it would fit within their family budget and enable them to retrain and go on to new careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, a lot of these training opportunities in my community go into the care economy, where we are seeing a shortage of people working in aged care and child care and people that we need in our Armadale-Kelmscott Memorial Hospital. Making sure we're bridging that skills gap by giving the opportunity for locals to train in those areas is incredibly important not just for them but for our entire community. When we came into government, Australia had its worst skills shortage in 50 years and the second worst across every advanced economy. It is vital that we secure free TAFE today and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has confirmed, though, that they will oppose this legislation to make free TAFE enduring. They believe, apparently, that it's 'wasteful spending', and they're opposed to the policy on the grounds that, if you don't pay for something, you don't value it. I can tell them that, from everyone I've spoken to who has studied at TAFE, who has gained a qualification from TAFE, they very much do value it and see the benefits but the fees have stood in the way of them being able to progress through TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, though, the opposition don't see the value in getting Australians trained up for the jobs of now and the jobs of the future. They don't see the value in giving Australians the credentials they need not only to get by but also to allow them and their families to thrive. It's in their record. The last time the Liberals were in government, they ripped $3 billion from TAFE and training over a decade of calculated, systemic neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2014 and 2019, they cut $220 million from trade support loans, $201 million from apprenticeship centres, $160 million from adult migrant English programs, $125 million from apprenticeship incentives and $75 million from industry skills funds. It's only the Albanese government that will protect and deliver free TAFE around the country. Somewhat more concerningly, the Liberals' opposition to free TAFE is as much driven by their hatred of TAFE merely because it is a state government run entity as it is by their lack of support for training of the workforce of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it seems that, when we look at the policy positions being put forward by the opposition right now, they are against free TAFE but they're pro free lunches for bosses. They're for the bosses, but they're against the workers, the workers that we need to deliver the essential services here in Australia. We're all about supporting free enterprise and we want to see industry flourish—indeed, that's where we see jobs being created—but it's a very interesting dichotomy that they are creating over there, those people in the opposition that say, 'If it's free, you won't value it.' They want to create free lunches for bosses—I wonder how much they'll value that?—but they don't support fee-free TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to be able to join with my colleagues across the parliament today to ensure that students in my community and, indeed, the businesses across the nation will now have certainty, a pipeline of career opportunities and skilled workers in areas where they need them most. This bill will support the delivery of at least 100,000 free TAFE places across Australia each year and into the future. That is what building Australia's future really looks like. The Albanese government's primary focus is, of course, to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australians. It's a work in progress, but this free TAFE initiative is just one of those that we've introduced to help with hip-pocket pain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government, inflation was high and rising, real wages were falling, living standards were declining and people were going backwards. We had one of the largest skills shortages that we had ever faced. Under the Albanese government, inflation is almost a third of what it was when we took office, and it's continuing to fall. Real wages are growing again, and living standards are rising. We've recorded the lowest unemployment rate for a government in 50 years and we've overseen the creation of 1.1 million jobs—the most jobs created on record in a single parliamentary term.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians are doing it tough, which is why we're doing everything that we can to help deal with the cost of living. That's why we made sure every taxpayer got a tax cut and every household got energy bill relief. It's why people have access to cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, a stronger Medicare and free TAFE. It's why we'll cut student debt by 20 per cent. It's also why we've announced a $10,000 incentive payment for Australians in construction apprenticeships. Labor's plan for a future made in Australia is very clear. We want Australian workers to make more things here. That includes building more homes to not only support those who need homes now but make sure that our economy is best placed to thrive in the future. That's also what is behind our production tax credit legislation, which is currently before the other place. And, of course, one of our biggest nation-building endeavours, central to our national defence—AUKUS—requires hundreds and thousands of skilled workers in existing and new career opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence joined the Minister for Skills and Training and the Western Australian Premier in Western Australia to launch the new centre of excellence for defence training at the naval base TAFE, as part of the South Metro TAFE. And we're seeing across our South Metro TAFEs new courses and the expansion of courses to support the work of AUKUS and shipbuilding in Western Australia, because, unlike those opposite, we on the Labor side in government, the Albanese government, have actually delivered on a continuous shipbuilding plan for Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the work of sustainment that will occur as part of the AUKUS plans and when we look at the continuous shipbuilding plan that we've launched for Western Australia, it will see the creation of intergenerational jobs. We see it in other countries in their submarine depots. We see it where they build submarines. We see it in their other shipbuilding endeavours, where you have generation after generation after generation working in those jobs. It's the sort of job security that we thought did not exist in the 21st century but, when it comes to naval defence, does provide that sort of job certainty and career opportunity for generations to come. So we need to make sure that we're providing the opportunities for Australians to be trained in those careers to take up those jobs that are so important for them as individuals, for their families, for our community and, indeed, for our national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this will mean, through sustainment, maintenance and continuous shipbuilding in Western Australia, is that that will become the second biggest industry in Western Australia. It will be the major employer. That is a huge leap. It's a huge leap for Western Australia, but it means something else for our national economy. You'll be familiar, Deputy Speaker, with the idea of complexity in the economy. When we talk about a future made in Australia—this is it. We will be building these ships in Australia, in Western Australia. We'll be maintaining these submarines in Western Australia. This is advanced manufacturing and technology. This requires the new skills that people will be able to obtain through TAFE. That's why TAFE is such a critical enabler to see the advancement of our national security, economic security, financial and economic security for individuals and families and in growing new businesses that will be supporting this endeavour as well. This all goes to underline why free TAFE is such an important economic measure here in Australia, to not just ensure that we're giving people that pipeline to access a higher education, to be able to secure their own and their family's economic security, but make sure we have the necessary skills that we need in our nation for the challenges, sustainability and prosperity of our country into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today will make free TAFE permanent. This will continue to relieve cost-of-living pressures by removing financial barriers to education and training for people, many of whom live in communities like mine. For these reasons—as somebody who has attended TAFE myself and had the benefit of being able to use that learning not only in a career before I'd finished university but all the way through, the learning that I was able to undertake at TAFE has provided me with great benefit—I very much commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  I cannot understand for the life of me why you would object to fee-free TAFE. It seems to me that the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that you don't value anything unless you pay for it makes absolutely no sense. What the Free TAFE Bill 2024 will provide is opportunity, and it will provide the workforce and the skills that this country needs. It will also mean that people who are from backgrounds that aren't flush with money will be able to access education at the TAFE level. That's what it actually means. I think it is mean-spirited and short-sighted to not support this bill. There is nothing to not support. I join with my colleagues here today in supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has been a running theme in my whole life. I was a school teacher, and I led the Aboriginal Education Consultative Group in New South Wales. I also was a board member of the Board of Vocational Education and Training in New South Wales and a board member of the accrediting authority in New South Wales for curriculum—the Board of Studies, as it was called back then. All of those positions give me a very thorough background in all aspects of education, from early childhood through to university. I well remember the work that I did on the Board of Vocational Education and Training around the VET sector, both private and public providers. I also understood that many people saw VET as a poor cousin to university. That is no longer the case in Australia. TAFE has come into its own. It provides courses that are varied, but, importantly, it also provides basic educational courses, and these are critical for people who are looking at second-chance education. My own son struggled with the HSC. He went to TAFE and did the HSC qualifier again and did brilliantly. So I have a great deal to commend, and my family owes a great deal to TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, it seems to me that this is one of the most exciting, far-reaching and equitable things that could possibly happen to the TAFE sector, and yet we have an opposition that says, 'You don't value anything if you don't pay for it.' This bill is about opportunity. This bill is about the future. This bill will provide opportunity and a future for thousands and thousands of people. The hundreds of thousands of people, like my son, who are looking for second-chance education are also seeing this as an opportunity and as an equitable measure as well. Children from families that are doing it tough—we talk about them a lot. We have in front of this parliament a bill that will provide to precisely those children of families that are doing it tough. And a cost-of-living measure, in many ways, is what this is. Yet, as I say, we have an opposition that cannot be generous enough, that cannot be forward-thinking enough, to see this bill in those terms. This will mean, particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, a spoke in the wheel of that terrible cycle of poverty. It will change lives, it will change families, and it will change communities. Older adults who have never got the chance earlier in their lives will now have that chance. They will be able to adopt those economic changes. Each of them will be able to get ahead with a good education, if that's what people choose. The Labor government, through this bill of fee-free TAFE, is providing that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government believes TAFE is an essential part of the education system, not an add-on. Since coming to government, we have made the landmark $30 billion National Skills Agreement. The agreement included $214 million of investment to close the gap in educational outcomes for Indigenous people. We're going after dodgy providers, and, like the Minister for Skills and Training said, there are many good providers, but there is nothing as broad, nothing as nationally significant and nothing as geographically spread as TAFE in Australia. There is nothing like it. That is why this will be the envy of the world. The investment in a country's future is what this is about—fee-free TAFE. In the first 20 months, there have been 568 enrolments. That's half a million enrolments. Those courses are providing a pathway to well-paid and secure employment for hundreds and thousands of people. How on earth could you object to that? How could you not see the value in that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many stories that we have heard about people who were able to access TAFE and therefore save enough money to go on to university, to go on to better lives. The National Indigenous Australians Agency has highlighted that this policy is contributing to closing that stubborn gap. Fee-free TAFE is an important initiative to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's participation in VET by helping to overcome financial barriers. There are stories like Christy's—I think we've heard her story—who accessed fee-free TAFE and was able to go on to do a nursing degree. It will provide long-term cost-of-living relief by removing financial barriers to education and training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often heard in this House how education is the great equaliser. That is the way in which, if the opposition had any generosity of heart, they would see this. Yesterday, a member opposite joked about Labor's commitment to TAFE. Labor wouldn't need to be rebuilding TAFE every time we came to government if there hadn't been neglect by the Liberals. Facilities were run down, you cut $3 billion nationally from the VET system, and teacher numbers were left to dwindle. We all remember those days. All of this happened during major skills shortages in construction and the care economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is not wasteful spending. I think it is an investment in this country's future. I think it is an investment in a system that has proven itself, and that's the TAFE system in New South Wales. I would say to those opposite: hundreds of thousands of TAFE students know the value of education. They know good education means a pathway to a good job, a well-paying job that gives them a future. Jobs and Skills Australia research has found TAFE and VET graduates boost their median income by almost $12,000 and are more likely to be employed after completing their qualification—by 15 per cent. Those figures are the real figures that need to be concentrated on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living is biting many family budgets. Financial barriers often stop people from entering further education. This is about addressing that issue. This is about benefiting students right now while they build skills for the future—students like the ones we have heard about during this debate. Students in early childhood education are saving over $4,000 in South Australia and the Northern Territory. This is not small change. Free TAFE is taking pressure off Australians. It is breaking down the financial barriers stopping them from furthering their education. And it is helping to fill the skills gaps in our workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, to me, epitomises what the Labor Party is about. It is about providing opportunity. It is about thinking about the future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank all the honourable members who have contributed to this debate about making free TAFE a permanent feature of our national VET system. Free TAFE is changing lives and delivering cost-of-living relief to hundreds of thousands of Australians, and that's why we're locking it into law, not cutting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since free TAFE started in 2023, there have been close to 600,000 enrolments. Over 191,000 young Australians, 140,000 jobseekers and 34,000 First Nations Australians have enrolled in free TAFE. More than six in 10 places have been taken up by women, one in three in regional and remote Australia. We've had 39,000 enrol in construction courses, 40,000 in early education, 54,000 in digital technology and 150,000 in aged care and disability care. Tens of thousands of jobseekers are getting a fresh start. Hundreds of thousands of young people are training for a new career, and older workers are training for a new opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these are not just numbers. Each one is a story of individuals and of families, a story about the joy of achievement and the satisfaction and reward of meaningful work. And it's a story about stronger, happier communities and a healthier, more diverse economy. Our investment sends a clear message to each and every person enrolled and anyone thinking about enrolling: 'We back you. We support your education. We support your aspiration. We won't cut it. We want you to get that qualification to help build the life you want.' Investment in free TAFE is not wasteful spending which needs to be cut, as we've heard members of the coalition say in this place. I can tell you that every free TAFE student I've met certainly values their education and the doors that it is opening—students like Caitlin, a Navy veteran and single mum here in Canberra. She told me she wanted to become a nurse but couldn't afford to study until the Albanese government made it free.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free TAFE offers an ongoing, coordinated approach with states and territories to addressing the nation's skills shortages, which we inherited after a decade of inaction from the previous government. The Free TAFE Bill 2024 commits the Commonwealth to continuing support for at least 100,000 free TAFE places a year from 2027, bringing costs down so that more Australians can access high-quality, affordable training. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank states and territories for their critical role in ensuring the success of the current free TAFE program. This is a true partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the discussion and debate that's occurred in the House and the broader community since my second reading speech. Many members have highlighted how free TAFE will build Australia's future and deliver ongoing benefits to their communities, to industry and to the economy. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, there have also been some disappointing contributions offered up by Liberal Party and National Party members, signalling that free TAFE is on their cuts agenda. The Liberals have made it clear they don't believe TAFE students are worth the investment. In fact, it appears to be Liberal policy that TAFE students don't deserve cost-of-living relief, but bosses going out for long lunch and karaoke need 20 grand a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said the quiet part out loud when she declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it's a key principle and tenet of the Liberal Party: if you don't pay for something, you don't value it. So, if you're told that your TAFE is free and all you have to do is turn up … but you haven't paid for it, you don't see it as something that makes a difference to you in your life; you don't see it as something valuable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that is not true for Shereen, who told us that free TAFE had been life changing. It's not true for Kirsty and Cristy, who are doing their Diploma of Nursing qualification through free TAFE in Queensland. It's not true for Lachlan, who did his cert IV through free TAFE and represented Australia at the WorldSkills championships in France alongside 1,400 competitors from 70 other nations. It's not true for Caitlin and Giselle, who are doing their health qualifications through Canberra Institute of TAFE, and Kayla in WA, who is set up for a career for the next 20 to 30 years. All the students I have met and all the students that my Labor colleagues have spoken to across Australia, from Cairns to Cottesloe, from Devonport to Darwin and everywhere in between, all value their studies and value the career opportunities that have opened up for them as a result. They value the TAFE teachers who have supported them and the fellow students that they've been learning with. So does Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A central tenet of the Labor Party is no-one held back and no-one left behind. There's a stark difference between Labor and the Liberals on TAFE and public education. For Australians, there's a choice. The Liberals have made it clear that under them there will be no free TAFE. They will cut funding to free TAFE. Despite the claims of the member for Farrer and those opposite, free TAFE is funded. It's funded through the 2024-25 MYEFO with a commitment of $253.7 million for 1½ years from 2027 and $177 million each year after that. Labor is making free TAFE permanent. It provides cost-of-living relief. It removes the debt burden that students can carry over the course of their lifetimes. It gives Australians the opportunity to obtain meaningful, secure and well-paid jobs. It delivers on our commitment that no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. It is building Australia's future and creating a better life for Australians. That's what the Free TAFE Bill is all about, and that's why I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2024 implements a number of public health measures intended to protect the integrity of Medicare, enhance the regulation of goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act and make minor amendments to the tobacco act. A number of these amendments form part of the response to recommendations of the Independent Review of Medicare Integrity and Compliance undertaken by Dr Pradeep Philip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Philip review identified a range of issues impacting the effective administration of health benefits schemes, including the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. As such, this bill is seeking to address some of the issues inhibiting the ability of the Department of Health and Aged Care to conduct efficient, timely and effective compliance activities. Given the widespread implications of this bill, the coalition will seek further scrutiny of its effect and implications through a Senate inquiry. While we support measures to strengthen the effective administration of Australia's important health benefits schemes, we want to ensure there are no unintended negative consequences created by this bill for Australia's hardworking healthcare professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to note during this discussion about Medicare integrity the Albanese Labor government's concerning record on Medicare to date. Labor went to the last election promising Australians they would strengthen Medicare, but over the last three years Medicare has only been weakened. GP bulk billing has fallen 11 per cent under the Albanese government to 77 per cent, whilst Australians are now paying the highest out-of-pocket costs on record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put this in perspective, the GP bulk-billing rate rose under Peter Dutton as health minister to 84 per cent. It continued to rise under the former coalition government to 88 per cent, before we left office. Again, it is now 77 per cent under Mark Butler and Anthony Albanese. In fact, Australians are now covering 45 per cent more of the cost to see a doctor from their own pocket under this government, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. This is forcing Australians to make the difficult decision between paying the bills and seeing their doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that 1.5 million Australians avoided going to a GP in 2023-24 due to cost concerns. That is a direct result of this government's mismanagement—its mismanagement of our economy and its mismanagement of Australia's health workforce crisis—which has meant that it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor. We know that this is only putting further pressure on Australia's struggling hospital system as Labor's primary care crisis pushes patients towards emergency departments. On the other hand, the coalition have put forward our plan to grow a strong pipeline of homegrown GPs and safeguard Australians' healthcare access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An elected Dutton coalition government will invest $400 million to provide junior doctors with direct financial incentive payments, assistance with leave entitlements and support for prevocational training. This will ensure junior doctors who pursue training as a GP in the community are not financially worse off compared to doctors who remain in the hospital environment. We understand that a strong pipeline of home trained GP graduates is critical to delivering essential health care to all Australians, and we are focused on further ways to ensure that all Australians have timely and affordable access to a doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, once again, the coalition supports the bill's aim to improve compliance activities in Australia's health benefits schemes. However, we condemn this government's concerning record on Medicare. That is why I will be moving a second reading amendment noting that Australians' access to affordable health care has only gone backwards under the Albanese Labor government, and it has never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor. I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"the House notes that under the Albanese Labor Government, Australians' access to affordable healthcare through the Medicare Benefits Schedule has only gone backwards, and it has never been harder or more expensive to see a GP".</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  Before I begin speaking on the Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2024, I have to call out the emotive, manipulative spin Labor uses in the health portfolio. This bill and Labor's track record demonstrate that outcomes do not match the pre-election rhetoric. Those of us on this side of the House believe in outcomes rather than spin. Labor's rhetoric about saving Medicare and celebrating anniversaries is desperate when you compare that to actual outcomes, because their record is not good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do they keep the Department of Health and Aged Care under the thumb and unable to provide us or the public with data on outcomes; they manipulate departmental resources to claim bulk-billing rates are improving. They're not. GP bulk-billing has fallen by 11 per cent to 77 per cent under the Albanese government, while out-of-pocket costs have increased by 11 per cent, and that is in the past year alone. To put this into perspective, the GP bulk-billing rate rose to 84 per cent under Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, as health minister, and it continued to rise cent under the former coalition government, getting to 88 per before we left office. Under the Albanese government, Medicare is currently covering the lowest percentage of GP fees on record. On average, Australians are being forced to cover 45 per cent more of the cost to see a doctor from their own pocket, in comparison to what they covered under the former coalition government. Labor love talking about when Mr Dutton was the health minister, but they don't like to talk about those facts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements measures intended to protect the integrity of Medicare, enhance the regulation of goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act and amend the tobacco act. Some amendments in the bill form part of the response to the recommendations of the Independent Review of Medicare Integrity and Compliance, undertaken by Dr Pradeep Philip. The Philip review identified potential improvements to administering health benefits schemes—in particular, the power to detect, respond to, investigate, disclose and deter misconduct, fraud and noncompliance. The bill seeks to address a range of impediments to the department conducting efficient, timely and effective compliance activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the widespread implications of this bill, the coalition is seeking further scrutiny of its effect and implications through a Senate inquiry. While we support measures to strengthen the effective administration of Australia's important health benefits schemes, including the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, we want to make sure that there are no unidentified negative consequences created by this bill for Australia's healthcare professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is rather ironic that this legislation aims to make efficiencies in the way Medicare works and improve its integrity, yet, under this government, wait times for Australians trying to access vital health services through Services Australia have blown out dramatically, with Australians waiting almost three times as long for PBS patient refunds to be processed. Now, who would have thought it! This Labor government is excellent with the headlines but not so great on the implementation. They are great at beating their chests and at two-word slogans with the word 'Medicare' in them but not great at beating the delays and delivering Medicare funded services to needy Australians, especially in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New data obtained by the opposition through Senate estimates reveals a massive spike in the time it took for the agency to process key health claims during a cost-of-living crisis. The new data also shows that more health claims in 2023-24 were completed outside the agency's own internal timeliness standard than not, with 8.3 million completed after the official deadline, compared with 5½ million claims completed on time. At that level, you could excuse Australians for thinking that, under Labor, waiting an inordinate amount of time for outcomes is the norm. In 2023-24, 77 per cent of all bulk-billing claims were completed past their official deadline, the second-worst result across Services Australia's entire health work program. Now, more than ever before, it is critical that the government ensure Australians can have their Medicare and PBS claims paid on time, but instead they have sent the system backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents in my electorate of Mallee have not seen improvements to Medicare under this government. Labor promised to strengthen Medicare, but they have weakened it. It has never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor than under the Albanese Labor government. Bulk-billing rates are falling, and the cost of seeing a doctor is rising. The bulk-billing data I gave earlier points to a primary care system at crisis point. When primary care becomes unaffordable, difficult decisions must be made in families and households and by individuals, regarding how to spend their limited resources. Australians are making the trade-off between paying their bills and seeing the doctor. Under the Albanese government, health costs have gone up by 10 per cent. We know that 1.5 million Australians avoided going to a GP in 2023-24 due to cost concerns. The proportion of people who reported that cost was a reason for either delaying seeing a GP or not seeing a GP when needed increased to 8.8 per cent in 2023-24 from seven per cent in 2022-23.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a concern not only in and of itself but also because people who do not receive the primary care they need in a timely manner often become sicker and need to access the hospital system, including overburdened emergency departments, when their symptoms become more severe. This is not good for patients, and it is costly for the health system. These circumstances are amplified in the regions, where the primary care system has long been stretched and is now approaching breaking point. People living in the regions, including in my electorate of Mallee, already have reduced access to primary care, rely more heavily on emergency departments and are admitted to hospital at a greater rate than those living in major cities. Worse still, those emergency departments are a long distance from where rural, remote and regional Australians live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this sitting fortnight, I visited the CareFlight helicopter that landed in Federation Mall to promote their work. Medical evacuation to capital cities for emergency treatment has become the norm in rural, regional and remote Australia. A 2023 report published by consulting firm Nous clearly articulated the relationship between Medicare Benefits Schedule, or MBS, expenditure; emergency department, or ED, presentations; and hospital separations. MBS expenditure reduces as you get more geographically remote, and, in concert, ED and acute hospital usage increases. When this existing system strain is coupled with the degradation that is occurring under the Albanese government, the outcome is magnified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in the regions are really doing it tough when it comes to getting the primary care they need and deserve, and this government has not done them any favours. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data corroborates this finding, illustrating that people living in outer regional, remote and very remote areas were more likely to report waiting longer than they felt acceptable for a GP appointment in 2023-24 than those living in major cities were—36.3 per cent compared to 26 per cent. They were also less likely to see an after-hours GP, 5.6 per cent compared to 3.9 per cent; and more likely to visit a hospital ED, 20.4 per cent compared to 13.8 per cent; or be admitted to hospital, 14.2 per cent compared to 12.1 per cent. Constituents regularly tell me of the significant challenges they face just getting to see a doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of their comments. 'There are no GPs in my town. The nearest is 70 kilometres away.' 'Our previous clinic closed, and it took six months to find a new GP clinic that would accept new patients. My family now has three different clinics between us, but we still do not have access to a regular doctor, because they keep leaving town.' 'The last doctor I was seeing left the nearest town. Now there are none taking new patients, so I see locums in a town further away.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians should be able to access the care of a GP when they need it, yet, under the Albanese government, this is becoming a pipedream for a few. There are just not enough GPs in the regions. This longstanding workforce crisis was amplified thanks to Labor bleeding the regions of doctors through the expansion of the distribution priority area, which funnelled international medical graduates into peri-urban settings. There is a significant and persistent maldistribution of the GP workforce, resulting in shortages in the regions, especially in small rural towns—and I have 72 in Mallee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small rural towns like Dimboola, in my electorate, have, on average, almost 60 per cent fewer health professionals than major cities do—just imagine. As older GPs retire, more young GPs are required to replace them as they're no longer willing to work the kinds of hours that were required in the past. One retiring GP might require two or even three younger GPs to cover their workload into the future. Then there is the issue of supervision. Younger GPs are pushing back against the requirement to supervise trainee GPs in their practices—and I have some in Mildura in exactly that position—in part because they are just not remunerated adequately for the time and energy involved to train the next generation of doctors to a high standard. It also takes them out of seeing their own patients. If you have a level 1 registrar, it requires for the GP—their supervisor—to sit with that registrar in every appointment. It's a requirement and it's needed, but the remuneration is not there to match the workload.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to mention—as time doesn't permit—the woeful approval times at Ahpra, on this government's watch, to get doctors up and running and practising here, which at times leaves our health services desperately short, as it did in Maryborough last year. These are key issues which must be addressed to make it easier for people in the regions to see a doctor, yet this government has been moving the dial in the wrong direction. I haven't even touched on the challenges posed by the higher costs of running a GP practice in the regions, including to fund locum doctors or incentivise GPs to move to an area by reimbursing relocation costs and providing subsidised housing. All this is coupled with patient populations who have lower incomes on average and, therefore, a reduced ability to pay out-of-pocket costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is crucial to Australia's healthcare system, and strengthening Medicare needs to be a top priority as Australians endure this cost-of-living crisis, because our healthcare system, as it stands right now, is struggling. It's becoming rarer by the day to find a bulk-billing GP, it's nearly impossible to access mental health care support without huge gap payments, and the cost of dental care has become so expensive that millions of Australians are putting it off entirely. A properly funded universal healthcare system actually saves the country money in the long run. It reduces poverty, creates jobs and drives economic productivity. It is achievable and desperately needed, as a matter of urgency, because everyone should be able to afford to go to the dentist when they need help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many Australians cannot access the dentist because it is too expensive, and more people are not eligible for public dentistry than ever before. As things stand, millions of Australians are putting off going to the dentist because they simply cannot afford it. It doesn't just lead to worse teeth; it leads to a host of other health concerns that also come from this lack of access. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I was really fortunate that, after I was elected to this place, I was able to afford, finally, to go to the dentist and get some fillings done, because I couldn't afford them while I was in my previous job, in retail. But, because I had waited so long, those fillings had become root canals, costing thousands and thousands more dollars than they previously would have. You shouldn't have to be elected to this place or rely on your income to be able to get access to life-saving and essential healthcare treatment, and that includes dentistry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the fortunate experience of growing up in the UK, where, up until the age of 18, all your dentistry and orthodontics are actually covered by the National Health Service. I was able to get my teeth looked after. I was able to get orthodontics done, all without costing my family a penny, which was an incredible experience. Then we moved over here, and my family had to pay about $4,000 in orthodontics to get my braces removed. That's a worlds-apart experience of engaging with the healthcare system—about what could be and what families could look forward to, compared to the situation that we find ourselves in in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we can't forget that, while Australians can't afford to go to a doctor or dentist in greater and greater numbers, we have one in three large corporations in this country paying no income tax. These large corporations can use all these various offsets and loopholes to get out of paying tax while everyday Australians cannot afford basic health care. The system is fundamentally broken, and we all know this. We all feel it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we fix this by changing the rules of the game. We make billion dollar companies pay their fair share of taxes so that we can expand Medicare to include dental care. In 2012, the Greens were able to secure dental care for kids into Medicare. In this term of parliament, we conducted the first Senate inquiry into access to dental care in Australia. In addition to expanding Medicare to include dental care, the Greens are calling on the government to create a chief oral and dental health care officer within the department of health, because having healthy teeth should not be a luxury in this country. Everyone should be able to use their Medicare card to go to the dentist when they need it. We have no other choice but to bring dental care fully into Medicare.</span>

I heard the member for Mallee speaking, before we drifted into Greens political party stunts, about the reality of Medicare. She kept saying, 'I need an apology from the Labor Party because bulk-billing rates aren't what they should be.' She failed to mention what they were when Labor came to office. She failed to mention the axe that had been taken to Medicare and to so many other aspects of the health sector by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison conga line of prime ministers. We know that in the coalition under those people we had some of the worst health ministers ever, and the current leader of the coalition in opposition was voted the worst health minister ever.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with my colleague from Brisbane and my next-door neighbour from Ryan that it would be great to bring oral health care into the public domain. It was envisaged by Labor prime ministers back in the forties and fifties. In fact, it was even put in the Constitution, and it was a unity ticket from both sides of the parliament; you had Labor and the coalition. So it is something that we'd like. I have been to QEII hospital, seen people at the emergency dental facility and seen the hell on earth that can be in terms of people trying to access oral health care when they can't afford it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do need to get the balance right, including by reforming the taxation system, especially the international taxation system, so that all corporations, big and small, pay the right amount of tax—their fair share of tax. We know what happens in those countries where they don't pay the right amount of tax. You end up stepping over homeless people everywhere you go. We know that corporations and individuals need to pay for our hospitals, for our GPs, for our schools, for our roads and for our defence forces—all of those things that make up a harmonious and modern society. But we do know, unfortunately, that 99.9 per cent—or whatever the percentage is—of our doctors, health professionals and nurses are all honest and hardworking and comply with the Medicare rules. We all know those people from the health profession that we interact with in our electorates. Obviously, they're a bit like MPs in that none of them ever knock on your door to tell you that everything's going great. When you see a health professional, it's normally because you're probably having your worst week or sometimes the worst day of your life.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, unfortunately, there are occasionally people who see the medical system as a business model to exploit rather than as an opportunity to provide care to Australians, and that's why this legislation is here. This legislation is all about strengthening Medicare so that the taxpayer funds paid by all 11 million or 12 million Australians who pay tax are well directed and properly utilised. Unfortunately, whenever it comes to big buckets of money, they attract ne'er-do-wells, criminals and shark practice. That's why this legislation is here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2022, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Mark Butler, commissioned a health economist, Dr Pradeep Philip, to look into Medicare in terms of integrity and compliance. In the last budget, the Albanese government funded the Medicare Integrity Taskforce to look at the findings and implement any recommendations coming out of that Philip review, and this legislation in front of us makes some minor amendments to the TGA's operation and to the government's vaping and tobacco reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation amends a couple of different acts. The amendments are all about protecting the integrity and supporting the ongoing sustainability of our health benefits schemes—the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. They're all expensive items in the budget, but there can be savings made by making sure that they are done efficiently. And, as I said, it's for that very, very small percentage of people, even doctors, who sometimes through circumstances end up doing the wrong thing or deliberately do the wrong thing—the people that are seeing 60 patients in an hour or something like that. I know it's a business, but sometimes people have to be set back on the right path. I should recognise, as there are doctors in the House, that there is an oversight body that makes sure GPs and other specialists are doing the right thing professionally, but it is the government's job to set up something to make sure medical practices are doing the right thing. The reality is that when I was born, nearly 60 years ago, most—</span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection from the honourable member. Nowadays, GPs or people working in the sector are mainly employees and are often employed by businesses that operate for profit. Caring and profit can go together, but melding those two concepts can be difficult. Sometimes the caring slips and the profit is what's focused on. Obviously, no medical practitioner dreams about doing more paperwork, but the modern medical process is all about records, being able to access data and the like. Often that is outsourced to professional businesses, and that's where some of the errors can develop. The Philip review made a couple of recommendations to make sure that we have more integrity in the Medicare system, and I commend this legislation to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  It's always a great pleasure to talk about Medicare and the importance of health. Getting health and other services into our area is something that I've been very passionate about, and this gives me a chance to remind the chamber of the last time we were in government, when we built superclinics throughout Australia. One of the great things about the superclinics was that they brought doctors together, brought allied services together and went into places where we had real issues in the medical workforce. Of course, the former government removed the District of Workforce Shortage classification from country areas, making it harder to attract doctors. One thing I'm always reminded of with that opposition over there is the Wallan superclinic. It has been open since we built it in 2013, but technically it was never opened, because the leader and deputy leader of the Liberal Party, who were the health ministers at the time, didn't want to do an official opening. That was because they could then stand back and say Labor had never delivered their 22 superclinics. That was the pettiness we had under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison mess. It's beyond belief that you wouldn't officially open something, because you wanted to use it as a political opportunity. It talks about just what those opposite think of Medicare and of our medical profession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Moreton rightly said, most of our doctors, nurses and health professionals are exemplary people and do absolutely amazing work. In the work I used to do with Ambulance Victoria I saw firsthand the ability of people to work in high-pressure, emergency and life-threatening situations. The care and compassion they showed was second to none. But, of course, we had 10 years when Medicare was attacked. There was an attempt to turn it into a profit-driven exercise through a GP tax by what the Australian Medical Association referred to as 'the worst health minister in living memory'. He is, of course, now the Leader of the Opposition. That leopard ain't changing its spots. We know that those opposite have no interest in protecting Medicare as an opportunity where it's your Medicare card that gets you service, not your credit card, as they don't think you'd value that service. They don't think Australians value Medicare if it's free. It's a slightly bizarre concept, but that's what you get with those sitting in the modern Liberal Party these days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time when, as the member for Moreton said, Medicare was a bipartisan issue, where people worked together and actually did that. But the change we've seen in the Liberal Party, which has pushed itself further and further to the knuckle draggers on the right, has meant that they've taken that away. That's why we see so many of these small-l liberal seats now occupied by Independents, because those Liberal members who would support free health care and unified health care and who have a social conscience have been pushed aside. It's a terrible thing we see happening. That's why it's important that we keep a government that actually cares about Medicare and cares about our doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first things we did when we got into government was address the workforce shortages after we had a committee, chaired by my friend and former colleague Peta Murphy, on the shortage of doctors in outer suburban and regional areas. We found that, for some stupid reason, those opposite wanted to treat areas like Wallan and Whittlesea the same as Brighton and Elsternwick. We still have that issue today of the hangover where we can't get doctors out. We're working closely with the states and with our local providers to actually get more doctors into our region. You should be able to see a doctor when and where you need to, and we should see more work being available for nurse practitioners. We should be able to see that, no matter where you are, you can get access to quality health care in your area when you need that service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Moreton said, there are a lot of new businesses these days that have started up. They're big companies that run medical practitioners and that actually do work doctors to the bone, and I don't think they treat them fairly. We see that happening in areas such as Mernda, where nearly every single practice is now owned by one company, and then they remove bulk-billing. That makes it hard for people who are doing it tough. And, of course, as anyone that's had kids knows, kids don't fall sick between nine and five. It's usually three in the morning when it's freezing cold and it's all a problem, and you've got to then travel for miles to try and find access to a medical professional. That's part of the reason those superclinic programs were so successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, as we head to the election, we'll be fighting very hard to get an urgent care clinic into the seat of McEwen. We know the importance of that. Through the redistribution, we've now lost our only hospital in that seat. It's now gone into Nicholls, so make sure you look after it, mate. It's a good hospital with great people, and they've done great service for years. But we need to get those services into those growing areas, throughout the northern suburbs, through Kalkallo and all the way up to Wallan, to be able to have services available. There are areas in the north-east of the electorate, like Diamond Creek and out that way, that also have difficulty getting access to doctors and health care. It's one of the most important things that we do, and the protection of Medicare is something that Australians value because Medicare means that we all get the opportunity to go and see a doctor or a nurse practitioner, who do great work, when we need to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've got to make sure we've got governments that back that in. The importance of having governments back that in means that we will get things like our superclinics and the change of the Monash medical rating done. In one town in McEwen, if you live at No. 82 and set up a practice, you're MM 2. If you go in at No. 84, you're on MM 3. It's a bizarre set-up. It's one small, little town, but a street divides the different ratings. I know that the health minister has been working diligently on this and I understand that it's not as simple an issue as just moving a line. I know that for each one of those towns there are probably hundreds of them around the country as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that's important about this bill is around moving in relation to tobacco and vapes, in particular, and the issues there. The bill also changes the timeframe during which Medicare claims for bulk-billed services may be made. The minister will keep discretion on how that service works. It's also important to note that what this is about is strengthening the integrity of Medicare and making sure that wherever you are, you will get access to doctors. You will get access to healthcare professionals. It's so important that this bill passes the House in a hasty manner.</span>

So, at this election, it's time to turf Labor out. On the ground, The Nationals have some incredible candidates who are leading this fight. As our man in Calare, Sam Farraway—he's a lifelong resident of the Central West and a former small business owner—brings a proud track record of community service, and, as a former state government minister, he knows how to deliver. Sam's vision for Calare is about authentic leadership, cost-of-living relief, securing a reliable energy future that doesn't destroy the landscape and getting us back to basics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In WA, we have Mia Davies running for the new seat of Bullwinkel. A former leader of the WA Nationals with more than 16 years of experience in the state parliament, Mia has a reputation for hard work and common sense. Quality access to education, health, child care and aged care is what drives her as our candidate in Bullwinkel. Over the next hundred days, the forgotten communities in the Perth Hills and outer suburbs have a chance to make history by electing Mia as their Nationals candidate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bendigo, we have the amazing Andrew Lethlean. Born and raised in Bendigo, Andrew's a local champion who, with a 22-year career in hospitality, has the business experience to make a difference in Canberra. Andrew knows that, when it comes to funding for roads and local projects, this region's been left behind by Labor. As the next federal member, Andrew Lethlean has the passion and commitment to get Bendigo back on track.</span>

I'm proud to be working with the ministers for defence, veterans, and northern Australia as a special envoy. A quick around-the-grounds: when it comes to the Army, it was a privilege to recently join our hardworking ADF recruiting team as they enlisted three Aboriginal Australians into the Army on the Australia Day public holiday. Thanks to all our public servants who are dutifully working on public holidays. The Air Force—thanks to the Spartan crew of No. 35 Squadron, who flew the Prime Minister, the infrastructure minister and me into Lake Nash Station, a cattle station in the Northern Territory, over Christmas. When it comes to the Navy, I was privileged to witness the commissioning of four Cape class patrol vessels at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Coonawarra</span> in Darwin. They are the backbone of our border protection. It was great to visit the future of the Australian Defence Force in the form of our cadets, the 71st Army cadet unit in Larrakeyah Barracks in my electorate. These children and young adults are the future of the Australian Defence Force. And finally, but certainly not least, there are the families. I look forward to meeting the newest Territory ADF families this weekend as we run the Welcome to Darwin event at the convention centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  It was back to school for so many of our children and teenagers last week, but for some it was the first day of their school and education life. For some there was anxiousness; for others, excitement; and, for all the preppies starting, the obligatory backpack that is almost bigger than them. Don't worry, kids; you'll grow into them! My mum was a state schoolteacher in grades one to three her entire life. I know and appreciate the unseen work that our schoolteachers do after hours. I can remember Mum getting home after four o'clock, cooking dinner for our family, making sure we got to bed and then starting lesson planning and marking before retiring for the night a few hours later. Mum also instilled a great value on learning the basics into my two brothers and me—much to our disgust because it interfered with our play and wrestling time. She ensured that, before we started school, we could write our names and do some basic maths, which I am now grateful for. </span>

I apologise to the other 28 primary schools in the great electorate of Longman that I couldn't get to. If any schools, mums or dads out there would like these charts so your kids can get ahead, please call into my office and pick one up. If you can't get in, then contact me and we'll get them out to you. All the best to all the preppies out there. I'm sure you'll do great, and well done to all our hardworking teachers. </span>

Congratulations to you all for your dedication towards creating a safer, supportive and thriving community. You are all local legends. Our sense of community is strong in Frankston, in Dunkley. It is evident in our schools, our sporting clubs, our volunteer organisations and our new citizens—all working together to make Dunkley a better place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Australia is facing a mental health crisis, and young men are on the front line. Two-thirds of men face challenges engaging with health care, 45 per cent drop out of therapy with unmet mental health needs and more than 2,400 men died by suicide in 2023, making it the leading cause of death among young men. Behind every heartbreaking statistic is someone's dad, someone's brother, someone's son or someone's colleague at work. These are people that I hear from almost every week, desperately seeking help in emergency departments, waiting for months to see a psychologist or having increasingly fraught encounters with police, where issues aren't treated and things get out of hand. These are people who are falling through the cracks in our mental health system, and we need to do more to help them. I commend the work of groups like Movember, who over many years has raised awareness about men's health issues and done incredible work to address them. I fully support Movember in this work.</span>

This is likely to cause a serious disruption in the care of some of the most vulnerable people in our community and is the result of a failure over many months to resolve workforce issues in the New South Wales mental health system. I urge the New South Wales government to urgently find a solution to ensure that appropriate care is given to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

I'm proud to have been one of them and have worked with some of the most dedicated and professional people you will ever meet—people who come into work every day to serve the national interest, keeping Australians safe, delivering the services they need and developing and implementing the policies and programs that impact the lives of every Australian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our city is home to 68,000 public servants, and Peter Dutton wants to cut 36,000 of them. Unlike the rest of the cuts he's planning, this one is no secret. They're really proud of this one and they're singing it from the rooftops. I even heard one of the members opposite yesterday interjecting that the first people they are coming for are the 36,000 Canberra public servants. Why? Because, like everything the Leader of the Opposition does, it's about politics rather than substance and it has no regard for the impact on the Australian people.</span>

But let's focus on that for a moment: the people in my city, their livelihoods, their families, the small businesses that rely on them and all the jobs in my city that will be affected. We will stand against these cuts because the Australian Public Service is important to all Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  We don't let Coles and Woolies make the laws about who can compete with them, but Labor and Liberal are close to stitching up a deal to stop communities choosing different representatives. The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024 was rushed through this House in November, and it's likely to hit the Senate in this sitting. If you look closely, it's about making voters pay more for less choice. We do need greater transparency and some sort of donation cap. Voters should know where the money comes from before they vote, and no-one should be able to personally influence the outcome of an election. But the bill also contains some really complicated spending caps that lock in the two-party system. Under the bill, ads about a party, not an individual, are not included in the electoral spending cap, so a party can massively outspend an Independent. And taxpayers will pay much more to the parties, so they'll have a war chest from the last election and new challengers will have nothing. The bottom line is that it's very complicated and could fundamentally change who can get into our parliament. If the government don't refer this bill to a committee, it's because they don't want voters to know how it will really work. Instead of changing the rules to lock out others, both major parties could try being better leaders.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Today I want to wish those in my electorate who celebrate a very happy lunar new year. In particular, I want to wish the Chinese residents of my electorate, especially members of the North Eastern Melbourne Chinese Association, NEMCA, a prosperous Year of the Snake ahead. The Chinese Australian community in my electorate is a small but vibrant one. Last year, I accepted NEMCA's invitation to celebrate the moon festival and China's national day with them. Last year was also the 30th anniversary of the founding of NEMCA, the first association in Victoria representing Chinese immigrants from mainland China and celebrating the achievements of Chinese migrants to our great multicultural story. NEMCA is one of the many organisations which provide space for different cultural recreational activities while offering essential services and support to immigrants adapting to life in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child of immigrants, I understand firsthand the challenge of building a new life in a foreign land. I grew up admiring the resilience of my own parents, whose sacrifices paved the way for the future for my sister and me, and I look up to their perseverance and strength. I'm eternally grateful for the sacrifices they made for us. The Chinese immigrants in my electorate know these sacrifices well—the challenge of adapting to the unfamiliar and the courage required to start anew. In my role as Special Envoy for Social Cohesion, it brings me great joy to see the ways in which NEMCA has promoted Chinese culture in Victoria. The work they've done to help Chinese immigrants transition smoothly into Australian society exemplifies the power of community and multiculturalism in our country. </span>

We know that what Labor wants to do—and is in the course of doing—is to put on 36,000 additional public servants at a cost of an extra $24 billion. Services Australia, for which he had responsibility, is at the epicentre of this. The headcount of Services Australia has gone up from 32,310 in 30 June 2022 to 33,554. So we've seen a strong increase in headcount, but service levels have gone down. The average time taken to process an age pension claim has more than doubled. In 2021-22, it took on average 35 days. In 2023-24, it took 76 days. The average wait time when you called the older Australians line was 14 minutes and 14 seconds in 2021-22 and 44 minutes and 31 seconds in 2023-24. So what is Bill Shorten's record? This is typical of Labor's approach to productivity in government. Productivity has collapsed. Services Australia has more staff doing less work, processing fewer overall claims. Service delivery outcomes have become worse. Do not believe this incorrect claim from the other side that there's a one-to-one correlation between people and outcomes; under Bill Shorten, it has been the reverse.</span>

As I said, I was very privileged to have been invited to the Vietnamese Community in Australia/SA Chapter, the South Australian Chapter, which hosted the Tet festival in my electorate with a particular theme this year. The theme was 'home away from home'. I suppose what they were showcasing was this wonderful community that they have established in South Australia in my electorate, in suburbs all over my electorate, but predominantly in Regency Park, Athol Park, Ferryden Park, Woodville North, Croydon, Croydon Park, Mansfield Park, Kilburn and Northfield. You'll find the Vietnamese community in every suburb in my electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have created a wonderful and enterprising community. There are a lot of startup businesses and restaurants et cetera. And this year is especially important because it marks 50 years since South Australia welcomed its Vietnamese boat people. We all remember that back in the seventies through to about the eighties over 100,000 Vietnamese boat people sought refuge here in Australia and have contributed so much over the years. Their contributions not only benefit the Vietnamese Australian communities but also enrich the lives of all Australians. I would like to thank the first female president of the organisation, Ms Quin Tran. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I opened social media this morning and was shocked by a post from the Prime Minister that said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No-one held back and no-one left behind. As Prime Minister, I've worked every day to make that a reality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Excuse me? Prime Minister, in what universe do you consider you have achieved that reality? It is certainly not the case in my northern Tasmanian community. Your talking points are not reality; they are smoke and mirrors. The reality is that the cost of absolutely everything has increased to the point that nothing seems affordable, and access to services is harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no child care to access, no matter how cheap you claim to have made it. Emergency food service providers are stretched beyond capacity, seeing working families having to choose between keeping rooves over their heads or feeding their kids. There is a level of housing insecurity and homelessness that I have never seen in my lifetime in northern Tasmania, with my office trying to assist young children sleeping in tents and cars.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has seen Centrelink, NDIS, aged-care and visa issues increase in the past 12 months. The people that we are seeing are absolutely being held back and left behind in all of these areas. Tasmanians don't need your empty words telling them they should be grateful they have never had it so good and that they should just trust you. They cannot wait for your words to be a reality; they need real action now.</span>

A re-elected Labor government will cut $5,500 from an average university student's debt and lock in free TAFE permanently. This plan will benefit the constituents of Bean and people throughout Australia to make ends meet and get ahead, as well as ensure we have the skills we need. It will put money back in the pockets of constituents who are often facing a host of financial pressures when starting out in their working lives. Importantly, it will increase the attractiveness of pursuing higher education and training, which is essential to the future of the ACT and our nation more broadly. The Albanese government is rightly putting students and trainees centre stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also welcome news that one of the Albanese government's 10 new regional education university hubs will be on Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is 2½ hours by air to Sydney or Brisbane airports, let alone to their university campuses. With the new Canberra Institute of Technology being built by the ACT government in the Woden valley—in the heart of Bean—and the Prime Minister's plan to cut the costs faced by those pursuing higher education and training, we know that education is the best weapon to fight disadvantage. I am pleased that, with the support of Labor governments at all levels, we are providing students and trainees with the opportunity to build a better future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  You've probably heard of a Men's Shed, but have you heard of a Women's Shed or a 'she shed'? I recently had the opportunity to catch up with some of the ladies from the Biggenden Women's Shed. This terrific group connect, create and thrive, creating a connected community and a welcoming space where local women can pursue a variety of recreational and personal development activities. It's a safe place for women to focus on their needs and build supportive friendships with women of all life stages and backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This shed is the first of its kind in the region, with members coming from a variety of communities. It was lovely to catch up with these fantastic ladies and hear about their exciting plans to develop a space of their own for local women to utilise and their need for fencing and gates to surround their shed. That's something I will be fighting for as the member for Flynn. One of the issues they brought up with me is that Women's Sheds can apply for general community funding grants but have no funding programs specifically for them as Men's Sheds do. The Minister for Women, Ms Gallagher, has been silent on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's Sheds matter, and that is why I'm calling on the Labor government to support Women's Sheds in the same way that Men's Sheds are supported. Women's Sheds matter.</span>

While the Liberals plan to hand out tax cuts to the wealthy and fund luxurious lunches for business owners, Labor is delivering real relief to working Australians, especially those in the outer suburbs who are feeling the pain of cost-of-living pressures.</span>

That's why Labor has delivered a tax cut for every single taxpayer, $300 in Commonwealth energy bill relief and cheaper child care. Labor has wiped billions off student debt, delivered pay rises for aged-care workers and early childhood educators, delivered fee-free TAFE and—that's not all—delivered cheaper medicines. Every one of these policies is making a difference to families in our community, and every single one of these policies has been opposed by Peter Dutton.</span>

Her words, along with slogans from the energy minister, highlight the shallowness of the energy debate in Australia and the air of unreality that some members exist in. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The old-fashioned concept of base load power is proving to be more and more a thing of the past.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said it's 'an antiquated idea'. I was standing in an apple orchard for my cross and I asked how those apples would be refrigerated 24/7 without base-load power. Thousands of workers in my electorate depend on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, along with inane comments by the energy minister such as 'the sun and the wind don't send bills', attempts to dumb down a complex issue. It's hugely expensive and disruptive to harness and distribute this energy, and it is, by its nature, intermittent. It's necessary for us to analyse very real problems with the life cycle emissions of renewable infrastructure projects, with emissions not reducing but shifting offshore due to reckless policies, and with how industries that require 24/7 or base-load power will receive that power at a price that enables them to remain competitive and operating in Australia. There are no convincing answers in relation to these problems, only an integrated system plan that has more holes in it than the colander in my kitchen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the regions are, therefore and understandably, very frightened of a minority Labor government controlled by the Greens and teals, who tend towards the luxury of what they want to believe and not the scientific, engineering and economic realities that we face as a nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  If Labor are re-elected, we are cutting a further 20 per cent off student debt. In New South Wales—that includes, of course, the Blue Mountains, the Hawkesbury and the plains—university students and graduates will see an average of $5,703 wiped from their HECS debt. If you have a student debt of $50,000, that will mean a cut of $10,000. Whether you are still at uni or in other tertiary studies or have long since finished, that 20 per cent will disappear from your debt, and we know that'll make a real difference.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing cost-of-living relief by letting you wait until you're earning more before having to start paying your HECS debt off. The threshold for repayments will lift from about $54,000 to $67,000, and so, for someone on $70,000 a year, that means you'd pay around $1,300 less a year in repayments. This is on top of our reforms that have fixed the indexation formula, cutting around $3 billion from student debt, with most people receiving their credit or their refund last December. All up, the Albanese Labor government will cut close to $20 billion in student loan debt for more than three million Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's compare that to the Liberals. The opposition leader says he'll scrap our plan, and that means, if you've got a student debt or your kids or your grandkids have a student debt, you'll be worse off under the Liberals.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  The Prime Minister promised Australia cheaper child care. He promised a pay rise for 200,000 educators by the end of the year. But just like all of his other promises, like no changes to superannuation, no changes to the stage 3 tax cuts and—who can forget?—cheaper power bills, he has failed to deliver for Australians. Under Labor, the cost of child care has risen by 22.3 per cent, and the latest inflation data shows that, since Labor's changes to the childcare subsidy, out-of-pocket fees have skyrocketed by 12.7 per cent. Meanwhile, they've completely bungled the worker retention payment, with just 15 per cent of educators to receive the pay rise. Labor is failing educators and failing Australians. Labor is spending $15 billion on early childhood education, but guess what? They haven't delivered a single new place for families with little to no access, and child care is more expensive. Now their plan is to add more demand into a system that is struggling, a system that is at capacity, because Labor have failed to get the policy settings right. This is a government with no meaningful policies to address the issues of access, affordability and quality in the sector, only bandaid solutions. We have a government chasing headlines and not delivering substance. Australian families deserve to know: why do they always pay more under Labor?</span>

The coalition are proposing to go to the election without telling the voters of Australia any detail except that there will be secret cuts. the coalition's secret cuts. But these cuts are not just a line item in the budget. They are 36,000 real people, all of whom we know. So who gets cut? Will it be our neighbour working at the counter at Centrelink in Midland, or the uncle on the phone at the Cannington call centre right now, talking to pensioners in Hasluck? Who gets cut? Will it be your dedicated brothers and sisters working at the NDIS in Morley, actively working to help mums and dads ensure that their children have the care and support they need? Who gets cut? Surely it won't be the hundreds of newly employed public servants who are working on claims for the veterans from the Ellenbrook RSL right now, after being long neglected by the opposition. Who gets cut in the coalition's secret cuts? Who gets cut, and why the secrecy? Tell my constituents, the people of Hasluck, what you intend to cut from them. What don't they deserve?</span>

In fact, there have been hundreds of failures by this Albanese Labor government. No.1, they wasted 18 months of government and $500 million on their failed Voice campaign while ignoring the cost of living. No. 2 is the out-of-control spending that's fuelling inflation and keeping prices high. Even the RBA has acknowledged the homegrown inflation problem. Under Labor, we've had 12 interest rate hikes. The PM promised we'd actually have mortgage relief; that hasn't happened. The PM promised 97 times to reduce energy bills by $275. Instead, they've risen by a thousand dollars. No. 5, their weakness has allowed antisemitism to flourish in Australia. I feel so sorry for the Jewish community, under Labor. Sadly, 27,000 businesses have become insolvent under Labor. You can't forget Labor's immigration chaos, which has seen record-breaking migration fuelling the housing crisis. No. 8, you can't leave out Labor's release from detention of 215 dangerous, foreign-born criminals. And guess what? The minister in charge then got promoted by the Prime Minister. Go figure that one. And, back in 2022, the PM promised life would be easier under him. Well, it's not. We can't afford three more years of this weak Labor government and weak Labor Prime Minister.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  Last week we saw more reckless comments from this Leader of the Opposition. This time around, as part of another shameless attempt to put his values above everyone else's, he's targeted workers in the Public Service. He has deemed their efforts, as well as the livelihoods of the Australians who depend on them, wasteful. Again, this is an opposition leader that has no idea about communities like mine, where tens of thousands of households rely on federal government services like the NDIS and Centrelink, and I have serious concerns in particular about the effect his ideology will have on veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government inherited a backlog of nearly 42,000 DVA claims left sitting there by the Liberals. As of the end of last year, the DVA estimates that 97.7 per cent of those claims have been cleared under Labor's watch. How did we do that? We backed our Public Service. We gave the department the staffing and resources it needed to get those claims done because our veterans need those entitlements. We did that because the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide made abundantly clear the results of a DVA that doesn't work. We know that; the opposition leader knows that, too. For him to threaten to bulldoze our Public Service just to put his image ahead of veterans and other everyday Aussies is absolutely disgraceful. It's a policy that only leads to cuts, job losses and long lunches for the bosses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 11 October 2024, of the Honourable Anthony (Tony) John Messner AM, a former Minister and Senator for the State of South Australia from 1975 to 1990, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the moment he was elected as a senator for South Australia in the double dissolution election of 1975, Tony Messner was regarded as a person of conviction. In the words of one biographer, he was someone who ran for parliament 'because they held a set of beliefs, not because they were about appeasing interest groups or devising policies with the aid of opinion polls'. This is why Tony Messner was respected by all in the House and Senate, including by his Labor opponents, and is one of the many reasons he was cherished by his Liberal colleagues, from those who he served alongside—especially his Canberra flatmate and friend, John Howard—to those he mentored, including former premier of New South Wales Barry O'Farrell. Indeed, Barry would later pay Tony that great compliment unique to politics, saying, 'He taught me how to count.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1980, Malcolm Fraser promoted Tony to assistant treasurer and Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Having begun his working life in banking and then training as a chartered accountant, Tony Messner was known as someone with a passion for economic policy, tax reform and small business, but it was in the veterans' affairs portfolio that he faced his most significant challenges and arguably made his most important contribution. He created a national network of counselling centres with a particular focus on supporting the generation of veterans who had returned from Vietnam. He also drove significant change to repatriation legislation, including recognising the war service of Australia's merchant mariners, and he expanded eligibility for those who served in peacekeeping missions. Tony's words—and these still ring with truth—were:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is an historical tradition to compensate those who have served … The philosophy is no less valid now than when it was born during the First World War. It is a philosophy which reflects the very best of the Australian character, that is, helping those in need, standing together in times of need and making sure that useful people are not thrown on the scrap heap before their time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A former prop for the Western Australian under-19s rugby team, Tony Messner's burly frame once saw him described by <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> journalist Ian Warden as 'the Mal Meninga of the Senate'. I should emphasise that this was in the year that Mal was leading the Raiders to their first grand final, so there's probably no finer tribute that any Canberran could offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Tony Messner's time in the front row of political contest came to an end in 1990, he continued to serve Australia. He was of course the Administrator of Norfolk Island from 1997 to 2003, a role that he performed with enthusiasm and distinction. We honour his contribution to our parliament and to our nation, and we offer our sympathies to his loved ones, friends and colleagues. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his kind words, and I honour him in honouring the life of Anthony John Messner AM. Tony was born to South Australian parents, but, as a child, teenager and young man, Tony lived in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. His father's job as a bank officer meant that the Messner family was constantly on the move. It's one reason why Tony, contrary to his South Australian roots, took a shine to rugby union. The other reason was that the young man was gifted with the well-built frame of a front rower. Indeed, as the Prime Minister pointed out, his talent saw him play at the highest level, representing Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following in his father's footsteps, he took up a career in banking. Banking brought him back to Adelaide before he moved to Mount Gambier. There, he worked as a chartered accountant and was secretary of the local chamber of commerce. Having settled in SA, Tony married Louise Ahrendt in 1963, with whom he had two sons. He later married Robyn Rooke, in 1983, and it was in Mount Gambier that Tony began his political career. Between 1964 and 1975, he rose through the ranks, from Young Liberals vice president to serving as a member of the state council and the state executive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony was driven by what he saw as the basic truth of Liberal philosophy: to maintain freedom and to provide equal opportunity for all. Like many seeking political office, Tony was initially unsuccessful. In 1972 he lost out in preselection to contest the lower house seat of Davenport in South Australia. In 1974 he missed out on an upper house seat in Canberra, being fifth on the ticket. But, after the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975 and Malcolm Fraser's largest majority victory in Australian history, Tony won a South Australian Senate seat. For the next three elections that he contested, he was top of the SA ticket, serving the state he loved for 14 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Characteristic of many maiden speeches of past times, Tony avoided delving into his personal background. Instead, he devoted almost all of his words to discussing the issues that he was most passionate about—none more so than small business. It was typical of a man who, as one journalist later described, was willing to make the most of it in a quiet way. Not only did the former banker and chartered accountant understand small business, but the new senator saw it as his duty to champion small business. Indeed, in Tony, small business had an indefatigable champion. Tony was a person who said of small business that it's the start of new ideas and a breeding ground for new industries, which creates more jobs and more wealth. For these reasons, he said, small business is big business in Australia. He delved into many issues facing the sector, such as creating credit, financing, asset depreciation and an inadequate taxation system. He proposed that small businesses would be better served by the establishment of an independent statutory watchdog in place of the then government-run advisory bureau. In his maiden speech of 1976, he said that small business was the key to economic success, and he was dead right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his first years as a senator, he was outspoken on economic issues. To read his views today, be they on inflation, spending, taxation or industrial relations, is to have a <span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ack to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">F</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uture</span> moment. With his economic acumen, Tony was appointed in 1980 as the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, where he passed important legislation to deal with tax avoidance. Tony Messner shared more than a portfolio with his Treasurer, the young John Howard. During sitting weeks in Canberra, they shared a flat together, with political life and lodging leading to a lifelong friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1980 Malcolm Fraser also made Tony his Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It was a tough time to oversee that portfolio, with many veterans of the Vietnam War beset by physical and psychological trauma for the rest of their lives from that service. Agent Orange was also a major public issue. Commendably, Tony established counselling centres for veterans in capital cities in every state and in the Northern Territory. Moreover, he also undertook a review of repatriation laws. Thanks to the legislative amendments that he introduced, Tony brought about an end to the discriminatory way in which veterans of different conflicts received different benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the defeat of the Fraser government in 1983, Tony spent the next six years in various shadow portfolios under opposition leaders Andrew Peacock and John Howard. Among those appointments, Tony was given responsibility for social and community services, and he took the fight up to the Hawke government for its introduction of an assets test, which was detrimental to age pensioners. Promoted to shadow cabinet as spokesman on finance and taxation, Tony campaigned vigorously against the government's fringe benefits and capital gains taxes, and he kept up his energy on the debate, undeterred by leaks from his own side to the ABC. Indeed, Tony's ideas about a tax system that sought to encourage self-reliance over dependence and that promoted freedom of choice for families became hallmarks of the Howard government for more than a decade later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony believed government ought to be out of people's pockets and, as much as possible, not in them. As shadow minister for public administration, he sought to bring about changes in the Public Service to address waste and inefficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon his retirement, Tony may have hoped for more time to indulge in his diverse interests, ranging from risk management to the American Civil War, but his postpolitical life saw him on the move once again. In '97, he was appointed Administrator of Norfolk Island, and there a holidaying John and Janette Howard visited Tony and Robyn Messner, and there we can imagine friends and former flatmates reflected on their political fates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Tony's wife, Robyn, and the Messner family. May Tony Messner rest in peace.</span>

I've said that the government has two priorities. The first is keeping Australians safe. The second is making sure that the ongoing investigation, which is ongoing, prioritises not just capturing those people who have been involved—and there are, of course, at least two people who are in custody publicly. But, in order to ascertain who is behind this, it is absolutely critical that the AFP, the state police agencies, ASIO and the intelligence agencies be allowed to do their work, and the federal government will provide every support for them. </span>

Indeed, my government is building Australia's future by strengthening Medicare, prioritising support for people to get the health care they need when they need it and where they need it—they will just need their Medicare card in order to get it. That's our priority. Government is about making decisions about priorities of expenditure. That's why $1.7 billion of additional funding for public hospitals just in the next year will make an enormous difference. That's our priority, not long lunches, but helping people with the health care they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This funding will help to cut waiting lists. It will reduce waiting times in emergency rooms, and it will manage ramping. This will save lives. All of the states and territories that we've engaged with over recent days have welcomed this announcement, and I congratulate the health minister on the work that he has done to deliver this. This is just part of our plan—better support for our public hospitals but also support for primary health care so that the pressure is taken of those emergency departments. That's why the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive was so important. That's why 87 Medicare urgent care clinics are providing the care that people need for free. Over one million Australians, one-third of whom were under the age of 15, have visited those urgent care clinics when they've needed them. They're right across the board. These haven't got a colour coded spreadsheet to decide where they are; they have been provided in regional Australia, in our suburbs and in our towns, right throughout the entire country. They have delivered over one million free doctors' appointments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new agreement increases the Commonwealth contribution to state-run hospitals over the next year by 12 per cent to a record of almost $34 billion. That stands in stark contrast—I'm asked about alternatives. The last time the coalition got into government, they tried to rip $50 billion from public hospitals, they wanted a GP tax every time people visited a doctor, and they wanted a payment to be made when people visited the emergency departments of public hospitals as well. On Sunday the Leader of the Opposition made clear that the cuts are coming. He won't tell you where they are coming till after the election, but we know that he's had health in his sights before, and we know it will be in his sights again. </span>

When he goes beyond giving the date, which is what we've asked—you say that can't be done, and we take your advice in relation to that—how is it possible for him then to be broad ranging even on this topic without you bringing him into line?</span>

                  </a>  The member is correct; the Prime Minister can't stray into other topic areas. But, as the Prime Minister was speaking when the manager took the point of order, he was talking about security agencies, a briefing and involvement around the issue. That, under the standing orders, makes his answer directly relevant. As I said before you interrupted me, if there were another topic that he was to enter into—the cost of living, for example—you could get my assurance that I would make sure the Prime Minister was being directly relevant. But, on any objective ruling also made for any previous Speaker, he's talking about the topic. Under the standing orders, as long as he is remaining directly relevant to the topic, he's in order. The Prime Minister has the call.</span>

                  </a>  The response that brought an objection from the Manager of Opposition Business was to offer a briefing. I wouldn't have thought that that was provocative. I would have thought that, on this issue, it's pretty handy to find out the facts. It's pretty handy to get a response, because this is the issue here—you know what the Australian people want to know? They want to know who's behind this. They want to know who is engaged in antisemitic attacks. They want to know if people have been paid. They want to know where that trail leads. And they want intelligence agencies to be able to do that work without political interference and without political gains. That is what they want here. But the priority of those opposite is to play political games.</span>

That's what my priority is, too. The way you keep them safe is by having confidence in our national security agencies and making sure that they can engage in the sort of intelligence where, if you look at the people who have been in custody, you then look for what is behind that. And surely the idea that that's where it stops is quite frankly not the case, and the police have continued to be responsible for what is made public. I will leave them to do their job. And you know what? I will back them doing it, unlike those opposite, who just want to play politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:26</span>):  I thank the member for Lingiari not just for her question but for organising our visit to the Alice Springs Hospital in December, where I had the pleasure of meeting the extraordinary team that works in the emergency department there—one of the outstanding EDs that I have visited in my time. The Alice's is one of 700 public hospitals in Australia. They employ about half a million hardworking doctors, nurses, health professionals and support staff. For 41 years—Saturday was the 41st birthday of Medicare—a core Medicare principle has been the assurance that every Australian can access high-quality care in a public hospital completely free of charge. You simply can't have a strong Medicare without strong public hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a terrific public hospital system in Australia, staffed by probably the best-trained health workforce on the planet, but the truth is it's a system under very serious pressure. We're getting older as a population. We have more complex chronic disease. We have a serious legacy from the COVID pandemic and, frankly, more broadly in the healthcare system we are dealing with a decade of cuts from those opposite when they were in government. The existing public hospital funding arrangements simply are not fit for purpose. That's why we've been investing in urgent care clinics. That's why we've invested in state government initiatives to move longer-stay older patients out of the hospital system. But, in terms of public hospital funding, wage and activity pressure for hospitals means that right now the Commonwealth share of the hospital budget is declining. It's going to fall well below 40 per cent if we don't do something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we are determined to be a reliable partner. That's why the Prime Minister today announced a $1.7 billion additional funding commitment by this government for the next financial year for every state and territory and that we would keep negotiating a longer term five-year funding agreement with them. This will be especially good for the NT because, for over a decade, the NT has been chronically underfunded by the Commonwealth. This government will be the first government determined to fix that. The Northern Territory's funding from the Commonwealth will increase next year by 30 per cent, and the member for Solomon and the member for Lingiari have been arguing strongly for that for some considerable time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked if there are any approaches that would leave Australians worse off. Well, perhaps the approach of the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister might be instructive. Although he promised there would be no cuts to health in 2013, in 2014 he tried to rip $50 billion out of our public hospital system. His approach this year is a little different. He admits there will be cuts; he just won't tell people what they will be. We know what they will be, because this man favours long lunches over public hospitals and he needs to find $600 billion for nuclear power stations. He will come after Medicare again; you can be sure of that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for her question. I know how seriously she takes these issues of connectivity in her community. I also want to take the opportunity to extend my appreciation to members across the chamber, particularly in regional areas right across the aisle who prior to the 3G switchover assisted in disseminating important information about that to their local communities, which is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For context, the spectrum is what we call a scarce resource. It's used but not consumed. It's valuable. It can be redeployed in other ways, and the evolution of the various forms of mobile technology, from CDMA to 2G and now the 3G network being switched over, enables the refarming of that spectrum to ensure that it's capable of doing more and actually delivering technical benefits. But you are right that those technical benefits won't be realised if people don't have coverage under that new technology. This was also the first switchover to occur during what we call the 'internet of things', where there are so many connected devices and so many people are reliant on it. So I completely acknowledge the member's concern. It is very real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 December, I convened industry regulators, mobile carriers and consumer groups to look at the lessons learned from the 3G switchover, and I can give her some insights into what we are doing following that. The government has stressed to the carriers that the benefits of the 3G switchover really need to be demonstrated, and, whilst it is a fact of physics that the switchover is complete, there needs to be a focus now on the consumer welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member is right. It is very true that there are multiple complaints from customers, particularly in regional areas, who've seen fortuitous coverage diminished and who have seen their services overall being challenged. The question is: how can that be improved? I'm happy to inform the member that, whilst it is obviously concerning to hear those reports happening in regional areas, I am monitoring this very closely. I've made the expectation that the 3G switchover would deliver on these benefits clear to service providers. The ACMA and the ACCC have been highlighted in this, not only in terms of the technical requirements, but also for the representations that are being made to customers about coverage pre and post switchover, because, as many consumers know, those coverage maps don't always match what they actually receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll take this opportunity to highlight that Telstra has now established a dedicated 3G helpline. The number is 1800990853, and I have formally requested weekly reports from the carriers so I can continue to monitor this. I remind members that, if they do have particular concerns, my door is open. I'll be happy to meet with the member after this so we can go through that, but that's open to all members in this place.</span>

When that side of the House is focused on long lunches, cuts, conflict and culture wars, this side of the House has maintained a focus on the cost of living. Because of that focus, inflation is down, wages are up and unemployment is low. We've delivered two surpluses and we're rolling out cost-of-living help. We're making substantial and now sustained progress in the fight against inflation, but we know that people are still under pressure, and that's why there is still more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the same Australians would be thousands of dollars worse off today if the opposition leader had his way on tax cuts, on wages, on energy rebates and on cost-of-living help. We also know they'll be worse off still if he wins the election and goes after Medicare again, goes after wages again and pushes up electricity prices with his nuclear madness. That's why two revelations in the last few days are very important. The first one is that the long lunches policy would cost Australian workers more than $10 billion a year to subsidise long lunches and entertainment if every business claimed what they were entitled to. He wants lower wages for workers and longer lunches for bosses and he wants taxpayers to foot the bill. The second revelation is he has big cuts in mind but he won't tell Australians what they are until after the election. We know that from his <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> interview. His secret cuts and his warped priorities should send a shiver up the spine of every worker, of every student, of every family, of every pensioner in this country.</span>

But you can't have a question simply asked about the opposition, so the opposition manager is correct. To talk about the approaches, the Treasurer has to talk about what the government is doing as well. I'm just going to make sure for the remainder of his answer, if he is doing approaches about what would leave Australians worse off, that he explains that in the context of the government policy as well.</span>

                  </a>  That's why I began by saying under this government inflation is down, wages are up and unemployment is low, and that's been deliberate. And there is an alternative over there. Those opposite think there's $350 billion in cuts ripe for the picking in the budget. Australians should know that the $350 billion in cuts includes pension indexation, natural disaster funding, hospitals and bulk billing, housing, TAFE and support for veterans. They are coming after all of that, but they'll tell you about it later. They won't come clean on costs or cuts, and that puts every Australian at risk. Another reason why this matters and why the contrast is so important is that he needs to find $600 billion for this nuclear insanity. He has to find it somewhere, and last time he went after Medicare. It's a stark choice at the election this year: a coalition of cuts and conflict and culture wars making Australians worse off and taking the country backwards, or this Prime Minister and this Labor government getting inflation down, helping with the cost of living and building Australia's future.</span>

Premier Minns was open and honest with the people of New South Wales when he briefed and provided confidence to the public in declaring what date he'd been advised of the planned terrorist attack by this unknown organisation or people or individuals. The Prime Minister has been embarrassed, because he wasn't advised by the police because they were worried about him leaking the information ahead of any action by the police.</span>

                  </a>  I'm happy to assist. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, Premier Minns was open, honest and transparent with the people of New South Wales when he declared that on 20 January he was advised by New South Wales police about the planned terrorist attack. The Prime Minister has been asked on multiple occasions to be honest, open and straightforward with the Australian public as to why he wasn't notified. The Prime Minister has previously advised dates on which he's been notified of serious events by the Australian Federal Police. Why can't the Prime Minister just be honest with the Australian people?</span>

                  </a>  There are two choices you can make here. One is to prioritise getting to the bottom of what is happening here, supporting the police and intelligence agencies, or you can choose to play politics and play these games, and that is precisely what you are doing. You haven't asked for a briefing from the security agencies. When I offered a briefing of the security agencies to others, you didn't take that up. Indeed, you had an objection to a point of order to that, as well. AFP Operation Avalite has successfully made one arrest. They have joint counterterrorism teams operating. There have been 180 arrests in New South Wales. Twelve people have been charged in Queensland, 13 in South Australia, and two today in Western Australia. That is the hard work that is being conducted by our police and security and intelligence services. The idea that that is not the priority and that that should not be my focus is quite frankly absurd—absurd and irresponsible. And there are others on that side who know how irresponsible it is. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  I thank the wonderful member for Robertson for their question. The member for Robertson understands, as do we on this side of the House, that, when we talk about early childhood education and care, we're talking about an essential service. It's a service that families rely on to study, to work, and to pay the household bills. That's why the Albanese Labor government is undertaking reform of the sector, based on three key pillars: affordable early learning, a strong early childhood education and care workforce and a system that's accessible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, our reforms have delivered real cost-of-living relief for Australian families. In fact, more than one million families have benefitted from our cheaper childcare reforms, a commitment that we made before we came into government. A family earning $120,000 a year, accessing 30 hours of early learning a week, has saved around $2,768 since September 2023. But we know that there is more to do, and today I introduced the Early Childhood Education and Care (Three Day Guarantee) Bill 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will guarantee families at least 72 hours of subsidised early learning a fortnight, and for First Nations families this increases to 100 hours of subsidised early learning a fortnight. Our guarantee replaces the Liberals' activity test, which locked out families and did nothing to increase workforce participation. That's because only an Albanese Labor government understand that quality early learning provides the opportunity to improve a child's lifelong trajectory, and we believe that there should be no barriers to opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three-day guarantee will mean real cost-of-living relief for over 66,000 families, saving them an average of around $1,370 per year. About half of those families earn less than $100,000. Lower-income families get to save even more, an average of around $1,460 a year. It also means that over 100,000 families can get more subsidised hours of early childhood education and care if they want or need it. This bill will help parents get back into the workforce and give meaningful support to families struggling with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am asked about risks, and the risks are right there on the coalition benches. The Leader of the Opposition has confirmed he's going to make huge cuts, but Australians won't know what those cuts are until after the election. We're taking action to deliver cost-of-living relief for families. The Leader of the Opposition wants to gift his business mates free lunches. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's not to try to find and hunt down the perpetrators, not to make sure that the perpetrators are held to account, not to find out who is behind the front people, not to discuss or get a briefing of intelligence. Well, I stand with the AFP and ASIO and the ASD and all those who are working so hard to hold these people to account and to ensure that either the perpetrators themselves or those behind antisemitic attacks are held to account, arrested, charged and put in the clink. That is my priority. The opposition leader is showing what his priority is here today, and it is all wrong.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CLARE:</span>
                  </a>  We said when we were elected that we would cut the cost of child care, and that's what we've done. We've cut the cost of child care for more than a million Australian families. The average family have saved more than $2,000 in the last 12 months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we'll help more kids who are currently missing out, because this year we'll roll out a $1 billion fund to build more childcare centres where they're needed: in the suburbs, in the regions and in the bush. That got the backing, this week, of the National Farmers Federation. They said yesterday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We implore the Coalition to match Labor's $1bn 'building early education fund' to build more than 160 new childcare centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the farmers get it but the Nationals and the Liberals don't. They've spent 2½ years in this joint talking about childcare deserts. They spent a decade in government doing nothing about it. And now there's a billion-dollar fund on the table, and they're turning their backs on the bush again. Instead, they've come up with something else they want to spend the money on. Instead of building childcare centres in the bush, they want to fund long lunches for inner-city bosses. That's what they want to do. Forget kids in the childcare deserts. They want to fund long lunches and bosses' desserts.</span>

                  </a>  He said Australia can't afford that. But apparently Australia can afford at least $1.6 billion a year for every boss to go out to lunch. That's the choice: Escargot for CEOs or early education for our kids? Helping our kids get a great start in life or helping bosses get a great starter at half price? I think I know which one parents are going to pick. They're going to pick their kids. They're going to pick education, not this cockamamie long lunch idea from a bunch of Scott Morrison leftovers. This doesn't belong in a budget; it belongs in the bin.</span>

                  </a>  The clock has indicated that the Prime Minister has been speaking for about 17 seconds. I heard—because there was quite a lot of interjection—about the AFP and ASD. They were the only key takeaways I heard so far. I would have to say he is being directly relevant, because I don't know if he's going to release the date that you wish him to. One point of order has been taken within 17 seconds of this question. It would be very hard for someone to get up and say, 'Is the Prime Minister being relevant,' because we've executed that. I'm just going to assist the House and ask the Prime Minister to be directly relevant for the remainder of his two minutes and 42 seconds.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I was asked a question about the police and agencies, and I was speaking about the police and agencies. I'm for them, and we on this side are for them. It's as simple as that. We have confidence in them to do their work, and we will back them in doing their job. That is what we will do—continue to engage information that is made public that they make decisions about. For example, on the day of the Maroubra child care incident, the AFP made it clear that it was their view that people were being paid to engage in some of these antisemitic actions. If people who are criminals are being paid, maybe it's a good idea to use intelligence to find out who's paying them. Maybe that's the priority—not this political game-playing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite, on a day on which we've announced $1.7 billion of additional health funding, of course can't ask any questions about health. They can't ask any questions about education or TAFE on a day on which the parliament has passed free TAFE. They can't ask any questions about the cost of living, even though they say that's the No. 1 priority, because the only policy they have is free lunches. That's why they're reduced to criticising and undermining the work of our police and our security agencies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  I thank the member for Paterson, who is not only a champion of regional New South Wales but a champion for free TAFE. She knows—she celebrates the fact—that free TAFE has delivered enrolments for nearly 600,000 Australians. She knows that we are removing financial barriers to TAFE as part of our action on the cost of living to get inflation down and wages up and to create new jobs. She knows that this is making a difference. We've heard this through the free TAFE Senate inquiry, through dozens of submissions which have highlighted the positive impact of free TAFE. TAFE Directors Australia shared the story of Bradley Edwards. Bradley is a young father who studied for a cert III in early childhood education and care at TAFE SA. Bradley says this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fee Free TAFE has helped me by allowing me to study and pursue this career without the concern of whether or not I can even afford to study and change careers years after leaving high school …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know, and the member for Paterson knows this very well, that more than one-third of all the enrolments in free TAFE have been in regional and rural areas. That's why the Central Queensland University submission goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Regional students face the extra costs of time, transport, distance, childcare, time away from work and other expenses … In such circumstances, education … often becomes a discretionary expense. Fee-Free TAFE has helped to alleviate this burden, enabling students to pursue their studies without having to choose between education and financial stability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's look at how much students save. A student like Bradley studying a cert II in ECEC in South Australia could save around $4,400. In the NT, a student doing a cert III in community services could save around $8,800—real savings for people, getting skills that they want in areas we need. But, of course, there is more to do to support Australians, and that's why we are making free TAFE permanent. But the Liberals continue to call it wasteful spending. The Leader of the Opposition says he's going to cut 'wasteful spending'. The last time they were in government, the coalition left Australians with the second-worst skills shortage in the OECD. They cut $3 billion from TAFE and training. They failed to land a national skills agreement with the states and territories for nearly a decade. And they haven't changed. Before they all voted against the bill today, the deputy opposition leader said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it's a key principle and tenet of the Liberal Party: if you don't pay for something, you don't value it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it's not just free TAFE they don't value; it's all public education—Medicare, the NDIS and public hospitals. But Australians value all of these, and they know they'll be worse off under the Liberal Party and a government led by this Leader of the Opposition. </span>

After three years, your government has still refused to ban gambling ads, so will you at least accept the Greens' compromise offer to ban gambling ads online that target our kids and during sport when families are watching?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  I thank the member for her question, which goes to a number of matters, including gambling advertising, the issue of time and, as I see it—and as I've seen reported from her colleague Senator Hanson-Young—questions around the interests of the community and the interests of members of parliament. I think it's important to first point out, considering it's so contemporaneous, that Senator Hanson-Young was out there today basically talking about prioritising—this is what she accuses—the interests of the community over the interests of the gambling lobby and those making money off this parasitic and dangerous industry. I find it interesting that the honourable member, who is a member of the Greens political party from Queensland, should ask this when the Queensland Greens have accepted over nearly half a million dollars in donations from a highrolling gambler. This is despite pushing for a ban on political donations from the gambling industry. Even more interesting is that the honourable member is one of three members from Queensland who have benefited from this, and the spokesperson for the Greens is saying, 'Our campaigns are entirely funded by people who believe in our vision and platform.' So, of course, constituents in the seats of Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan should be well aware of where that money is coming from to fund the honourable member's campaign.</span>

In early 2024, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane Times</span> reported that Turpie had donated $472,088 to the party since—</span>

                  </a>  The Greens political party has had so many positions on this issue now—probably three positions in as many days. It's a party that has been vehemently opposed to this government's consultation process. I acknowledge, Mr Speaker, that this is taking longer to get done than we would have liked. The reason for that is the complexity, whereas the Leader of the Opposition, when he was a member of a cabinet for nine years, initiated changes that resulted in a 50 per cent increase in gambling advertising and an even bigger increase in regional areas. We will get this right because we know how important it is.</span>

They've shown that they've got, to be fair, different priorities, which I'll get to momentarily. But we believe direct support for Australian households is an appropriate priority for the government of Australia, and, of course, we know that there's also a lot more to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we know we need more electricity generation. As I said to the House yesterday, it's a good thing that, while in the decade of coalition government four gigawatts of dispatchable energy left our grid, in the three years of the Albanese government four gigawatts of dispatchable energy have entered the grid. That's the contrast of approach. Of course, in addition to that, we've added 15 gigawatts of renewables. That's in addition to the four gigawatts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting thing about the 15 gigawatts of new renewable energy that's been added in the last three years is that that's more than the opposition would add in nuclear power by 2050. We've added more in three years than they would need the next 25 to deliver. The other thing about those gigawatts that we've added over the last three years is that the vast bulk of that investment has come from the private sector. The vast bulk has come from private companies, facilitated by government policy but funded by the private sector, because on this side of the House we—the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I—have the view that, if the private sector can do something, they should do it, not the taxpayer. That's what we think on this side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the House, they have a different view. The member asked me what would make Australians worse off, and what would make Australians worse off is unnecessary taxpayer expenditure. Under the opposition's own policy, they would spend every dollar of their nuclear policy from the taxpayer. When the taxpayer pays for something the private sector could pay for, that means the taxpayer is worse off, and it's got to be paid for by cuts to government expenditure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know they have $350 billion of cuts, and then they've got to pay for the nuclear policy and then they've got to pay for the lunch policy. We also believe that the private sector should pay for bosses' lunches. They're against support for households, but they're for taxpayer funded barramundi for bosses. Those are the priorities made, the decisions made, by the Leader of the Opposition. That's why he is such a risk to the taxpayer and that's why he's such a risk to Australia. He doesn't think through his policies. He is always happy to throw taxpayer money at his mates. He's happy to throw taxpayer money at nuclear energy and taxpayer money at lunch for bosses, when we believe in the private sector. That's why the opposition is so risky for Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  on indulgence—Last evening, it was with deep sadness that I attended the vigil, along with 2,000 to 3,000 others, for Charlize Zmuda on her beloved Woorim Beach on Bribie Island's surf side. Charlize was a teenager who tragically lost her life from a shark attack on Monday. Bribie is renowned as a tight-knit community, and the vigil last night was no greater example of this island community's care for one another. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lives of Charlize's parents, Steve and Renee, and her sister, Stephanie, will never be the same again. But I'm convinced the outpouring of shared grief and love from the Bribie Island community, her St Columban school and Bribie Island Surf Life Saving Club families has eased the unimaginable pain they would be enduring right now just that little bit by the love expressed on that beach last night, which was truly tangible. I thank everyone who came to remember, grieve with and support this beautiful family. The entire Zmuda family are part of the fabric of the Bribie Island Surf Life Saving Club. From Nippers to serving on the board, patrolling or representing the club at carnivals and competitions, this family has, for years, selflessly given so much to the club, protecting the lives of those who visit this piece of paradise in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, just one day after the tragic loss of his daughter, Charlize's father, Steve, was insisting that we all encourage people that they continue to come to Bribie—that it's a place that the Zmuda family have and always will love, despite the loss of their beautiful daughter. What remarkable strength. It is in these times that we rightly try and make sense of why a life such as Charlize's, from such a fine family, could be taken. Sadly, this is a question we can never answer. But to Steve, Renee, Stephanie, the two grandmothers I met last night and all the other family members and friends: in the future there will be many milestones that will be missed in Charlize's life, but I encourage you all, in these times, to focus on all the milestones you did celebrate—milestones like birthdays, that first step, first word, first tooth, first day of school, first Nippers carnival, the lead role in last year's performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">High School Musical</span> and her high school formal, which was just last Friday night. My thoughts and prayers are with the entire family and community as they grieve and endure this most difficult of times. May you rest in peace, Charlize.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Before I start, I note the very heartfelt words from the member for Longman on that very sad event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said this before in this parliament, but I want to reiterate it—it's a very sad statement, but a reality for people living in regional Australia—that this government has given up on and does not show any concern about regional Australia. I can tell you from my patch and a lot of my colleagues over here on this side of the parliament that Nationals seats and regional Liberal seats dominate representing regional Australia. There's a reason for that. It's because regional Australia has given up on the Labor Party and the Greens, teals and Independents as well. Why do I say that? I say that for two major reasons. One is that they demonise us. That side, inner-city elite MPs, demonise regional Australia. I'll give a whole lot of examples of that later. They then, of course, then go over the top of that and ignore us and neglect us. In some cases they even take advantage of regional Australia when it suits them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think, 'Why would you demonise regional Australia?' I remind this chamber—I do it nearly every time I stand up in this place, when I can—that regional Australia is responsible for over $400 billion of exports of goods and services from this country. As a country we exported about $660 billion worth of stuff. Over two-thirds of that come from, guess where? It's from regional Australia. Regional Australia is the economic backbone of this country. You might think that they might say thanks. You might think that the inner-city elite MPs over there and the inner-city elite MPs on the crossbench—the teals and the Greens; I'll excuse the member for Mayo from that—might say thankyou. But, no; all they do is demonise it. One of those exports—and I'll go through a couple in a minute—is food. We obviously generate all the food. The whole farming and agricultural sector is in regional Australia, as are mining, coal, iron ore, gas—all those major exports. None of those are in the cities. None of those are coming out of inner-city Melbourne or Sydney, where a lot of city elite MPs on the other side and on the crossbenches live. That's the unfortunate—or the fortunate—reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through a couple of examples. There's one thing we've seen. The inner-city elite MPs—the Greens, the teals and the Labor Party—sit in their apartment blocks on their leafy, inner-city streets. One of the things these MPs done in this last parliament which has devastated part of regional Australia is say, 'We're going to ban live sheep exports from this country.' That was a shameful decision. It's devastated a lot of communities, especially in Western Australia. But they know best! They watch the ABC. They read the Guardian newspapers, and they know what should happen or shouldn't happen with live exports in this country. They ignore the fact that we have the best animal welfare standards in that industry. They ignore the fact that those communities have done a great job at improving that export industry because they know best. Because of their leftie media and their inner-city elite opinions, they're going to ban that industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said it before, but I can say that, under a Dutton-Littleproud government, that decision will be reversed. That industry can breathe easy knowing that they're generating wealth for this country and jobs for this country. It's also an insult from them, because what they're also saying to our trading partners, the importers of live exports, is: 'That product that you want to export isn't okay.' That's what they're saying. The Leader of the Greens is saying that any country that imports live sheep shouldn't demand that. They shouldn't have that. So it's an insult to a lot of countries in the Middle East and an insult to our partners in Indonesia. These people do this for a lot of different reasons that we shouldn't have judgement on, and we do it in a very humane way with some of the best standards that we could have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Sydney is another inner-city elite MP. What has she done in this parliament? She has taken water from our farmers. She said, 'You're greedy. You shouldn't get as much water as you do.' This water's growing our fibre. This water's growing our food. It is really important to a lot of our communities in the Murray-Darling Basin, but they've said, 'No. You shouldn't have it.' Do you know what they want to happen to that water? They want it to roll out to sea. They have this ideological obsession—again, the Guardian newspaper's on board and the ABC's on board—that the River Murray mouth should never be closed. Why should it never be closed? They say that it's better environmentally. Before we put in a weir and lock system—before you could hold water back—that mouth used to close all the time, because water used to roll out more quickly. But, no, the inner-city elite MP Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, knows better than country people. She knows better than regional people and, again, she has demonised what we do. This basin plan is going to kill towns and communities, which they don't care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch on two other issues, which are more in state jurisdictions, but we obviously have input to them, especially fishing. I don't know if you realise this, but we import over 70 per cent of the fish that we eat in this country. Why do we do that? We do that because fishing is bad as well! We overfish; we do terrible things. So guess what we do? We import fish. We actually have really sustainable practices. Our fishermen know how to do this. They know the areas that you don't fish in when it's breeding season. They know the parts you don't go to, because they want to be able to fish every year. In fact, back in the seventies, the fishermen were telling the department the types of areas they shouldn't go to and when they shouldn't go to them. They were educating them about what to do. But now, no, the bureaucrats in the fisheries department and the inner-city elites say, 'That's terrible.' The ABC and the Guardian tell them that we overfish, so we get our fish now from countries that do sometimes exploit their regions, because we aren't fishing places in Australia that we should. We're surrounded by water, and we can't get enough fish to feed ourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one—I know this has been very important to the member for Gippsland and other members on this side—is hardwood timber. Again, guess what? The ABC doesn't like it; the Guardian doesn't like this; inner-city elite MPs don't like this. We have a great, sustainable hardwood timber industry. There's nothing better and more renewable than when you have trees grow up. If they listened to the forestry industry, they'd know that it's even better for carbon sequestration for a new tree to grow where an old tree was, because it absorbs more carbon, but, again, inner-city elite people know better! You know better, when you're sitting in inner-city Melbourne, what they should be doing with hardwood and where they should be doing that in country and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there's the whole national parks story. I've seen farmland in my region turned into national park. Do you know what happens when you turn that into a national park? It becomes a weed infested debacle and a fire tinderbox filled with weeds and feral animals. We saw that in the bushfires, and also with koalas. Do you know what the first thing koalas do when something is turned into a national park? They leave it because they can't crawl around the ground—there are too many weeds there—and they come onto farmland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy on that side over there and on the crossbenches, when I say they take advantage of regional areas. It's especially prevalent right now, with the reckless renewable policy of those opposite. I told a story once before in this chamber where the member for Warringah had said that six wind turbines and a hectare of solar panels wouldn't be okay in North Head because of the cultural and historical significance of the environment in that region. So North Head can't take six wind turbines and a hectare of solar panels, but, you know what, all those elite city MPs are okay for regional Australia to—guess what?—get 60 million solar panels and about 20,000 wind turbines. And that's okay—there's no cultural environmental significance with that. That's all fine, apparently, for regional Australia to do that. Again, it's sanctimony and hypocrisy from them on that. I can say quite legitimately, that, although they talk about the environment, the environmental damage being done with the new transmission system that is needed for their reckless renewable policy is not okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to run out of time, but I'm going to quickly mention some other things about the neglect of regional areas. One of the first things this government did was get up and talk about Medicare. You can't even get doctors in a lot of regional and country towns. One of the reasons is that they changed the definition of a 'distribution priority area', and that took out doctors from regional Australia to the suburbs. That side is a disgrace to regional Australia, and so are the teals and the Greens.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281988" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  That was a load of outrage, carry-on and misplaced anger. I've heard just a whole bunch of bumph, because the previous National and Liberal state government are the ones who put additional parks in New South Wales. It was the previous coalition state government that put additional parks in New South Wales. Go and check the record. The member for Page has clearly been taking some random instructions. 'Go out and be outraged; we need a grab.' But he's failed to understand that there has actually been more investment in regional Australia over the last 2½ years than in the previous 10. We've been delivering with integrity and transparency, and it'll take me a lot longer than 10 minutes to go through it, but I'm going to give it a crack because I think the member for Page needs to understand that regional Australia is a bit more than a grant program and a bit more than outrage and carry-on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put regional Australia at the centre of our government's plan for a prosperous and resilient future which is made in Australia, because a future made in Australia is a future made in regional Australia. We get it, which is why we're investing $22.7 billion over 10 years to attract investment into Australia, to make us a leader in renewable energy, adding value to our natural resources and strengthening our economic security. As we speak, funding is rolling out for priority community projects under our $600 million Growing Regions Program. We're delivering almost $100 million in funding under our Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program. Round 2 of Growing Regions has just come out. I note that, in the member for Page's electorate, Clarence Valley Council has just got $1.6 million for the Grafton regional aquatic centre waterslide project because at the heart of every regional community is a high-quality swimming pool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're at it, let's talk about how we've engaged with regional communities through local councils. We are progressively doubling Roads to Recovery funding to a billion dollars each and every year. Those of us who drive on regional roads are well aware that they are in desperate need of funding. Each and every council in this country is now delivering more local priority projects thanks to the Albanese government. Councils in the electorate of Page, for example, will receive $66.6 million in Roads to Recovery funding, which is an increase of $27.7 million, a figure that the member who just spoke never achieved even in his nine years in government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I'm at it, those opposite actually froze indexation on financial assistance grants, ripping nearly a billion dollars out of local communities. This has had a dire impact on our communities, which is why the sector has welcomed our record funding increases. The mayor of Temora Shire Council in the member for Riverina's electorate, Mayor Firman, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This funding is a significant contribution to the enhancement and maintenance of our roads and will have a positive impact on our community. The commitment of your ministry to improving our road network is greatly appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are helping more Australians get into homeownership with our Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. Eighteen thousand regional Aussies have benefited so far because we expanded the eligibility criteria to help more people in our regions. We have delivered tax cuts for all and created a million jobs so far. We introduced the same job, same pay laws, which the Leader of the Opposition said would close down Australia and take us back to the Dark Ages, but, in reality, these laws are delivering Australians the pay rises they need and deserve. Regional Aussies are earning more and keeping more of what they earn because of our government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, here are a couple of examples of how same job, same pay works. Workers at a meat-processing facility in regional Queensland have had wage increases of up to 42 per cent, and 90 workers in a New South Wales coalmine operated by Boggabri Coal have had pay increases of between $15,600 and $35,000. We've also increased wages for aged-care workers and early childhood educators. We've expanded paid parental leave to 26 weeks, and we're adding super on top of it. But all this is at risk because the Leader of the Opposition wants to wind back these laws in favour of his big business mates and their long lunches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're at it, we'll talk about regional health care because I know that that was a focus for the member for Page. We're actually focusing on delivering good-quality health care across the country. In fact, just before question time, the Prime Minister and health minister announced an increase of $1.7 billion for our hospitals around the country. I noticed that those opposite, who are great defenders of regional Australia, just had a whinge about regional health care but didn't say, 'Well done on delivering more money for hospitals across our regions.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad I've got your attention now, because it is incredibly important to deliver not only good-quality health care but cheaper medicines for our communities. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro alone, residents have saved $7.6 million because of the Albanese government's cheaper medicines policy—a policy that these people voted against. We have tripled the bulk-billing incentive and, thanks to our landmark investments, have added 2.2 million bulk-billed visits in regional and rural Australia. We've also opened 61 free walk-in Medicare mental health centres across Australia, 22 endometriosis and pelvic pain specialist clinics in every state and territory and 87 Medicare urgent care clinics from Queanbeyan to Broome to Mount Gambier to free up our emergency rooms and get people seen sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the calls from nursing, teaching and social work students who needed help with the cost of living, so we said, 'We'll provide you with mandatory prac payments.' Those payments are available from July this year. We understand that regional development isn't just about investing in roads and infrastructure; it's about investing in people and their skills and training. Regional apprentices will benefit from $10,000 in incentive payments from 1 July this year to top up their wages during the lives of their apprenticeships if they're working in the housing and construction sector. We're raising the allowance paid to apprentices living away from home, the first time the payment has increased since 2003. We have opened more regional uni study hubs because you shouldn't have to pack your bags to build your future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From Tumut in my electorate to Clermont, Hughenden and Moranbah in Queensland, west to Northam and Kununurra in WA, and south to Kangaroo Island, we are investing in young Australians being able to study closer to home. We're making TAFE free permanently because it is a big success. We want to make sure that we provide fairer school funding for every student in every public school across the country, and we are delivering cheaper and universal access to child care, with more than $1 billion invested to improve not just affordability but accessibility for regional kids. Those opposite talk a big game and they talk about childcare deserts, but they did nothing about it in their nine years in government and are voting against it, saying it's a bad policy. Go back to your regional communities and tell them you don't want more childcare places in your communities, then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll go on because the facts speak for themselves. We are delivering an additional $3 billion to complete the NBN because we take connectivity seriously. We need it to run our small businesses, access education services and work from home. Our record investment, which is cleaning up the mess that those opposite left us, is connecting more than 2.1 million premises across the nation, many in our regions. And we want the NBN to stay in public ownership because privatisation means worse service. We've seen that time and time again under those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am nearly out of time, but I need to tell you this. On this side of the House, we invest in making sure our communities are more prepared for and more resilient to disasters, with $750 million already out the door in Disaster Ready funding and $519.1 million in Future Drought Fund programs to help Aussie farmers and regional communities be more resilient. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish by saying that, on this side of the House, we actually believe in investing not only in roads and in infrastructure but in service delivery because regional communities deserve that. And, as an inner-city elite who apparently lives in a smaller town than most of you over there, I will say—</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  I'd like to, first of all, reach out and dedicate this speech to Brian Smith. Brian Smith, who is in the hardboard industry, was speaking to me on the weekend about how his life and the lives of the timber workers have been decimated by the excessive green form of belligerence of the Labor Party and their cohort. That is just one example of what they've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to dedicate this to Alexandra Meggitt, who came to the building yesterday after walking hundreds of kilometres with her dog, Cliff, because of the blight which intermittent power is on regional Australia. It's decimating people's rights, tearing communities apart, putting one person against another and subsidising multibillionaires and overseas companies with capacity investment schemes which are so secret. They talk about how money is wasted here and money is wasted there, yet they funnel money to China, to Singapore and to Europe to underwrite these intermittent-power swindle factories so that they can come out to regional areas. The fruit of their labour is power that poor people in regional areas cannot afford. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our area alone, I remember talking to one person, a lady—there was nothing wrong with her; she had no problems with drugs, no afflictions—who was about to start living in her car because she could not put up with the cost of living. She had no money. And the seed, the source of that, the No.1 issue, was power prices. Yet to assuage the God, to assuage the cults, they go forward and continue their relentless push to push up the price of power so more people in regional areas go into poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you just one program. It was a program for roads in neglect in remote areas that people hadn't seen. We'd get a road that has never been dealt with and put some money there for some gravel and a bit of bitumen. But the first thing the Labor Party did was get rid of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had dams projects. We had Hells Gate Dam. We had Urannah Dam. We had the Bowen pipeline. We had Emu Swamp, Wyangala and Dungowan. What was the first thing they did? They got rid of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Inland Rail, the corridor of commerce that was going to build the inland of Australia and help your carbon emission reduction scheme to basically make this nation stronger. What was the first thing they did when they got here? They got rid of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about health. We have hospitals where if the nurse falls over they've got to be taken to another hospital because there's no doctor in the hospital. In Muswellbrook, a Labor Party seat, they have no obstetrics. If you have a baby in Muswellbrook, you have to go to Newcastle, because you cannot have a baby in Muswellbrook. This is what is happening under the Labor Party, the apparent party for all. What an absolute joke that is!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen water buybacks. They've come into regional areas. Yes, I'll be quite frank: if you buy the water off a farmer, it's not a problem; I'll buy myself a flat on the Gold Coast—I don't know—and get out of the joint. But what about the hairdresser? What about the tyre business? What about the people who are left behind? What are you going to do for them? They just get left in a new form of economic destitution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what you have done to regional towns. You have been blind. Regional areas have the poorest people in Australia because they don't have the services. The member for Eden-Monaro said, 'I've lived in a town smaller than yours.' I don't think you've lived in a town smaller than Danglemah, because I don't think it's possible. My neighbour is not on the grid. There's no power. My neighbours are part Aboriginal. That's where I live. I actually live in these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policies that you support are pushing these people further and further into poverty, yet you sit there with this sort of smarmy thing. There's no better example than the member for McMahon. Every time the member for McMahon gets to that dispatch box, guess what happens for us? Our vote goes up. So I'll tell you what—if you truly want to understand regional Australia, how about you actually get one of your cabinet meetings and actually come out to regional Australia? Bring that fellow with you. Gosh, we want to meet him out there!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  Most of you know of my son, Charlie. I like to share his little anecdotes. When a photo of Parliament House comes up on the TV or he sees it in a book, Charlie often refers to it as Canberra kinder. 'Hey, Mummy, that's Canberra kinder.' For Charlie, that was true. He did go to the childcare centre here for many years, so he has that connection to the building. It was his Canberra kinder. But at some points I have moments in this chamber where I feel like it's more than just the childcare centre. With the behaviour that we have had, particularly, unfortunately, from some of the National Party representatives, it does feel like we're in a kinder. The babble from the Nationals in this debate has hit a new level of silliness, when this is a really important issue: how we support, invest in and help our regional communities to expand and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can use this area of ECEC as a moment to segue, when we came into government the deserts in early childhood education in the regions were profound. We had people who couldn't move to regional communities to be the nurses, to be the teachers, to work in mining or to establish their lives in a regional centre, because they had no access to early childhood education. It didn't exist. We had farming communities and farming families frustrated that they had no access to early childhood education. It's taken the election of a Labor government and the record investment that we have made in early childhood education to turn this around. Not just have we invested in building more childcare centres, with new announcements about more bricks and mortar; we've been making child care cheaper by reforming how the subsidy works and investing in the workforce. That is critical to getting people to move to and stay in the regions, because they can earn a decent income—something that the other side don't want to talk about. And then there is the reform that we announced today, which is the scrapping of the activity test. In regional communities, there is a less rigid work structure, so the activity test was knocking people out of accessing quality care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People on my side have talked about the NBN. The NBN didn't get completed in the regions by those opposite; it took our government to invest in the rollout of fibre-to-the-kerb everywhere and finish the job. The NBN is critical to ending the digital divide between the regions and the cities. In my electorate alone, it will improve people's lives. We are getting the access and speeds that we need for businesses, home businesses, families and schools. I now rarely get complaints from families that can't connect all at once to do their assignments, do the books for the business and get things done. That's because they're getting the speeds that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been tax cuts for every worker. Under our government, every single worker—not just those on the top incomes working in the city but every worker—got a tax cut: retail workers, aged-care workers, health workers, people living in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is fairer funding for all our schools. I really want to emphasise this. It was the previous government that changed the funding arrangements, which saw our public schools get less. It disproportionately impacted regional communities and smaller schools—fewer students meant less funding. That was under their watch. We have changed that through new funding agreements with all states but New South Wales and Queensland. As a Victorian, I welcome this. I have so many small schools in my electorate—public schools delivering good-quality education but falling behind simply because they don't get the same money. This will change lives and give every student, regardless of their postcode, a decent education. Yet, rather than joining us on a unity ticket around school funding, those opposite give us babble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk about health care and how we've had an increase in bulk-billing rates. The top two electorates? Mayo, in regional South Australia, and Bendigo, in regional Victoria. We've restored confidence in the grants system and turned it around. There are the changes on water. I wish we could have an MPI on water, so I could talk about the inefficiencies in our water system, including in my electorate. We are a government that cares about the regions; we're a government delivering for the regions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I furiously agree with the member for Bendigo: we do need more help, support and investment in regional Australia. In Bendigo, Andrew Lethlean, the Nationals candidate, will certainly provide that. Just the other day, he had his launch. There were 300 people there. There's a movement there, because they want a member who's going to invest, support and help Bendigo and the wider region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fascinated to hear the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, the member for Eden-Monaro no less, mention Councillor Rick Firman, the Mayor of Temora, and his praise for roads funding. Yes, he does want more roads funding. Which local government area wouldn't? But, you know, just last Friday, whilst he was driving to a mayors' forum, the previously mentioned Councillor Firman phoned me. He was in fact disappointed, would you believe, at the fact that Temora shire had missed out on Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program round 1 funding. But that's not the rub. They'd received the email at 4.29 pm the previous day and were told in the same email that, whilst they'd missed out on tranche 1 funding, round 2 hadn't closed. When do you think round 2 closed? One minute to midnight that day. So they had a day and a bit to get in their application and supporting submission for round 2. No country council has people who can just be pulled out of whatever else they're doing to provide that detail and information. Local councils around Australia have been left disappointed, left wanting, by this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Eden-Monaro talked about health. Yes, we respect the fact that Labor have made a health announcement today. But the very first thing that they did when they got into government was change the distribution priority area arrangements with country areas, so general practitioners in country areas took down their shingle and moved to the suburbs. They left those regional and remote areas that were so desperate and crying out for doctors. That is what they did. Thankfully, we put in place the rural medical school network through the Murray-Darling Basin, which will provide doctors in the long term, but in the short term, because of those changes to the DPA arrangements, we have lost doctors. Don't just take my word for it. Listen to the Rural Doctors Association. They absolutely castigated the Labor government for that measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about bulk billing, they go and praise Medicare, but bulk-billing rates have dropped 11 per cent, and they have dropped even more in regional areas. What did the health minister say when he was questioned? He said, 'If you can't get a bulk-billing doctor, ring up another one. If you can't find a bulk-billing doctor, then go and ring the next doctor and make an appointment with him or her.' That might all be good in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide, but it doesn't cut through in regional Australia, because, when you're in pain, ill, sick and need to see a doctor, often you can't find one who bulk-bills—or one who doesn't bulk bill. You can't find one at all, and you have to wait weeks and weeks and weeks. You shouldn't have to catch a plane when you're in pain. That's, unfortunately, what regional people are facing thanks to this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a long list of failures by this Labor government. There's this lack of respect for regional Australia. It's regional Australia that led this country through COVID, and they continue to grow the food, fibre and provide the exports for our resources for our balance of payments. What did the city types opposite do? They hid under their bedsheets, pulled the doona up over them and pretended that nothing was happening. It happened because regional Australia led this nation, and regional Australia will continue to lead this nation with or without the respect or funding from those opposite. But, I tell you what, when we get back into government, we will provide that respect. We will provide that funding. We will provide that support, help and investment that regional Australia so desperately craves. Look at the lack of respect with the live sheep exports. When the member for Page was on his feet, the Attorney-General turned and said, 'What's he even talking about?' It's live sheep exports. It's that valuable industry which has been going on for decades out of Western Australia, and you blokes just chopped it. How disgraceful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not all. We're upgrading Barwon Heads Road in the fast-growing suburb of Armstrong Creek. We're upgrading dangerous intersections like Grubb Road in Ocean Grove, Reserve Road in Grovedale and Murradoc Road in St Leonards. Then there's the South Geelong to Waurn Ponds rail line, which includes $784 million of federal government investment. There's the Midlands Highway in Bannockburn. Then there are road upgrades across the Surf Coast, the Otways and across regional Victoria. We've upgraded school technology in schools like Surf Coast Secondary College and Drysdale Primary School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're strengthening Medicare for regional Australians, rolling out Medicare urgent care clinics across our country, including one right in the heart of my region. And, of course, bulk-billing rates are on the up, enabling more people to see a GP without it impacting their bank balance. Medicare billing data shows that the Albanese government is working to strengthen Medicare. We've revived bulk billing with Australians in regional Australia, having had an additional 586,000 free visits to a GP in the past year. That's a fact. No matter how those opposite try to spin it, the data speaks for itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that free TAFE is changing the lives of so many people across my region and Australia. Australians across the nation are embracing this opportunity and embarking on a new journey as builders, electricians and support workers in the aged-care and care sector. More than 500,000 Australians have jumped at this opportunity to get the skills they want and to fill the jobs our nation needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know all of this is at risk under the coalition. I can't imagine how devastated my communities would feel to have fee-free TAFE scrapped or to have their Medicare urgent care clinic closed. It would be heartbreaking. The coalition need to make clear what their plans are for these crucial services and opportunities that improve the lives of regional Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For women and families, we also know paid parental leave is at risk. Our government is expanding the program to 26 weeks for new parents, with super payments included. It's a policy that is truly life changing, and it's a clear example of how our Labor government is prepared to support families. We understand that family is the foundation of a prosperous and optimistic nation, and the most critical time for a family is when a child is born. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also about to have groundbreaking, new educational agreements to properly fund public schools. This matters in the regions. Under the coalition, this is all at risk. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opposition that favours long lunches over support for families. They want to slash workers' wages and rip apart the Public Service—a Public Service that is reducing waiting times for so many of the supports Australians rely on. These services matter to people. They improve lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government are committed to building on our work and empowering regional Australia. We're committed to forging a future that opens the door to opportunities for families across the Bellarine and Surf Coast, across wider Geelong and across the regions of the nation. It's a future where workers are supported, infrastructure is actually delivered and our manufacturing industries are revitalised.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  Capricornians are doing it tough. Three years ago the Prime Minister promised Australians they would be better off under his leadership, but that could not be further from the truth. Under Labor's economic mismanagement, regional Australia has been plundered to keep this government afloat. Nowhere is this more evident than in my electorate of Capricornia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not since the 1980s have Australians endured sustained inflation for this long, all due to Labor's reckless handling of the economy. Families are struggling just to put food on the table and keep up with mortgage repayments. They even have to make the impossible choice about whether to turn on the air conditioning this summer as power prices soar. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are barely staying afloat. It is a fact that, under a Labor government, doing business in Australia is harder. Capricornia's manufacturers are being strangled by legislation. One such business, SMW, has told me firsthand how Labor policies are drowning them in red tape, making it nearly impossible to stay viable. Rising electricity costs, skyrocketing fuel prices and excessive regulation are forcing hardworking Australian businesses to the brink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is robbing Peter to pay Paul and slashing critical regional infrastructure funding that has delivered enormous economic benefits. Programs like the Building Better Regions Fund created jobs, built much-needed infrastructure and supported local communities. But this government sees no value in regional Australia. Instead, Labor is stripping the regions of investment, to bankroll pet projects in the capital cities. This is despite the fact that it is the people in the regions—the farmers, the miners, the manufacturers and the small-business owners—who generate the wealth that our nation relies on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since day one I have fought to protect my constituents from a Labor government that sees the regions as little more than a cash cow for its wasteful spending. Take the Bruce Highway, a lifeline for our communities. In Labor's first year in government, funding for this critical road was slashed. The $10 billion in projects inherited from the coalition were put under the knife, with $488 million cut from the forward estimates. While in government, the coalition invested over $415 million into the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Mackay to make it safer. Projects like providing more overtaking lanes, providing more rest areas and widening centre strips save lives, but, under Labor, additional crucial upgrades were put on hold, leaving the road more dangerous than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences have been devastating. Last year, over 40 lives were lost on the Bruce Highway. A report from the RACQ identified the stretch between Rockhampton and Mackay as one of deadliest in Queensland. While families grieved and communities mourned, Labor stayed silent. I have sat with families who lost loved ones. I have listened to the heartbreak. Leyland Barnett, who lost his niece, bravely shared his family's pain with the media, but even this was not enough to spur Labor into action. Week after week lives were lost, but the government did nothing. But suddenly, in an election year, the Prime Minister miraculously found $7.2 billion for the Bruce Highway. This was not a genuine commitment to road safety; it was a desperate election stunt. History is repeating itself. Labor has never taken regional road safety seriously. If not for the tireless efforts of locals, the Rockhampton ring road would have been axed in Labor's first budget. If not for my fight to protect regional projects, vital upgrades to Phillips Creek Bridge, a notoriously dangerous crossing in a resource-rich part of Capricornia, would have been lost to Labor's infrastructure review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's neglect extends beyond roads. Community groups that rely on government support to improve local facilities are being left in limbo. The Sarina Brewers Park upgrade committee has been waiting endlessly for a response to its application for a feasibility study just to improve sporting grounds that have produced some of Australia's best athletes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does not care about regional Australia. It does not care about the people who work hard to build this country's prosperity. Labor has failed regional Australians. Only a coalition government will get Australia back on track. Easing cost-of-living pressures is a priority. Strengthening the economy, backing small businesses and ensuring affordable and reliable energy will provide stability for families and businesses alike. Addressing the housing crisis, rebalancing the migration program and keeping Australians safe are essential commitments. Quality health care, a stronger regional Australia, practical action for Indigenous Australians and sustainable community development remain at the forefront. Cutting government waste will ensure resources are directed where they are most needed. This is our promise to the people of Capricornia, this is our promise to regional Australia and this is our commitment to getting our country back on track.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I am proud to live in regional Australia. I grew up on a dairy farm. I went to a small public school and my local high school. It's where my tradie husband and I have raised our four kids, who still live locally. I get regional Australia and, as a mum, I have always wanted to give back and help people in the area I love. That's why I am here in this place. So let's talk about some of the things that are hugely important to people in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing is roads. There's a reason that the Nowra bypass is finally moving forward—because we're funding it. I picked this project up when no Liberal member ever did and made sure it got funding. I'm pleased to say that, through our efforts, the project has $97 million in funding from the Albanese Labor government. Once the initial planning phase concludes in 2026, the Nowra bypass project is expected to move into its development phase. The Jervis Bay flyover is under construction thanks to $100 million in funding from the Albanese Labor government—and what a huge difference this intersection is going to make when it is complete. The Princes Highway upgrade from Jervis Bay Road to Hawken Road is also progressing well, with a contract awarded for the next phase. The Milton-Ulladulla bypass has recently moved into that next phase, with a contract awarded for the development of the concept, design and environmental assessment. It is a project with $752 million in federal funding. We not long ago opened the $35 million far north Collector road, for which I sought additional funding so it could be finished and opened. Local councils will see more money to help fix local roads because of our decision to progressively double Roads to Recovery funding over the next five years. Black spot road funding is increasing too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had so many natural disasters in our region. Over 38 landslips and pummelled roads and over 150 local roads have all been fixed with federal and state funding under disaster recovery funding arrangements. I made sure that in the October 2022 budget Shoalhaven City Council had an extra $40 million to fix more local roads. While there have been some delays due to those natural disasters, I am pleased that Shoalhaven council have been progressing this with their appointment of the project consultant who is scooping up those works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With health, I am pleased to say that over 11,000 people have now benefited from our fully bulk-billed Batemans Bay Medicare urgent care clinic. I also have a petition going to expand the hours and the level of care at the Batemans Bay urgent care clinic, and I encourage people to sign the petition. In fact, the urgent care clinic has been so successful that I've launched a new petition to establish a second federally funded urgent care clinic on the New South Wales South Coast. Bring it on! I've already opened a Medicare mental health hub at Nowra and one at Moruya. I've opened a headspace at Kiama. I've opened the south-eastern endometriosis and pelvic pain clinic at Milton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much going on in the health space to support locals and ease cost-of-living pressures where we can, like our cheaper medicines. We've tripled GP bulk-billing incentives for pensioners, concession cardholders and students. Just today we announce an additional $1.7 billion for public hospitals to strengthen Medicare and fund hospitals and health services to cut waiting lists, bring down waiting times and tackle ramping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've provided energy bill relief for every household, and we've provided fee-free TAFE for skills shortage industries like trades, because we know we need tradies to build more homes, which we're doing under our ambitious housing agenda. There are $10,000 apprenticeship incentives to encourage more apprentices into the residential housing sector. There are tax cuts for every taxpayer. Wages are up and, if we're re-elected, we'll slash 20 per cent off student debt, helping 13,000 university students in Gilmore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Liberals just oppose all that. There's one consistent thing about the Liberals: they're all negative. They've opposed every cost-of-living relief measure we've implemented and, as a mum, I just find that offensive. The Liberals will say and do anything to try and get elected, but the truth is that does nothing to help people in my electorate and regional Australia. We're getting on with providing sensible cost-of-living relief where we can and building a future in regional Australia that we can all be proud of.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  The subject of this MPI is that regional Australia has given up on Labor because Labor has given up on them. Labor has never really been that popular in the regions, and, historically, I think we can understand why. The regions are a place that, traditionally, entrepreneurial people have moved to, and entrepreneurial people are more attracted to the coalition's side because we support business, we support small business and, of course, in the Country Party, now the National Party, which I'm very proud to be a member of, we support the businesses that operate in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I noticed before I came into parliament that previous Labor governments and Labor oppositions at least had people who showed some interest in regional Australia, and I say that in deference to the late Simon Crean and also to Joel Fitzgibbon in previous governments and oppositions. But this Albanese Labor government is just not interested in regional Australia. I'll also give a shout-out to the current Leader of the House. When he was the shadow water minister, he was relatively—and I say 'relatively', because we didn't entirely get what we wanted. But he had some understanding when negotiating the Murray-Darling Basin Plan with our then water minister David Littleproud and the member for New England.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happened when the new government came in? The agreement that had happened for the Murray-Darling Basin got completely smashed. I can say with great certainty that my region has given up on the Albanese Labor government because of what they've done in relation to their new Murray-Darling Basin plan. In fact, they don't even call it the Murray-Darling Basin plan anymore. They call it the Plibersek plan, after the minister for water. It's reneged on the agreements that had happened with the states. It's reneged on agreements that were going to put a socioeconomic impact test in place before ripping out 450 gigalitres of extra water. All of this is important because it drives the industries that employ the people in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can get up and talk about fee-free TAFE and you can say, 'We built this and we funded this and we did that.' That's all nice. What regional people want is to be able to do the jobs that they love doing: farming and food processing. If you take the tools away from them—like irrigation water—they can't do that anymore, and no amount of money that someone throws at them for some silo art or God knows what else is going to satisfy those people, because they don't just do it for money; they do it because they love it and because they want to provide food and fibre to people who live in other parts of Australia and other parts of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke earlier today about energy policy, the Integrated System Plan, and I described it as having more holes in it than the colander in my kitchen. Energy policy is a mess. There is no serious analysis of how we're going to firm 82 per cent renewables, and that's important. As I mentioned before, I was on Sky News doing an interview. The member for Warringah was before me and said: 'Baseload power is an antiquated idea. It doesn't matter anymore.' They crossed to me and said, 'What do you think, Sam?' I said: 'I'm standing in an apple orchard. How are we going to refrigerate these apples without baseload power? They don't stop needing refrigeration when the wind's not blowing or the sun's not shining.' This discussion about firming is really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only that. It's what the renewables are doing to people in regional Australia. I've got a beautiful, small—and it's small, so you don't care, because there aren't that many people there—region called Colbinabbin. There are 650 hectares of solar panels on prime agricultural land in the middle of one of the great wine-growing areas of Australia. I spoke to a young couple from Timmering who are off the grid. They're doing more for climate change than a lot of people living in the concrete jungles of Australia. They're off the grid. They're growing vegetables. They're growing sustainable meat. They said to me: 'Sam, Member for Nicholls, I'm trying to do everything right for the environment. Why do I have to have wind turbines the height of the Rialto'—go and have a look at the CBD of Melbourne—'and many of them two kilometres away from where I'm trying to sustainably produce sheep and vegetables?' Please get interested in regional Australia. It's worth it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  They say you shouldn't throw stones in glass houses. Clearly no-one has told this to those opposite, who say this government is giving up on regional Australia. You've got to be joking, Deputy Speaker. It would be funny if it weren't for the fact that those opposite really did leave regional Australia behind in their decade of waste and neglect. They left regional Australia behind so badly that it's shocking that they get up here and say that we have given up on regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has rebuilt regional Australia. I see this every day when I'm driving around my electorate. When I talk to the people of the Hunter, I hear that they are relieved that this government, once again, has their back. We are a government that, once again, values the regions, a government that understands that regional Australia is the vital backbone of our economy. It is where our food is grown. It is where our products are made. It is where our energy is generated. People from the regions are hardworking, good people, and for too long they were let down by those opposite, who had nothing to offer them. We have been rebuilding regional Australia. We have been getting it done with zero thanks to those opposite. We have really put what has been needed back into the regions. We have delivered more for regional Australia than any other government in living memory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a look at my regional electorate. It tells you what this government has done for the regions, particularly in the Hunter. This government has put in over $268 million for the Muswellbrook Bypass project. Over 26,000 freight and passenger vehicles will use this new route every day when it is completed—3,700 heavy vehicles will use it. People have been talking about this bypass since 1996, and we are getting it done with zero thanks to those opposite. Do you think $268 million sounds good? Wait until I tell you about the Singleton Bypass, Deputy Speaker. We have backed this project with $560 million, the largest road infrastructure investment ever in Singleton's history. Five sets of annoying traffic lights will be bypassed by this beautiful eight kilometres of road that is getting built right now in the Hunter. We're getting it done with zero thanks to those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're rebuilding the infrastructure of the regions, with over $25 million in funding for roads and bridges across the Hunter. There is $10 million for a permanent dredge in Lake Macquarie. Almost every town in the Hunter has had NBN connection upgrades because of the wasted money that those opposite put into NBN. We are getting it done, with zero thanks to those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost every school in my electorate has had upgrades under this government, including huge upgrades such as the $1.2 million for Cessnock East Public School and the $4 million for Wakefield Public School. Under this government there is nowhere better to grow up than in regional Australia. There was 500 grand for the Cessnock BMX track and $1 million for the Cessnock Regional Skatepark. Not only are we getting it done, but we're making the regions fun again—with zero thanks to those opposite. When flooding hit our region this government stepped in with $47 million of funding for flood victims through the Back Home funding program. Those opposite said today that we've given up on the regions. Does this sound like we've given up on the regions? Those opposite have got to be having a laugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every taxpayer in the Hunter has benefited from our tax cuts. Over 6,500 families in the Hunter benefit from cheaper child care that this government introduced. Over $7.7 million has been saved by Hunter residents, thanks to cheaper medicines. Same job, same pay has been an absolute life changer for workers in the Hunter, ending the exploitation of unfair work arrangements that blossomed under those opposite. All types of people in the regions are benefiting in all types of ways thanks to this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise to anyone, other than those opposite, that Australians know that our government is truly a government for all Australians. We didn't pit regional Australians against city Australians or any other Australians for that matter. We don't play dress-ups and pretend to be farmers like the Nats do or rock up to the pub in a town, have a couple of beers and then never return like the Libs do. We are a government that genuinely governs for all Australians. We have revived the regions so the future is bright, and the people in the regions know that. This Labor government has their back. </span>

                    </a>  by leave—This review is one of the key functions of the Intelligence and Security Joint Committee as set out by section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, and it's undertaken on an annual basis. The committee is empowered to review the administration and expenditure of six of the 10 agencies that form Australia's national intelligence community—namely, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, Australia's leading domestic intelligence agency; the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, Australia's foreign intelligence agency; the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, AGO, responsible for the collection, analysis and distribution of geospatial intelligence; the Defence Intelligence Organisation, DIO, which brings together all of Defence's intelligence capabilities for Defence decision-making; the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD, who provide intelligence support in relation to signals, communication, cyberwarfare and information security; and the Office of National Intelligence, ONI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conducting its administration and expenditure reviews the committee examines a large volume of classified evidence. For that reason, much of the detail of the review is not able to be publicly reported. The committee's report to parliament and my comments to the House today provide an unclassified, general overview of the committee's key findings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having reviewed the administration of the six agencies for the 2022-23 financial year, the committee is satisfied that they are administering their outcomes and outputs effectively. In reviewing the expenditure of the agencies, the committee is similarly satisfied with their financial integrity, their efforts to achieve value for money for the Australian taxpayer and their management of budget and expenditure over the reported period. The committee notes that the 2022-23 financial year continued a trajectory of growth and change for several agencies, with the ongoing implementation of significant initiatives that commenced during the term of the previous coalition government, including ASD's REDSPICE program and the development of the National Security Office Precinct. The committee is monitoring these major projects, including by receiving regular briefings from relevant agencies on their progress and administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this review, the committee identified some specific focus areas for discussion with the agencies, including artificial intelligence, AI; machine learning, ML; biointelligence; the agencies' efforts to attract and retain culturally and linguistically diverse staff with native-language proficiency; and the agencies use of external contractors. Much has been said in recent media reports about diversity picks and the like, and that's an issue that has been the subject of discussion, particularly in the United States. But for our intelligence agencies it is incredibly important that we do look at culturally and linguistically diverse personnel because it is those personnel who are able to give our intelligence agencies insights that other Australians may not otherwise have, particularly in relation to culture and language. Another area that we looked at specifically was the agencies' use of external contractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was satisfied overall with the evidence it received on these areas of focus, while identifying some matters on which improvement could be made. The committee welcomed the agencies' engagement with the issue of attracting and retaining diverse staff with native-language proficiency. The information provided by the intelligence agencies in relation to their engagement with AI and machine learning was detailed and useful. The committee was pleased to see agencies thinking and planning carefully to ensure the appropriate and effective use of these complex technological tools. Regarding the use of contractors by intelligence agencies, the committee did not identify significant concerns and noted efforts by some to review and rationalise their use of external consultants. The committee encourages agencies to continue their endeavours and their transparency in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of administration and expenditure remains an invaluable function of the committee, helping provide the Australian public with confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of Australia's intelligence agencies. These reviews form one key part of the comprehensive oversight of the intelligence community undertaken by the PJCIS and other bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee extends its appreciation to the six reviewed agencies for their engagement in the process and their candour in the classified hearings of the committee. In addition, the committee thanks the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Australian National Audit Office for their contribution of useful evidence for the committee's considerations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again I also pay tribute to the men and women of the National Intelligence Community, of the Australian Defence Force and of law enforcement agencies. Their hard work, service and courage ensure that Australians remain safe from a vast array of threats which we hope we never have to encounter. Thank you for what you do. With that, I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—In this report, the committee has considered 15 new bills and 284 legislative instruments. It has commented on two bills and three legislative instruments included in its examination of three bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report, the committee commented on the Quality of Care Amendment (Restrictive Practices) Principles 2024. This instrument extends the operation of arrangements for substitute decision-makers to consent to the use of restrictive practices on persons in aged care by a further two years. The committee has previously concluded that the use of restrictive practices on persons in aged care raises significant human rights issues, particularly on the rights of persons with disability. The committee reiterates these concerns and notes that among other matters there is no requirement in the instrument to provide for supported rather than substituted decision-making. Much depends on unknown safeguards and state and territory legislation. As such, the committee has made a few recommendations to amend the quality-of-care principles and to inform future consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also considered a response from the minister regarding the Migration Amendment Bill 2024 and related instruments. The bill, now act, provides for the cessation of certain bridging visas where a third country has given a noncitizen permission to enter and remain in that foreign country. It also expands circumstances in which the minister may determine that a protection finding would no longer be made in relation to a person. It provides for the disclosure of criminal history information, including to foreign countries, and it amends the requirements relating to the imposition of visa conditions on certain bridging visas. These measures limit multiple human rights, including the rights to liberty, freedom of movement, non-refoulement obligations, privacy and effective remedy. The committee considers that the measures do not appear to be compatible with multiple rights and considers the compatibility of measures may be assisted with the act amended, but as the bill has now passed it makes no further comment. It also considers that it remains unclear that legislative instruments providing for the imposition of visa conditions, including ankle monitoring and curfews, are directed towards a pressing and substantial issue or accompanied by sufficient safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also considered a response from the minister regarding the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024, which seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to introduce gift caps and electoral expenditure caps, reduce the donations disclosure threshold and increase public funding to incumbent parties and candidates. The committee recognises that there are a number of important measures in this bill to enable further transparency around democracy; however, there were still questions around whether or not this would disproportionately impact certain candidates and whether or not this would indirectly disadvantage particular groups of people standing for election. As such, the committee has drawn some human rights concerns to the attention of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has also considered a response from the minister regarding the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Communications) Bill 2024 and has made a recommendation to amend the bill to assist its human rights compatibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all members to consider the report closely. It is the first scrutiny report of 2025. It is a long one. A lot of work has gone into it from the secretariat. I thank the deputy chair and all of the committee members. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I rise to speak about the Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2025. I do not agree with the amendment that was moved by the member for Brisbane, and I support the amendment that was moved by the member for Farrer. This entire legislation is essentially an omnibus of health measures following legislative changes in the course of this parliament. The provisions relate to the effective administration of health benefit schemes—in particular, the power to detect, respond to, investigate, disclose and deter misconduct, fraud and noncompliance. It is intended that this bill will amend a number of acts, including the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Act, the Human Services (Medicare) Act, the Dental Benefits Act, the Therapeutic Goods Act and the Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In view of the title of this legislation and the fact that the Minister for Health and Aged Care today in question time referred to the fact that Medicare has recently turned 41, I think it is entirely appropriate that we look at how Medicare is performing, and I want to draw attention to some of the issues that I am confronting and my electorate of Hughes is confronting within southern Sydney and south-west Sydney. First of all, we hear over and over again from those in government, particularly the health minister, that bulk-billing rates have improved and that there are more GPs now than there were under the former government. It did not take me very long to do a tiny little bit of research to understand that that is certainly not the case in most parts of the country and not the case in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only four practices in my electorate now bulk-bill in their entirety. Sixteen per cent of general practices in Hughes bulk-bill in some instances, usually for children 16 years and under and for those with a health services card. But, most tellingly, during the lifetime of this Albanese Labor government more than 20 general practices in my electorate have changed the way that they bill. Over two years and nine months, most of the GPs in my electorate have found that they can no longer bulk-bill. I found that, overall, bulk-billing services have plummeted by 11 per cent since the Albanese Labor government came to office. That is 2.4 million fewer GP services being provided to Australians. Out-of-pocket costs overall have risen by 5.5 per cent during the term of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when those in government, particularly the minister for health, stand there and say that we have more GPs than ever, that health services have increased and that the cost of health has decreased—we hear about cheaper health care—that is simply not true. It is disingenuous for the Albanese Labor government and a very senior minister to be floating that particular line. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently published data—this was at the end of last year, so it is very current—showing the Medicare bulk-billing of GP attendances by month. What that has shown in my electorate particularly is that the rates have declined from about 80 per cent in 2022 to 68 per cent. Again, this is more evidence, not from our side but from other organisations, to say that Medicare bulk-billing under this government has failed. The Australian Medical Association announced just this week that it is putting forward a $4.5 billion plan to modernise Medicare and lift bulk-billing. So not even the Australian Medical Association supports the government's—and, particularly, the health minister's—proposition that it has provided cheaper health care and that Medicare is a success under it. I would certainly consider that if the government intends to continue with the line that Medicare is safe in its hands and that it has boosted our public health system. Again, that is simply, completely disingenuous. We've now got three reports from three different organisations that support that position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can turn now to another couple of issues that the government, those on that side, have championed and called their own, we'll start first of all with endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics. Endometriosis is a debilitating chronic condition that can be very hard to diagnose. Often, those suffering wait an average of seven years before diagnosis. It can lead to infertility in women, and it is extremely, extremely painful. It is pleasing to see that the government and the health minister have opened some endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics across the country. However, this was done on the back of the initial inquiry that commenced under the former coalition government and came about as recommendations from that report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the minister on this issue. I notice that the assistant minister is here in the chamber; I have also met with her, and I thank the assistant minister for her time on this issue. For women in my electorate of Hughes to access one of those clinics, it is at least an hour and a half's drive. I'm in southern Sydney, in the Sutherland Shire, and our nearest clinic, which the health minister very helpfully directed me to, is the Women's Health Centre in the Southern Highlands. That's in Mittagong. From Sutherland, it would take close to two hours to drive there, and the minister thought that that was acceptable for the women in my electorate. It's simply not acceptable. When I look through the list of where those clinics have been located, it appears that this has been Labor very carefully, very strategically choosing to locate those clinics in areas that are either very marginal or that supported Labor coming into power in 2022. There has been no help here for the women in my electorate, for women of southern Sydney and for women of south-western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, while we're on the issue of female health, last week I was doing a mobile office, and a lady called Jodie Treuil came to me. She said that I could mention her in parliament. She said, 'If there is one thing that I could ask you to do, Jenny, it is to look at female health particularly.' I said, 'Yes, I've got a particular interest in it.' She raised a couple of things. She said first of all that, only a couple of months ago, one of her very close friends took her own life as a result of depression caused by symptoms of menopause. She said, 'We are not doing enough for menopause.' I said, 'There has been a Senate inquiry into menopause, and so far the health minister has not acted on all of those recommendations that were made.' Again, that is saying to me that this health minister and this Albanese Labor government do not care about women's health. Jodie also said to me, 'Jenny, why is it that hormone replacement therapy is generally not covered on the PBS and yet Viagra is?' She said, 'I don't want to take Viagra off the PBS, but I want women's hormone replacement therapy put on there.' She said maybe it could have saved her girlfriend's life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is also a very serious issue, and, again, although there are some menopause clinics that have been established throughout Sydney and throughout the country, there are none available in my electorate. My electorate stretches across Sutherland Hospital, Liverpool Hospital and Campbelltown Hospital in the south-west of Sydney, which is one of the areas growing fastest in population. There are no menopause clinics available to women in my electorate. Again, I see this as a massive failure by the Albanese Labor government, a massive failure for women, showing that the noise that the government make about caring about women's health is simply not borne out by their actions. They do not seem to want to put any money into women's health in my electorate or in southern Sydney overall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now talk to one other issue that I have been battling the health minister about. I have a practice in my electorate at Holsworthy. It's called Wattle Grove Family Medical Practice. It has over 3,000 patients on its books. There are currently three GPs only. Many of the patients are veterans' families because of the location at Holsworthy. Dr John Stanford, who runs that practice, has been trying now for close to a year to get another GP registrar into that practice. He said that the failure to have that other registrar is providing much longer wait times for patients, and he's also concerned about the mental health of his other GPs because of their workload with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to Minister Butler. He doesn't reply; his chief of staff does—'a matter for the minister'. I wrote to Minister Butler on this. He kicked the can down the road and said, 'Oh, it's not me; it's the RACGP.' I went to them. I met with the president, who is in my electorate, and she said: 'No, no, no. This is firmly in the hands of the minister.' After 12 months I am still unable to get any assistance from the minister to help the men, women and children of Holsworthy and of my electorate with an extra GP registrar. Again I say that this shows that this minister and this Labor government do not care about the health of my electorate. They do not care about the health of women, men and children in southern and south-western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I have to sit here in question time or at other times and hear the Minister for Health and Aged Care talking about great announcements and how they've produced cheaper Medicare and more bulk billing, that is simply not borne out by the evidence. When I have to hear him saying that Labor is the party for women, that is simply not borne out by the evidence that I have seen in my electorate. I would like the health minister to answer this: why is it that he does not care about the health of women, the health of men and the health of children in my electorate of Hughes?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2025 proposes amendments to improve enforcement of several integrity measures for Medicare, some minor amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and amendments related to the government's tobacco and vaping reforms. I'd like to speak to the changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which the government hopes will enhance its capacity to manage and alleviate the consequences of therapeutic goods shortages in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medication shortages have been a significant and ongoing issue in this country for a number of years. I have drawn attention to this issue in question time on several occasions and in questions on notice to the minister. The fact is that we lack appropriate mechanisms in this country for anticipating or dealing appropriately with medication shortages. Today, the TGA lists 416 medication shortages and 67 anticipated shortages on its website. It receives an average of 120 notifications of new medical shortages every month, at least 10 per cent of which are critical. Last year, we had a national shortage of intravenous fluids for months. This was a shortage which the health minister himself admitted he did not see coming. It was a shortage which necessitated postponement of hundreds of elective surgeries and which prolonged inpatient stays in hospitals around Australia. Medication shortages are a global problem. The WHO recently reported 300 essential drugs in shortage worldwide. This longstanding problem was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, sequelae of which included increased production costs and increasingly complex logistic challenges. But these issues are and remain compounded by a lack of Australian domestic manufacturers. More than 90 per cent of the medications that we prescribe in this country are imported, most commonly from India and from China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is already an existing mechanism in the Therapeutic Goods Act to allow the secretary of the department to approve the importation or supply of substitutable unapproved products from overseas where the secretary is satisfied that the approved medicine or biological or medical device is already unavailable or is in short supply. The amendment before the House today gives similar powers to the secretary where there is an anticipated shortage of these registered goods. It's important to note that substitutable overseas goods are often in limited supply overseas, and they are often the subject of significant competition between countries which are seeking to secure supplies for their citizens. So this amendment will enable the secretary to try to secure and ensure ongoing supplies of necessary medications for Australians ahead of time, before we get to the situation where the medications are already in short supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the government lacks a comprehensive strategy addressing these medication shortages and how to manage them better when they do occur. We have a medicines supply security guarantee. It was launched in July 2023, and it requires manufacturers to hold at least four to six months of key medications in Australia. However, it has not been enforced. All we are being given with this legislation is a minimal increase in our degree of preparedness for what we seem to be accepting as an inevitable occurrence. It's just not good enough. There are clearly no easy answers to this issue, but there are a number of things which the government could do and yet has not yet done to address the problem. A recent report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Understanding </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the impact of medicine shortages in Australia</span>, found that many Australian patients have to wait a month or more to purchase medicines which are in shortage or they end up having to buy a second medication. As a result of that, 20 per cent of Australians ration their medicines to make them last longer. Clearly, this can result in adverse outcomes for patients. Fourteen per cent of patients who try to find a medication and can't find it end up not buying it at all. Four per cent purchase a non-prescription medicine, and two per cent of them end up in hospital. I'll repeat that—one in 50 Australians affected by medication shortages ends up in our hospital system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These shortages and discontinuations disproportionately impact certain population groups, including First Nations people and Australians living in rural and regional settings. We know that Australians with higher incidences of chronic and complex diseases are those who are more likely to require specialist care. They are more vulnerable to shortages and to discontinuations. They may also have diminished capacity to advocate for alternative scripts, to find the remaining supplies of medications and to source them privately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medication shortages don't just cause inconvenience. For doctors, they result in a need for extra consultations, to identify alternative management options, to write additional or new scripts, to educate patients about the new medications and provide those patients with psychological support around the change, to organise collection or dispensation of new pharmacotherapies and to call pharmacies or the TGA for more information. These activities are made more time consuming when physicians are unfamiliar with alternative preparations or when those new agents require either authority scripts or access via the Special Access Scheme, the paperwork for which is considerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For patients and for pharmacists, uneven and inadequate distribution of medicines is a health equity problem. Delays in accessing or inability to access the best possible medication affects patients negatively. Withdrawal from medications causes side effects that affect patients negatively. Changes in medications can well result in inadvertent overdoses or unexpected side effects. Where alternative medications have to be sourced, that increases the workload of pharmacists. Patients often experience the extra cost associated with these new drugs, but they also have to pay to go back and see their GP when they have to get a second prescription because they can't access the first-choice medication. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The medications affected are often those which are in common use: medications for ADHD and antibiotics. Hormone replacement therapy transdermal patches have been in chronic supply for some years. I have explained to the health minister on a number of occasions that it is a very brave man who gets between a menopausal woman and her HRT, yet the TGA has now advised doctors to limit starting new patients on HRT patches, accepting that this will help preserve available supplies for those people who are already on them. This is what our health system is reduced to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, copper IUDs have been in critical shortage for months at a time. Patients themselves have had to arrange to get them delivered from interstate. The HIV prevention drug PrEP has been in shortage for long periods. We have people at risk of developing HIV because we are not providing them with the medication that they need. Last year there were persistent shortages of the diabetes medication Mounjaro. The long-term national shortage of semaglutide is likely to persist until at least 31 December this year, and that is impacting patients with type 2 diabetes across this country. Finding it and accessing semaglutide, or Ozempic, has been described as being like winning the lottery. I've also heard from a constituent in Kooyong about their anxiety and fear relating to the shortage of cholestyramine powder sachets. These are used as a last-line therapy for people who have undergone an ileal resection and are at risk of severe diarrhoea related to that. There are very limited alternatives for people with that condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a duty to guarantee vulnerable Australians appropriate treatment for their serious medical conditions. At the same time, the recent discontinuation of lomustine capsules sparked a lot of concern in the Australian oncology community. There are very limited alternatives for treatment of glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. Taking away one of those alternatives just causes incredible distress to vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worst of all, I want to draw the parliament's attention to the ongoing critical shortages of medications for palliative care in this country. Liquid morphine has been in shortage for months. I'll give you a few examples of the impact of that shortage on constituents from Kooyong. These are examples provided by my constituents. An 88-year-old gentleman had prostate cancer. He was stable on oral liquid morphine for breathlessness due to his metastatic disease. He was unable to source that medication in the community. He had to go to the emergency department with uncontrolled breathlessness. He was admitted to hospital, where he died. A 56-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer who was stable on long-acting hydromorphone for pain was forced to change to methadone because the hydromorphone was no longer available. She required a two-week hospital admission to titrate her medications to safety. An 85-year-old man with metastatic bowel cancer was admitted to hospital for three weeks due to the need for slow titration onto methadone in lieu of long-acting hydromorphone. A 73-year-old man with end-stage cardiac disease had to attend a hospital palliative care clinic in person for the ongoing prescription and supply of his MS Contin granules because he was unable to source them in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Communication around medication shortages is often poor. Many GPs find out that medications are in shortage from their patients. The frustration relating to medication shortages reduces consumer credibility and trust in healthcare professionals. Many have reported higher rates of physical and verbal abuse when their patients are unable to source the medications that they need. GPs would benefit from collaborative efforts of the TGA, medication suppliers and practice management software producers, who could together relatively easily provide online advice in practice management software regarding discontinuations and supply of the medications that the GPs are prescribing. But the government has not as yet made an effort to put that in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pharmacists know when medications are in short supply in their own facilities, but they don't know which nearby stores will have the medication that might be able to help them. They tell me that they spend hours sometimes calling out to try and help their patients. Some time ago I suggested to the government that it look to establishing a central information point for pharmacists so that they could know what medications are in supply in what sites and save themselves time. Clearly, there are some commercial sensitivities around knowing which pharmacies have what medications, but we could get around these. As far as I know, there has been no progress on this issue from the government to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation in front of the House addresses one part of one aspect of an issue, but it doesn't get to the underlying problem, which is the persisting deficits in the supply chain for many medications in this country; the lack of transparency around those shortages for consumers, doctors and pharmacists; and the inconvenience, the expense and the harm which result from those shortages. We need a better process to identify impending shortages of medications, biologics and devices. Doctors and pharmacists need to know about these shortages and discontinuations sooner. They need greater transparency about the reasons for medication shortages and consistent, location-specific information about stock availability. I'm particularly concerned by the cost of the medication shortages for consumers and the fact that Australians often have to pay more for a second-line or third-line agent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to act on this issue: to develop effective stockpiles of critical medicines; to mandate that medication manufacturers advise the TGA of shortages well in advance; and to ensure that we have duplication of registration by the TGA for those medicines which are critical to public health and safety. I call for the government to use Future Made in Australia or other funding to invest in incentives for the development of a domestic manufacturing industry for critical medicines; to introduce taxation or fiscal incentives to ensure supply of critical medications which might not otherwise be financially viable to introduce into the small Australian market; to review the system of statutory price reductions for older medications so as to temper the price reductions that often lead to PBS delisting; to simplify the special access scheme for unapproved medicines and therapeutic goods; and to enhance the regulatory powers of the TGA to enable it to redistribute scarce medicines to priority patient groups who are at risk of poorer health outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, Assistant Minister, we have to do better to protect vulnerable Australians and to ensure that they receive the very best practice care in our country. At the very least, as a show of good faith in the face of our apparent inability to guarantee access to the optimal medications for these patients' conditions, we have to ensure that Australian patients don't have to pay more to receive lesser medical care.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  Australia has a world-class health system, largely thanks to the various health benefits schemes such as Medicare which help Australians pay for the healthcare they need. In 2023-24, payments for health benefits including medical services, pharmaceutical services and private health insurance rebates totalled at least $65.1 billion. The government is committed to protecting this investment and strengthening Medicare by improving the compliance framework that ensures its integrity. The government commissioned the independent review of Medicare integrity and compliance, known as the Philip review, in November 2022 to respond to concerns about the operation of the Medicare system. The Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review Scheme) Act 2023 and the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review Scheme No. 2) Act 2023 made amendments in response to the recommendations of that Philip review.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will support the integrity and sustainability of Medicare by addressing a range of issues to enable the department to conduct more efficient, timely and effective compliance activities. The bill will improve payment integrity by reducing the time for making bulk-billed claims. The bill will allow investigative powers to be used consistently and effectively across all health schemes, including Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and will improve the processes relating to pharmacy approvals. The bill also makes several sensible amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to enhance the Department of Health and Aged Care's capacity to manage and alleviate the consequences of therapeutic goods shortages and support compliance and enforcement activities undertaken in relation to unlawful therapeutic goods and unlawful vaping goods. These amendments are consistent with this government's unwavering commitment to public health and mitigate the public health risks associated with therapeutic goods and vaping goods by supporting strong and effective regulation under the Therapeutic Goods Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments insert additional integrity measures into the bill, which also implement the findings of the Philip review into Medicare integrity. They make several changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973. They improve existing powers to obtain information about potential fraud and noncompliance and enable the recovery of amounts if they should not have been paid. They improve the ability of regulators to protect patient safety by removing some restrictions on the admission of information obtained under the Professional Services Review notice-to-produce powers as evidence in relevant proceedings, including proceedings for the purposes of the national law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Philip review recommended the expansion of powers to ensure all types of serious noncompliance can be effectively dealt with and a reduction in regulation and legislation that hinders compliance activities. The Philip review concluded that there are limitations and restrictions around current compliance processes. For example, if incorrect payments are identified, current provisions don't always enable amounts to be appropriately recovered. This is because some recovery mechanisms rely on outdated claiming processes and requests for hard-copy documents. These matters are restricting the ability of the Department of Health and Aged Care to protect the integrity of Medicare programs and payments. These changes will enable appropriate inquiries to be made about Medicare payments if available information suggests potential noncompliance or fraud. If payments are found to be incorrect, amounts could be recovered. Further changes will remove some restrictions on the admission of information obtained under the Professional Services Review's notice-to-produce powers as evidence in proceedings, including proceedings under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing restrictions will no longer apply in respect of prosecutions related to a failure to produce documents, proceedings to recover debts relating to the Professional Services Review Scheme and some other proceedings relating to noncompliance. The restrictions will also not apply in respect of documents produced to PSR under notice and passed on to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, Ahpra, or a national board under certain provisions in the Health Insurance Act or information obtained or generated by Ahpra or a national board from its own investigation triggered by documents produced to the PSR under notice. This will enable Ahpra and associated health practitioner boards to use PSR related material to trigger their own investigation into allegations involving risks to patient safety. This will also allow Ahpra and health practitioner boards to admit evidence in national law proceedings if it was referred to them under the legislation for the reasons of a significant threat to life or health or noncompliance with professional standards. These changes are required to ensure all appropriate steps are taken to protect patient safety and that the existing requirement to refer the information to Ahpra and health practitioner boards is not frustrated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, these changes will enhance the Department of Health and Aged Care's capacity to address these identified risks to patient safety and manage and address the consequences of noncompliance and potential fraud. In doing so, these measures will further the government's efforts to strengthen Medicare and will assist to protect the integrity and sustainability of Medicare and its programs. I commend the amendments to the House.</span>

                    </a>  I'll start with the bad news. The bad news is that in 2023 a staggering $2.7 billion was lost to scams in Australia. The good news is that this was 13 per cent lower than the preceding year. But, obviously, it's still far too high. That $2.7 billion figure is just one number, but it entails thousands and thousands of Australian heartache stories. But, as I said, it could have been $350 million or more—much worse.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scams have become increasingly more sophisticated, and many originate from complex transnational criminal syndicates. It's not always easy to spot a scam, yet many victims still feel shame and embarrassment when they find their accounts are a little bit lighter. Each scam that is perpetrated represents an organisation or a person who has been deceived and has lost money. Scams are expensive, distressing and can be financially devastating for victims. That's not to mention the fact that they can stop people from communicating with the rest of the world—they're too scared to answer the phone, too scared to answer emails.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have fallen prey—to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars—to investment scams, fraudulent remote access and romance scams. That is why the Albanese Labor government is focused on developing a whole-of-economy prevention framework. One of our key election commitments was to protect Australians from scammers. Since coming to office we have directed over $180 million to fighting scammers. Part of this funding was directed towards the establishment of the National Anti-Scam Centre, the NASC. It sits within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and serves as a link between industry and government. One of its key aims is to enhance collaboration amongst government, finance, telecommunications, digital platforms sectors and law enforcement to combat scams. The intention of this collaboration is to disrupt scammers, whether that is to prevent contact, to interrupt contact or to stop fraudulent payments being made once a scammer has established a connection with their victim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NASC also runs the Scamwatch service. This is an excellent resource for us all. It shares up-to-date information on scams and offers valuable tips on how to spot a scam. It details the steps to take if you think you've been scanned and enables people to report a scam and therefore keep their friends and neighbours safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has also legislated the establishment and maintenance of a register of legitimate sender IDs by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. This legislation puts an industry standard in place for telecommunications providers who manage SMS traffic. Telco providers are required to check texts with sender IDs to ensure that they're on the register. Those which are not may be blocked or the text message may be tagged with a warning or labelled as fraudulent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is now building on these measures to introduce the Scams Prevention Framework. Broadly speaking, it will require the private sector to adhere to robust industry codes and principles based obligations. The establishment of the framework will tackle head-on the current situation with scam protection, where there is inconsistency across sectors with both protections and responses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill in front of the chamber employs a broad definition of what a scam is. This reflects the dynamic nature of scam activity, which is increasingly technically sophisticated and is continuously evolving. The core business of scammers is to cause harm or loss through deception. The bill reflects that this occurs in a variety of ways and in ever-changing ways. Similarly, the term 'consumer' is broadly defined. In the bill, it includes individuals or small businesses that access services provided by regulated businesses in Australia. Consumers may also use these services while out of the country but still be covered by the bill if the provider is a regulated entity in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first sectors that will be required to comply with the Scams Protection Framework are banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms that provide social media, paid search advertising and direct messaging services. These are the most common avenues that scammers use to target Australians. Scamwatch notes that in 2023 the most reported payment method used by scammers was bank transfers, with nearly $213 million in losses. Phone calls were associated with $116 million worth of losses and social media with nearly $94 million. Most scams originate via social media, phone, email, the internet, mobile apps and text messages, with the bank being the final link in the chain where the funds are transferred. The Scams Prevention Framework will have a consistent and enforceable approach, ensuring that all the components of specific sectors have strong protection. After all, scammers don't use just one method to defraud people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scams Prevention Framework has six overarching principles. The first of these is enhanced governance for regulated entities, including the documentation and implementation of policies and procedures, targets, and the outcomes of scam prevention efforts. The next set of principles concerns regulated entities putting in place reasonable steps to prevent, detect and report scams. This means implementing additional layers of verification and validation procedures online and enhancing processes with the timely identification of scams. It also means alerting consumers as quickly as possible. These measures will help to disrupt the activity of scammers. Regulated entities will also have to report information on scams to the ACCC. Entities must report as soon as it is reasonable to think that the scam activity is underway, whether that's a communication or a transaction. The ACCC may then share this intelligence amongst other entities to disrupt the scammer's activities—that's the collaborative approach that I spoke about earlier. As you can see, to fight scammers effectively you need wide-ranging and concerted tactics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final two principles focus on disruption and response. The bill includes the provision of a 28-day safe harbour protection for regulated entities to take disruptive action, in good faith, while protecting third parties. There's also a requirement to continue consumer education and awareness. To enhance responsiveness to consumers, regulated entities must implement efficient ways for consumers to report scams and lodge complaints. A scam victim will have access to dispute resolution processes free of charge if a regulated entity has not met its obligations within the framework. To this end, regulated entities must demonstrate that they have an internal dispute resolution process and are also a member of a selected external dispute resolution system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The external body responsible for dispute resolution for the initial sectors in the framework will be the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The AFCA will address consumer complaints, including when the scam involves more than one entity. Consumers will also be able to escalate their complaints to the court system if a regulated entity has not operated within the framework appropriately. The dispute system will ensure ease of access for consumers. Basically, there is no wrong-door approach, as consumers can raise an issue with any regulated entity. The AFCA will also respond to consumer scam complaints, even if the issue involves multiple regulatory bodies. Consumers are given extra assurance, with a planned consultation on the dispute resolution model in 2025. We want to ensure it's working as we intend for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scam Protection Framework's mandatory codes will be sector-specific and provide a minimum set of standards for each sector. They also recognise the need to evolve to ensure the ongoing, effective disruption of scams. The bill proposes a multi-regulator approach to build on existing sector expertise. The ACCC will be the regulator for the principle based obligations as well as the digital platforms sector. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will oversee the banking code, and ACMA will enforce the telecommunications code. This approach will ensure that no one body is overwhelmed, especially as additional sectors are brought into the framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Future editions could include superannuation, cryptocurrency, online marketplaces and other payment providers. The bill directs that the responsible Treasury minister can designate additional sectors to be subject to the Scams Prevention Framework. After that, the minister can direct the establishment of an enforceable code that works for that specific sector—tailored for how people interact with that particular sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What powers will the regulatory bodies have? They will be able to penalise an organisation up to $50 million for the worst breaches of the framework. That will obviously be an incentive for compliance. Regulators also have a range of lesser penalties to apply such as infringement notices, injunctions, public warnings and remedial directions, stepping up the process as modern businesses do. It's important to note a key difference between this bill and other international approaches such as in the UK. Labor is not implementing a mandatory-presumption-of-reimbursement approach. We want to address scam activity across all sectors by incentivising all sectors to take responsibility. After all, there are many opportunities to stop scam activity before the consumer loses money, not just at the point of the bank transfer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is world leading. The Assistant Treasurer highlighted Australia's leadership of this issue when he attended the first Global Fraud Summit, in March 2024, and this bill reflects Australia's commitment to working with international partners on fighting scams. At the heart of this legislation is our determination to better protect consumers. We are determined to make Australia a harder target for scammers. Australians deserve to be able to participate in the digital economy safely and with confidence. The bill gives consumers additional peace of mind, knowing they have both strengthened protections and avenues for dispute resolution if required if it all goes bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a final note, I would like to thank the assistant minister, Stephen Jones. I know that he is leaving the parliament, and I particularly want to thank him for bringing scams to the front of people's minds throughout Australia along with how we as a nation can fight back. Rather than just retreat from scammers, now we are fighting back. I thank him for that. As I said at the start, we still lose too much. It is 13 per cent less this year than last year, which is $350 million, and it could have been a lot worse, but so much of that is down to Minister Jones. He has been a good friend and a good man. He is also a Dragons supporter, so that means the minister and I are the two Dragons supporters leaving the parliament, which I know is a great fact to him! Hopefully, some of the candidates who get elected will also be Dragons supporters. I wish him well, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  Scammers are the scum of the earth. Scammers target vulnerable Australians, but make no mistake: they come after every Australian. Scammed Australians are not stupid; they are victims. I want to start with those statements of principles because I fear that, in the debate about scams, vulnerable Australians—victims—are ignored and, in fact, sometimes insulted by their banks. I fear that the debate on the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024 and in the scam space is all about the banks and people who hold shares in banks and not about their customers, the victims, the vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are vulnerable Australians like 82-year-old widow Emily, from Mildura in my electorate, who lost her husband in June last year. Shockingly, just a few weeks later, a message popped up on her computer screen that she was being scammed. The message told Emily to call a 1800 number to speak with Microsoft. A voice at the end of the line said they were trying to track down the scammers and wanted her help with a sting operation. They asked for her account details so they could put money in her account to transfer to the scammers to assist with the police operation. Instead, these scumbags were the true scammers and helped themselves to $157,000 from her bank account. And how much did her bank agree to reimburse her? You won't believe this, Deputy Speaker. It was just $22.36.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to Emily during the final sitting week of last year, and she told me how she felt so ashamed at being scammed, so embarrassed, that she didn't want to tell her adult children. This is so wrong. Emily should never have felt ashamed. No-one who has been scammed should feel ashamed. And if you have been scammed, I want to make this clear: you have been manipulated, disempowered and gaslit by people who intended nothing but evil towards you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Emily's bank representatives here in Canberra soon after speaking with her about this situation because I felt it was fundamentally wrong, and I told them as much. After some discussion, I am pleased to say that a settlement was reached. This is what Emily had to say about the outcome:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was getting nowhere going through the bank fraud people. So I thought, it's a lot of money, I want to try as hard as I can to be recompensed for something. So I went to my member of Parliament, who I vote for and always will!—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say that's always a lovely message—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I've been astounded at the result. I didn't know members of parliament had such contacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, it is my job and my privilege as a parliamentarian to help Emily and people like her, but why does it have to come to this? Why do members of parliament end up being ombudsmen and clearing houses for sensible decision-making that simply should have been appropriately handled in the first place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Emily is an intelligent woman. I dare anyone in this place to call Emily stupid. I don't believe anyone in this place would call Emily stupid. Emily's family told me that she is computer savvy, creates invoices on the computer and does a lot of internet banking, and, as they say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">She's not easily fooled and has been caught at a moment of vulnerability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate: Emily is not stupid, but that is the implied message that sits behind the banks' collective treatment of victims like Emily and, I am sorry to say, behind this legislation in its current form. Investment scams are a big portion of Australia's scam losses. Emily's story—and I'm about to share more—falls outside the approximately $1.3 billion in Australian investment scam losses. Surely, if there is concern about what a mandatory reimbursement of customers might mean for banks and their shareholders, the primary group for protection should be everyday Australians who are not trying to invest money but are tricked into handing over personal details.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give some of those personal stories. The wife of one of my staff bought tickets to go to a museum on a state government website. Their credit card details were taken, and a scammer helped themselves to buy some Armani goods in Asia. That family only got their money back by threatening legal action. They have since changed banks, something banks would do well to remember. As I prepared to speak on this bill late last year, while discussing Emily's case with her bank, another of my staff was here in Canberra and put her husband on speakerphone. His home computer was frozen, and he was on another line to a 1800 number—which the on-screen message had directed him to—claiming to be Microsoft. Here we go again. It wasn't Microsoft; it was scammers. They would most likely have asked for personal information to access his finances, just like Emily. However, there were several of us in the office at the time who told him to hang up immediately, shut the computer down and invest in some reputable computer security protection. It's a really good idea; if you don't have it, I would strongly recommend that you get some.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have another story. A publican in my electorate thought he was ordering beer for his pub from his regular website. He wasn't. He said goodbye to tens of thousands of dollars. I won't name him, but good luck telling him he's stupid. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Maryborough </span><span style="font-style:italic;">District </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> newspaper in the south-east of my electorate told the sad story of Janet, who lost $30,000 she had saved for her children. Janet got a call from someone claiming to be Telstra and saying her phone had been hacked. She was unwell at the time with a punctured lung and pneumonia and was taken to hospital the next day, so she was convinced the so-called technicians were there to help her. In the circumstances, would you call Janet stupid? I don't think so. Janet was vulnerable, and the scammers are scumbags. But it gets worse. Janet later found her money in her bank was gone. Janet was initially relieved to hear from her bank that she was going to get some money back. What did she receive? $3.66. That would ease the burden, wouldn't it? $3.66—there must be some one per cent rule the banks are using to recompense victims. My word to them is: thanks very much on behalf of everyone who is being scammed!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-six-year-old Vietnam War veteran Danny McIver, another Mallee constituent, lost $70,000. We're not talking peanuts here; we're talking about people's life savings. He lost it from the life insurance payout he got from the death of his son, Robert, who died two weeks after Danny lost his daughter, Sharon, to motor neurone disease. The scam? Another Microsoft impersonation scam, last September. Danny told news.com.au that he couldn't believe it took the bank nearly two hours to discover that funds had been taken out of his bank account four times. None of these were investment scams—just people caught out by scammers that target the vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the United Kingdom, prior to the new 7 October mandatory obligation, the majority of banks were voluntarily reimbursing their customers 72 per cent of the time. In contrast, in Australia, the voluntary bank reimbursement figure is less than five per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Global Anti-Scam Alliance say that in the most recent reporting year scammers have taken a whopping $1 trillion. As they note, that rivals the GDP of some nations. In countries like Pakistan, their scam losses are equivalent to 4.2 per cent of their GDP. It's 3.6 per cent in Kenya and 3.4 per cent in South Africa. The Global Anti-Scam Alliance said in their latest report Australians lose US$1,452 per capita per year to scams, well below US$3,500 in the United States and US$1,800 in the UK. The Global Anti-Scam Alliance report found that globally, when survey respondents were asked who they expect to ensure scam victims are reimbursed, they answered the online platform used by the scammer, the website they used or the bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation we have before us today doesn't seem to be drafted to protect Emily, Janet, Danny, my staff, their families or vulnerable Australians but rather to protect banks. The new United Kingdom legislation—introduced by the now former Conservative government, I might add—relates to so-called authorised push payment, or APP, scams. Britain mandated that banks must compensate scam victims 99.9 per cent of the time. Further, the UK system defines some customers as vulnerable and does not require them to exercise a standard of caution. That is, other customers are required to show they have not demonstrated gross negligence. Vulnerable customers are also not required to carry the 100 pounds excess on their reimbursement. Britain's maximum reimbursement is 85,000 pounds. The banks at either end of the transaction must pay half that cost each.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me ask you this. Who is best placed to protect bank customers from scammers: vulnerable customers like Emily, the recently bereaved widow, or the banks themselves? Who is best placed to go chasing social media companies or internet platforms for responsibility: widows like Emily or Janet, with her punctured lung and pneumonia, or the banks? Clearly the United Kingdom have decided that, no matter what role social media or internet platforms have played, the fairest and best outcome for victims is for them to be reimbursed. The banks can go hunting the platforms after that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am furious—and I have been furious since last year—that vulnerable Mallee constituents are being scammed. And now let me disclose my own interest. I too have been scammed. I bought tickets to a big hotel in Melbourne, only to discover afterwards the ticket website that they had moved me onto was fake, and money was taken from me—$9,000, in fact. My pathway to getting reimbursed by the bank was not straightforward. I'm not embarrassed by being scammed. I'm angry, but I'm not embarrassed. I've had private conversations with members here, and they admit they have been scammed as well. It is becoming far too common. Over $2 billion is lost to scams in Australia every year, with around $2.74 billion lost in the 2023 year. That contrasts with over one billion pounds per annum being scammed in the United Kingdom across their population in recent reporting years. Yet they've gone all in, compelling banks to reimburse customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians were the victims of around 601,000 reported scams in the last reporting year, up 18.5 per cent, and both the number of reported scams and the amounts lost are just that—reported. There could be a whole lot more from embarrassed people who don't want to admit that they've been scammed. Are Australians stupid? Are my constituents stupid? No. Yet the implied message in this bill is we need to protect the banks, not vulnerable Australians. Labor's solution in this bill is not immediate reimbursement; it is handing vulnerable Australians a snakes-and-ladders board where they roll the dice and move up and down the ladders and slip down the snakes. Internal dispute mechanisms, external dispute mechanisms, legal action against the bank—really? Is this the best the government can do?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hasten to add in this banking regulation space that more than half of Australian ATMs have closed in the last six years, and many of my constituents who rely on cash can't get to an ATM in their town or anywhere near where they live. It's well and good for the government to be talking about mandating the use of cash in essential service contexts, albeit with potential small-business exemptions, but, if regional Australians can't withdraw cash, what then? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge anyone watching or reading to go to www.scamwatch.gov.au for the latest information on scams and on how protect yourself and to discuss sensible protective behaviours. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  Scams take many forms. They include investment scams, remote access scams and romance scams. I remember making a speech, as what we now call the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, in the Brisbane convention centre in relation to what we were doing in respect of fraud and scams involving credit cards, and I said to the departmental officials: 'Is this correct? This figure that I've got to talk about is in the billions, not millions.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when I look back on the nine years of the Morrison government, the Abbott government before that and the Turnbull government wedged in between, they did nothing. We get lectures from those opposite about it, but they did nothing in relation to the issue over nine long years. So we won't cop this criticism that they're making of us. Before we brought forward this legislation, we invested $180 million. And we've actually got scam losses in Australia down from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $2.7 billion in 2023. That's a decline of 13.1 per cent because of the action taken by this Labor government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're taking steps, and we've got this legislation before the chamber, which will make a big difference. But we've still got a situation in this country where about 601,000 Australians were scammed last year, including some in this place. We all have family and friends who have been scammed, and scams take many forms and are insidious and clever. I remember being on a number of parliamentary committees involving gambling when people anonymously or privately were giving us evidence in relation to the way they were scammed. These were very prominent people in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that this legislation, I believe, will make a difference. It's the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024. The Albanese government is protecting people from the scourge of scams, and we're taking this seriously. We want to make Australia the toughest place in the world for scammers to operate, and we are making a difference. We know that scam activity is on the rise. That doesn't mean to say that people are falling for it, but the activity is there. That wonderful thing which we call the internet has allowed people from all parts of the world to tap into it and present themselves as some person who truly loves you and wants you to give them money because they're in desperate need, or they've got some sort of scam all over the place. Maybe they've got a get-rich-quick scheme, and it looks fantastic: 'If you only invest in it, you'll do well.' So it takes many forms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current scam protections are a bit all over the place. They're not consistent across the economy, and there are different protections and responses across different industries and providers. So we're taking up the fight. This is an all-encompassing framework. It's coherent. It will make a difference. It's about prevention, detection, disruption and response. The Scams Prevention Framework, as we call it, will become an important part, the central part, of the government's broader consumer protection agenda. So this will make a difference. We're providing some strong defences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This landmark legislation has been criticised by those opposite, but I notice that in nine years they didn't do anything like this. This landmark legislation delivers on an election commitment. We knew in opposition that we had to do things. We knew that the previous government had sat on their hands. It didn't matter whether the Prime Minister was an Abbott, Turnbull or Morrison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes a whole-of-economy approach. It places obligations on key businesses through the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The framework is the cornerstone delivering on our commitment. The legislation puts real obligations on banks, social media companies and telcos to prevent scams or face hefty fines and compensation for victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker talked about the difficulties. That's why we want to take action. Under the framework, designated businesses—initially banks, social media platforms and telecommunications companies, where a lot of the scam activity currently occurs—will face fines of up to $50 million if they don't take reasonable steps to prevent, detect, disrupt, respond to and report scams and attempted scams in their business. Victims will have clear pathways to compensation if businesses fail in their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, gets new powers under this legislation to direct businesses to take specific steps to keep their customers safe from scammers, and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority—who, I might add, could do a lot better on insurance issues in relation to floods—will be empowered to resolve consumer claims over scams in these sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers were left to fend for themselves before we put big business on the hook for redress when they failed to stop scammers. Once the legislation passes, the framework will enable the minister to establish some sector-specific codes, and the codes will impose mandatory obligations on banks and the other organisations that I talked about. It will mandate that these designated sectors have internal dispute resolution mechanisms that are clear, accessible and transparent for consumers. We're familiar with this type of process, and I don't know why we're being criticised for it, because it operates across a whole range of sectors in the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, social media platforms have no mechanism for consumers to raise disputes. In addition, the framework will allow the minister to make rules setting out guidance on how to apportion liability at an internal dispute resolution between one or more businesses who are at fault to assist victims seeking redress. It will enable a single external dispute resolution scheme for scam complaints made under the framework where a dispute cannot be resolved through internal dispute resolution. AFCA operates like that now on insurance issues, for a start. It will build a mandatory coordinated intelligence sharing ecosystem that requires timely reporting and information sharing across industry and government. I might add that the reforms have been subject to extensive consultation—it's a pity those opposite didn't listen to the people who gave us feedback—and stakeholders broadly support the system that we're bringing in. It's also worth noting that other sectors, such as superannuation, cryptocurrency, online marketplaces and other payment providers, may be designated under the framework in future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there has been some criticism that the legislation is too soft on the banks. The previous speaker said that it was just on the banks and nothing else. There have been calls for the framework to go further, particularly in respect of mandatory reimbursement by banks. The government have not taken a mandatory presumption of reimbursement approach, like the United Kingdom's, because we want to incentivise actions to address scam activity across the entire scam activity chain, including banks, tech platforms and telcos, and not leave some sectors with lower expectations and responsible for liability. We don't want just one sector to be responsible; we want the whole chain to be responsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rationale is that placing liability on banks alone fails to recognise and hold to account entities that have had many opportunities to stop a scam before harm is caused to the consumer. It's the same thing in all forms of litigation: you look at the different groups and organisations who are at fault. Whether it's negligence or breach of contract, you look at everyone. You don't pick on one particular sector or one particular business. That may be why we've seen some of the banks come out and raise concerns about social media companies' management of scams on their platforms. The framework will ensure that all points of the scam chain are held to account, as it is common for scammers to use multiple platforms and services to steal from consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee's report on the bill recommended it be passed. I know that as part of that inquiry a range of views on the bill and our Scams Prevention Framework were expressed by both parliamentarians and stakeholders. Some of the claims from the Greens and crossbench senators in the context of the inquiry, suggesting the government was protecting banks, were frankly ridiculous. As I said before, our world-first approach will ensure all parts of the scams chain have to account for the actions they take to protect consumers. The banks themselves have said that when they're at fault they will reimburse victims, and that will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working to ensure consumers get swift access to justice and that we have the right incentives in place to protect their interests. We're deliberately taking a preventative approach so scams don't happen in the first place, because it's always better to prevent a crime happening than to rely on compensation. The reality is that this is the toughest legislation the world has seen, and it's clear that there's strong support for it to pass. We'll work through some of the details, but the overwhelming message from the inquiry was that strong prevention measures are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just one part of an ambitious anti-scam agenda the government is rolling out to protect Australians. We've already set up the National Anti-Scam Centre and Scamwatch service—that was in July last year—as part of our $86.5 million investment to fight scams and online fraud in the 2023-24 budget. The National Anti-Scam Centre, located within the ACCC, is a world-leading partnership between government law enforcement agencies and the private sector. It means consumers can look to a trusted centralised point within government for information and education to protect themselves from scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, just last month the government launched the Fighting Scams Campaign, which includes TV and social media ads running until 22 March. This campaign is about equipping Australians with simple, actionable strategies to guard against scams. The key messages are: stop before sharing personal information; check that you know who you're dealing with; protect against scams by taking actions like reporting them to scamwatch.gov.au.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see the Australian Banking Association back in the scams awareness campaign which is part of our response. Everyone needs to do their bit. The government's action is about keeping people's money safe through our prevention strategy, and I think it's showing early success. Losses have almost halved since we stood up the National Anti-Scam Centre. Scamwatch data shows that reported scam losses dropped by 40 per cent in the 2023-24 financial year compared to the previous year. This bill will implement the framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the National Anti-Scam Centre and the Fighting Scams Campaign, our important role—as the previous speaker said, and I agree with her—is to raise awareness in the local community. In July last year I was delighted to have the Minister for Financial Services at a community scams forum in Ipswich. It was an opportunity for locals to learn ways to protect themselves from scams, to know what to do if they're targeted by a scam and to hear more about the steps the government was taking to crack down on this crime. A number of government and community organisations attended: Australia Post; Services Australia; Queensland Police Service; and IDCARE, the national identity and cyber support service. They provided information and feedback on scams impacting the local community in Ipswich as well. Police officers, such as respected police sergeant Nadine Webster from the Ipswich District Crime Prevention Unit, spoke at the forum and reported that local police had succeeded in shutting down a scam operation just around the time that the members of the public came forward with information, and she gave a very detailed account of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to see the work of the local Queensland police, but there were some very sad stories too. We heard that day—and in our offices we hear all the time—about scammers ripping money out of the pockets of hardworking locals. The IDCARE data shows that about $1 million had been lost to scams in Ipswich in the previous six months. For example, we heard from a constituent, Peter, who had been conned out of $130,000 when he thought he was investing in a safe term deposit through a broker. Many people talked about experiencing persistent calls, spams, texts and misleading advertisements on social media attempting to scam them out of their money. I thank local people in Ipswich for coming forward at the forum and being so open about what they had experienced. What it shows is that it's more important than ever for people in my community to be alert and aware of how to protect themselves. It also highlights why this legislation we're debating today is just so urgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I will say that the Albanese government has made scams a priority. We do get the financial and emotional turmoil. It was on full display at the scams forum last year in Ipswich. We want to rid Australia of this. We'll work together with anyone and everyone in relation to this. We want to ensure that people keep more of what they earn, and we're going to make sure that they keep their money safe. We're determined to crack down on criminals who rip off hardworking Australians. By sending a clear message that this harmful practice won't be tolerated here in any way at all, we're making Australia the hardest place for scammers to ply their trade. We want to make sure that victims know that we have their backs. We know more needs to be done, and that's why this legislation is before the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community want tough action to protect their money and prevent crime. They want information. They want these laws delivered in the fight against scammers. I urge the parliament to do the right thing by the people in my community, whether they live in Ipswich or the Somerset region or around Karana Downs. I want this whole parliament to support this legislation to ensure consumers get the protection they need as soon as possible. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299623" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I rise today in support of the government's efforts to address the scourge of scams in this country, but I do so with significant concerns about the way they've approached the problem in this, the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024. The prevalence and pernicious impact of scams in this country means that real, tangible efforts to address them is urgent. Many other countries are forging ahead to protect their citizens. Australia is lagging behind and needs to do the same. The UK has set a strong precedent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the scams landscape in Australia so that we get a sense of the scale of the problem. Last year we lost $2.74 billion in this country to scams. That's more than $5,200 per minute, all day, every day, and that's only the scams we know about. People are invariably ashamed to discover they have been scammed, duped and fleeced, so many scam victims never report what has happened to them. Let's put those Australian losses in perspective. The $2.74 billion a year that we lose to scams is 18 per cent more than what the people of the UK lose to scams, and that number is not per capita; the UK has 2½ times Australia's population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the extent that there is a debate about scams regulation creating a honey pot—more on that a bit later—the fact is that we are already a honey pot for scams. It's hard to imagine how proper regulation could make it worse, and, despite what the big banks would have you believe, they are not doing nearly enough to prevent scams taking hold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to point out that, when we talk about scams, we're not talking about fraud. Fraud is when a third party steals your identity or your credit card and steals from you without your knowledge. That loss is not included in the figures I've just mentioned, and, more importantly, as many of us know, is typically reimbursed by financial institutions. A scam is when we ourselves authorise a transaction—give our money away—but under false pretences, to scammers who have promised a reward, an investment return or something similar. It's more complicated when you yourself have handed over your own money, and it's more embarrassing and more traumatising for the victim. Like the scourge of domestic violence in this country, no-one is too well off, too educated or too sophisticated to be safe from falling victim to a scam. My community is, appropriately, very concerned about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I was elected, I've been contacted by many constituents who have been the victim of absolutely terrible scams or have had loved ones who have been. Everybody knows someone who has been a victim. And it's not just the victim of the scam that is impacted; entire families are affected, particularly when life-changing amounts of money are lost. To respond to that concern, I've partnered with Scamwatch to host community information sessions on scam prevention. Scamwatch is the Australian government initiative designed to help consumers stay one step ahead of the scammers. Recently, I held a webinar with Stephanie Tonkin, the CEO of the Consumer Action Law Centre, to help equip my constituents with the information they need to best protect themselves. These sessions were indeed very popular, and the stories of the scams that people had fallen prey to were alarming, to say the least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent wrote to me about her 93-year-old mother being scammed. It was only after a serious car accident, fearing that she might die, that her mother admitted to having been scammed. The scam involved direct phone calls to her mother from people purporting to be from the Federal Police and from her bank, and the scam played out over several months. The scammers managed to convince her that the only way she could keep her savings secure was to move her money around to other accounts by buying gift cards, sending cheques to various places and making large transfers to unknown people. They used every trick in the book. The scammers took advantage of her age and her vulnerability; her trust in authority, typical of that generation; and her lack of computer skills. In the end, this scam involved six financial institutions and resulted in my constituent's mother losing $800,000. Six financial institutions were involved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to my constituent's diligence in pursuing this matter over 18 months, around $150,000 of that money that was scammed away was recovered. But recovering even this portion of the money has been exhausting work for her. In her experience, the position of the majority of the financial institutions was to blame the victim, implying negligence or carelessness. It was not that she was preyed upon by fraudsters or that the bank ought to have done so much more to protect her, a vulnerable customer. The banking institutions are privy to a vast amount of information that we the public do not have access to. The constituent who wrote to me could not have summed up the position any better:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Banks in Australia are institutions of immense wealth and status. They exercise a very powerful role in our society …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It follows … that community expectation is for the highest standards of professionalism. To me, this would extend to exceeding minimum standards which are seemingly no longer fit for purpose, and crucially being proactive in responding to changing circumstances, in particular to the increased occurrence and destructive effects of scams, as well as being responsive to the needs and vulnerabilities of elderly customers, by ensuring the most effective, best-designed systems of protection are in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe said that their data indicates that scammers are targeting older Australians with retirement savings who might be looking for investment opportunities. So I am disappointed by the path the government has chosen to take to address this devastating issue, as the consumer—the victim—has been sidelined and neglected in this piece of legislation. The main argument that has been offered by the government to reject the reimbursement model is the honey pot, or moral hazard, argument. The argument goes that, if financial or other designated institutions automatically reimburse victims, then victims would take less care with their investments, knowing the reimbursement was guaranteed. The scams market would open right up, and scammers would flock here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is already the honey pot. As I mentioned earlier, Australians lose 18 per cent more to scammers than people in the UK do, and that is not taking into account the fact that their population is 2.5 times larger than ours. In 2022, in Australia, only 13 per cent of attempted scam payments were stopped by the banks before they occurred. Once completed, only two to five per cent of scams victims were reimbursed for their losses—a miniscule amount. In the UK, by contrast, the top four banks pay out 49 to 73 per cent of losses, and those statistics come from before the UK introduced an automatic reimbursement scheme. This is from when it was still voluntary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the evidence that Australia will become a honey pot? We have been shown none. The impact analysis in the explanatory memorandum of the bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The core objectives of the government's policy response would be to both reduce scam harms and align the benefits and costs of scam prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say that Treasury has considered two options as part of that policy response. Option 1 is 'maintain the status quo'. In other words, do nothing. How is this considered a policy option robust enough to include in an explanatory memorandum for a bill of this kind? It is absolutely confounding. Option 2 is 'establish the Scams Prevention Framework'. This is just weird. In other words, the government considered no other alternatives to the option they settled on. They did not analyse scam prevention systems established in other, similar countries. Specifically, they did not adequately consider an automatic reimbursement model as has already been implemented in the UK. In fact, the only reference to the UK's reimbursement model in the explanatory memorandum is to reject, in two sentences, the strong joint recommendation of the Consumer Action Law Centre, CHOICE and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. Their call was to mirror the UK's reimbursement framework here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In rejecting that proposal, the government states that it would, and I paraphrase, place a presumption of liability for scams losses onto one sector—that is, the banks—with minimal incentives for other sectors, such as telecommunications and digital platforms, to accept liability for not meeting their obligations. Let's break that down for a moment. In one breath, the government has rejected the recommendations of the peak consumer bodies in this country, because the banks would be negatively impacted, more so than the telcos or the tech companies. But where, in this analysis, is the consumer? Where is the victim? Where is the policy objective, let alone the policy response, of reimbursing what could be the loss of a victim's entire life savings? It leaves the victim in the position of having to potentially fight multiple financial institutions, telcos and social media companies for reimbursement. Talk about an uneven playing field. Furthermore, the peak bodies have quite rightly pointed out that the apportionment of liability between banks, telcos and social media companies could easily be done another way: among themselves, based on precedent, after the victim has been reimbursed. Why should the victim be further punished by having to wait months and often years for reimbursement?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The constituent whose story I described earlier urged me to call on the government to adopt the recommendations of the Consumer Action Law Centre, CHOICE and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network to implement a reimbursement model. I'm here to do so. She shared her story with me, and I share it in this place to lend support to ensuring that a world-leading, highly effective, consumer-protecting scams prevention framework is legislated.</span>

We have some legislation, particularly in the Federation Chamber, which deals with crimes which are happening in real time. Given that we are very close to the end of the speaking list, if we have a chance to get an agreement with the parliament to be able to deal with that more quickly, I think it's well and truly in the national interest for us to do so.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I wonder how many have seen the newest ad campaign, with the bloke about to send a deposit for a lounge online when a little voice—which is his own—on his shoulder makes him stop. There's the lady being asked about her bank details whose voice says she should check, and the bloke who's been told his account is overdrawn who listens to the voice telling him it's a dodgy email and shouldn't he protect himself. This is part of a new campaign, the Fighting Scams Campaign, which includes TV commercials and social media ads that are running now. They're designed to equip Australians with simple, actionable strategies to guard against scams—things like, 'Stop before you share your personal information,' 'Check that you know exactly who you're dealing with' and 'Protect yourself against scams by taking actions, like reporting them to Scamwatch'. I think it's a really useful ad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have tools like that and <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Little </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Book </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Scams</span>, which I've been sharing far and wide in my community. But the Albanese government's work on scams goes way beyond simply raising awareness and asking people to take responsibility. Scammers are clever, cunning and criminal, and our comprehensive plan is about making Australia the toughest target in the world for scammers. This includes having everyone doing their bit, whether it's government, business or individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you mention the word 'scams' in the community, it doesn't take much for stories of fear and trepidation to come tumbling out. Whether it's a young person, a busy mum, a dad on the sporting sideline, a retiree or even my own husband or mum, everyone has a story of an attempted scam that they headed off at the pass. What is really distressing, though, is where the scam wasn't avoided. The tales of lost money or ongoing financial loss—which started with a dodgy Facebook ad, an email that looked legitimate, text messages that sounded credible or a phone call that you'd swear was the real thing—are just gut wrenching. Anyone can be a target of a scammer. Whether you're 20 or 70, everyone should stay scam alert.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has made scams a priority because we get the financial and emotional turmoil that victims face, and we want to rid Australia of this scourge. Since being elected, the government's committed more than $180 million to combatting scams and online fraud. Our actions to date are helping keep people's money safe, with our prevention strategy showing some early signs of success. Losses have been almost cut in half since we stood up the National Anti-Scam Centre. Scamwatch data shows reported scam losses dropped by more than 40 per cent in the 2023-24 financial year compared to the previous year. This bill, the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024, is a vital next step, putting obligations on banks, social media companies and telcos to prevent scams or to face hefty fines and compensation for victims. It means that banks, social media platforms and telecommunication companies will have their responsibilities, and victims will have clear pathways to compensation if the businesses fail to meet those new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In discussing scams, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the Assistant Treasurer for the years of work that he's done in this area. I think I had the first scam forum in the country, just before the 2022 election, at the Windsor Wharf in the Hawkesbury, where local Hawkesbury residents shared with us some of their bad experiences and near misses. I think what was interesting about that forum is that it also drew people from the Blue Mountains part of my electorate who had been so badly impacted they wanted to travel to be part of it. For me that was one of the really galvanising events, where you could see that every person either had already been impacted or deeply feared being impacted by scams. They were thirsty for tools to help keep themselves safe. It also highlighted for me that an individual can do only so much and that the system had to change so there were protections and punishments for poor practices that led to someone being scammed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there have been positive signs from the government's and industry's efforts to date to combat scams, but scam losses remain unacceptably high. In 2023 scammers stole $2.7 billion from Australians, and scammers continue to cause psychological and emotional harm for victims and their families. Current scam protections are piecemeal and inconsistent across the economy, and consumers face inconsistent protections and responses across different industries and providers. This Scams Prevention Framework being introduced is world-leading legislation. It's a central part of our broader consumer protection agenda. I'm going to call the Scams Prevention Framework the SPF—think of sunscreen, providing you with a protective layer. It's a bit like that. It's an economy-wide reform to protect consumers from scams by requiring the private sector to adhere to consistent principle based obligations and strong tailored industry codes which are enforceable. This approach will ensure that incentives and obligations are in place across key sectors that we know scammers take advantage of to cause harm to people in the community. This framework will ensure that all parts of the ecosystem used by scammers are held to account for implementing strong and effective protections that are specifically tailored to their sector and their role in the conduct of a scam. This is essential for the protection of consumers, as it's really common for scammers to use multiple platforms and services to deceive and steal from people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, regulated entities will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent, detect, report, disrupt and respond to scams and to have governance arrangements in place relating to how they will protect consumers from scams. There'll be mandatory sector-specific codes—a sector-specific code, even if adopted, does not relieve a business from their obligations to take reasonable steps in all circumstances, recognising that scams constantly evolve, so businesses must constantly evolve in their responses as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks, telecommunication providers and certain digital platforms offering social media, paid search advertising and direct messaging services will initially be designated under the SPF, as they represent key points of harm—where the harm begins for consumers. It's interesting to note that bank transfer was the most reported method used by scammers, with $212.9 million in reported losses in 2023. Phone calls and social media were the contact methods associated with the highest value of losses, $116 million and $93.5 million respectively in 2023. Other sectors may be designated under the SPF in future, such as superannuation, cryptocurrency, online marketplaces and other payment providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I want to pause and reflect on the breadth of this legislation and highlight some evidence that I took from Meta at the social media inquiry that I was a member of. At that inquiry last year, I was extremely disappointed to hear from Meta that they did not feel they had responsibility for the scam ads that people pay them to have on their platform. These ads can be the first part of a scam; that can be where it starts. Meta argued in their evidence to us that they bore no responsibility, because the taking of someone's money happened off their platform, further down the line. So they were happy to take money from people who, it could be argued, were pretty obviously scammers or potential scammers, but they had nothing to do with any downstream impacts where other people lost money to these same advertisers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's one of the reasons why we need a comprehensive approach and we need multiple regulators involved, and this legislation provides for just that, a multiregulator model, involving the ACCC as the regulator for the principle based obligations and the ACCC, ASIC and ACMA as regulators for the sector-specific codes so that they capitalise on the existing industry knowledge and expertise each of those regulators has. It also ensures that no single regulator will be spread too thin as SPF expands to additional sectors as scam activity inevitably shifts. Regulators have access to significant civil penalties of up to $50 million for the very worst breaches of the SPF. This is designed to incentivise compliance and make sure it's not simply easier to pay the penalty. Regulators will also have other compliance tools available, such as infringement notices, enforceable undertakings, injunctions, public warnings and remedial directions to ensure the SPF is administered as intended—to protect consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers, for their part, will have access to free and transparent dispute resolution processes if they are victims of scams and one or more regulated entities have not met their obligations. There also needs to be internal dispute resolution at the regulated entities and a process in place at each of them, and they must become members of a designated external dispute resolution scheme. There will be a no-wrong-door policy for internal dispute processes, so, rather than being shunted around from regulator to regulator, consumers can approach any of the regulated entities connected to the scam they've experienced to raise a dispute. We want to make it easy for people to pursue that. We've already announced our intention to authorise the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, as the external dispute resolution scheme for the three initial sectors. This single-door approach means consumers only have to go to one body to escalate their scam complaint, even where it may involve multiple regulated entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has not taken a mandatory presumption-of-reimbursement approach as operates in the UK, because we want to incentivise actions to address scam activity across the entire scam activity chain, not leave some sectors with lower expectations and lower responsibility for the liability. Placing liability on banks alone fails to recognise and hold to account the entities that may have had opportunities to stop the scam before the harm is caused to the consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers will also be able to take action in court when they've suffered loss or damage because a regulated entity hasn't met its obligations under the SPF. As with the intention for the external dispute resolution, liability for loss or damage where more than one regulated entity has not met obligations can be apportioned between multiple regulated entities. So this is about shifting the responsibility, ensuring everyone at every point takes responsibility for the things that they could do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the start. There is work to do throughout the year once this bill is passed, and I hope it will be. What this bill does do is ensure that we deliver on the pre-election promise that we made, including to the people of the Hawkesbury at the forum at the Windsor Wolves footy club that the Assistant Treasurer attended. We made a promise that we would do everything we could to protect the community from scammers. This is a really significant step that gives Australia a world-leading framework to be able to do just that—to keep consumers safe. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  Australia is a honey pot for scams. Our lack of regulation and industry protection for consumers permitted more than 600,000 scams in 2023, a record number and an increase of 18.5 per cent on the previous year according to the ACCC. The National Anti-Scam Centre tells us that Australians lost $2.74 billion to scams in 2023, but its data is limited because it tells us only about those scams which have actually been reported to the ACCC's Scamwatch unit. Probably the best data is that from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which, frustratingly, collects a much different dataset to that of the ACCC. The ABS reports that most scams are relatively low value, of the order of a few hundred or a few thousand dollars. It seems quite likely that scams of that size are underreported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 50 per cent of people affected by larger-scale scams report them to their banks, but, critically, only 8.7 per cent report them to government organisations or departments. So the government's figures do not include scams that individuals only report to their banks, to the telcos, to the police or to other government agencies like ASIC, the ACMA or the ATO. That means the figure we're given and often use—of almost $3 billion lost to scams in Australia last year—is more than likely a vast underestimation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons for the increasing prevalence of scams. The rapid digitalisation of the economy has had a dual edge. While online facilities and online banking have enhanced many of our individual conveniences, they have also facilitated the rise of scams. The reality is that for years the banks, telcos and digital companies have not taken the necessary steps to adequately protect customers. Australians have had to continue to experience serious financial and security harm in the face of this failed self-regulation. There is now a critical need for government and businesses to act effectively and with purpose to protect consumers from these increasingly devious and sophisticated schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has taken a proactive stance to scams prevention, and it is appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of the Assistant Treasurer and his team and their deep engagement in this space. I have to say, as the co-chair and founder of the Parliamentary Friends of Scams Protection, that the Assistant Treasurer has been supportive and responsive, and I thank him for that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent initiatives by this government have included the National Anti-Scam Centre, launching the SMS sender ID registry and boosting ASIC's scam-disruption activities. These measures have decreased investment scams, but those on social media platforms continue to increase. Digital platforms, telcos and banks have not done enough to limit those losses. For example, the SMS sender ID registry needs to be mandatory. In Singapore, we've seen that a mandatory ID registry led to a 67 per cent reduction in scams. We have seen in this country what happens when institutions don't act on spoofed phone numbers. Probably the best example of that was HSBC's reckless and indifferent failure to respond to the spoofing of many hundreds of Australians over many months. That led to a loss of millions of dollars by Australians, some of whom live in the electorate that I represent, Kooyong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that the government is introducing mandatory industry codes for scam protection and detection and victim support and redress by banks, telcos and digital platforms. The government claims that, under this legislation, scam victims will have a straightforward path to securing compensation after a single complaint, even when their complaint involves multiple companies. The liability will theoretically be shared between the sending and receiving banks, the digital platform and the telco provider, depending on the scam. The first sectors to be designated under the Scams Prevention Framework will be banks, telecommunication providers and providers of digital platform services relating to social media, paid search engine advertising and direct messaging. Other sectors will be considered in time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the legislation, banks will need confirmation-of-payee technology so that customers can check account names and other details to ensure that they're paying their money into the right bank account, and they will receive a warning if those details do not match. The Australian Banking Association says that this could be in place for all banks within 2025, although it is unclear why we can't have it immediately. After being informed of a scam, banks will have to report it to the authorities, and they will have to respond quickly, such as by stopping payments going through. They will be required to identify and shut down money mule accounts used to receive and shift scam victims' money, usually offshore. We know that failure to do this has been a failure of many banks for some years. I've had a number of constituents contact me with horror stories related to our big and small banks, their willingness to transfer money too quickly, their inability to recover losses after the fact and the challenges of dealing with their networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This framework also covers telecommunication providers, telcos, who are required to ascertain who is sending text messages. They're required to block numbers making scam calls. It also applies to the digital platform service providers. Scam victims will be able to seek compensation from digital platforms and from telcos, as well as the sending and receiving banks. But they will have to do that by taking their case to the ombudsman, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, or AFCA. In doing so, they can theoretically take a single action against multiple parties—banks, telcos and digital platforms—depending on the scam. The current maximal payout for a scam to be received by a consumer from AFCA is about $1.2 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will oversee enforcement of this framework. Companies failing to meet their obligations face massive fines of up to $50 million, and they could be forced to compensate victims. The legislation provides for criminal and civil penalties if the legislation is breached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very disappointing that the government has decided not to go ahead with the recommendation from experts and consumer groups that we follow the United Kingdom's approach of making banks primarily responsible for dispute resolution relating to scams. Since 2019, the United Kingdom has had a voluntary reimbursement model in place, which has recently become compulsory. Under the scheme, victims are protected, while the industry has a financial incentive to improve its scam protection systems. Australian banks have claimed this approach would make us a honey pot for scammers, but that claim has been rejected by the UK regulator and by some banks. Nine senior consumer groups, including the Consumer Action Law Centre, CHOICE, the Financial Rights Legal Centre and Financial Counselling Australia, have repeatedly called for the Albanese government to adopt a modified version of the UK reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed Scams Protection Framework is well intentioned and is a step in the right direction, but it falls down on this question of dispute resolution, which is, after all, the touchstone of protection from scams. The legislation sets up an unnecessarily complex multiparty case-by-case dispute resolution system. It would likely incentivise the industry to enforce a minimum standard compliance approach to obligations. It places the onus on scam victims to prove, presumably on the balance of probabilities, that the bank, the platforms and/or the telcos involved failed to meet their subjective and quite broad obligations under the Scams Protection Framework principles and codes, that the business's failure was the cause of the scam and that the scammer intended to deceive the victim. The problem is that, in many cases, the consumer has no access to the information required to prove the case. Banks refuse to hand over information at this point. Meta won't hand over its algorithms, and banks often won't release commercial-in-confidence data and systems. Given this information asymmetry, the task will likely be onerous and challenging for many individuals, especially older Australians and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumer advocacy groups say the process will include a person reporting the scam, lodging a complaint with the companies involved, seeking advice, escalating the dispute to AFCA, participating in meetings and then getting an outcome—a process which could involve as many as 30 steps and take as long as two years. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman agrees; she says it is not reasonable that consumers have to jump through all those hoops while watching regulated entities blame each other for their failings. It's also unclear how apportionment could work in this context. There could well be protracted arguments, even litigation, between banks, telcos and digital platforms about which entity caused the loss and who is responsible for how much of the liability—all while the victim waits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take a toll scam. A consumer receives an SMS saying they have an overdue toll. The consumer thinks it's genuine because they travelled on a toll road two days before. They hit the link in the message and get scammed. Who's at fault? Is it the bank? Is it the telco? Is it the tolling company who sold the consumer's travel data through real-time bidding? Or is it the data broker? How is an individual to work through this issue? The reality is that, in most cases, they won't; they'll drop the issue and pay the money, and the scammer will continue unpunished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, without a presumption of reimbursement, there is no economic incentive for banks to improve their systems to prevent scams. A change to the Scams Protection Framework to introduce a presumption of reimbursement, within limits, would help the framework meet its stated objectives. It would significantly ease the burden on consumers by removing the onus to prosecute their case against multiple multinational corporations over what would likely be years-long disputes. Enabling faster reimbursements for scams victims would incentivise much more investment in scams protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Consumer Action Law Centre and other expert groups have suggested an alternative model—a modified reimbursement framework which would lead the world on scams disruption and responses. This would be predicated on a presumption of bank reimbursement. In the model, the consumer would provide reasonable information to the bank. The bank would have five to 10 days to respond, and, in most cases, would then reimburse the scam victim. There would be limits to the presumption of reimbursement; for example, it would not be instituted where there is evidence of gross negligence or where a person knowingly took part in fraud. There would also be a backup option of a single-door external dispute resolution by AFCA where reimbursement is denied. The banks, telcos and digital platforms would then undertake apportionment after the consumer is reimbursed. That apportionment would be business to business at an industry level between SPF entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The model would create an incentive to drive industry action to innovate and invest in the technology and systems required to prevent scams. It would reduce the scam complaints process from as much as two years under the framework proposed in this bill to just a few weeks, with consumers, government regulators, dispute resolution bodies and businesses all set to benefit from the efficiency gained and the reduction in costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This country urgently needs a robust, well-enforced framework of consumer protections. For far too long, too many Australians have lost life-changing sums of money to scammers. For far too long, the businesses enabling scammers to conduct their activities have faced no consequences, leaving consumers to carry the burden of those crimes. It's a simple premise: consumers should be able to get their money back when businesses fail to protect them from scams. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This framework is well intentioned. It sets the scene for meaningful protection from scams. But it provides only half of the picture. We could do much better. Firstly, the government's SMS sender ID registry should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Secondly, the government should reverse the onus of proof for scams restitution—to institutions and away from individuals. Only by doing so can we maximise consumer protections and the incentives for institutions to improve their systems to stop scams and protect Australians from financial harm.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  This piece of legislation, the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024, is going to be very welcome in my electorate. I've held a number of scams forums over the last few years, in Wheelers Hill, Burwood, Glen Waverley, Mount Waverley and suburbs beyond, and they've been incredibly well attended events because there is huge community anxiety about the proliferation of scams. There is also a real sense of relief that our government is taking steps to crack down on scammers. My office has given out countless copies of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Little</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Book </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f Scams</span>, and I'll use this opportunity in the parliament to remind my constituents that they can contact our office at any time to receive their free copy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government have taken really seriously the responsibility to crack down on scammers. We made a promise ahead of the last election to protect the community from scammers, and, since being elected, our government have committed over $180 million to combat scams and online fraud. So far, there have been really positive signs from our efforts to combat scams. Yet, unfortunately, scam losses do remain unacceptably high. In 2023, scammers stole $2.7 billion from Australians, and scammers continue to cause real psychological and emotional harm to victims and their families. I'm sure most members in this place have had the experience of sitting with, speaking to and listening to constituents who have unfortunately fallen victim to scammers. Scammers are very sophisticated in the way they operate, and anyone can be a victim of their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current scam protections are piecemeal and inconsistent across the economy and, therefore, consumers face inconsistent protections and responses from different industries and providers. The Scams Prevention Framework being introduced in this bill is world-leading legislation and a central part of our broader consumer protection agenda, which is economy-wide reform—moving away from that inconsistency that we've seen. This economy-wide reform is designed to protect consumers from scams by requiring the private sector to adhere to consistent principles based obligations and strong tailored industry codes which are enforceable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consistent and enforceable approach of the Scams Prevention Framework will ensure that incentives and obligations are in place across key sectors that scammers take advantage of to cause deep harm in the community. The Scams Prevention Framework will ensure that all parts of the ecosystem used by scammers are equally held to account for implementing strong and effective protections that are tailored to that sector's role in the conduct of a scam. This is essential for the protection of consumers, as it's common for scammers to use multiple platforms and services to deceive and steal from people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulated entities will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent, detect, report, disrupt and respond to scams and to have governance arrangements in place relating to how entities will protect consumers from scams. Mandatory sector-specific codes will provide tailored prescriptive obligations to each sector which are consistent with the principles; however, the sector-specific codes do not relieve a business from its obligations to take reasonable steps in all circumstances. Recognising that scams are constantly evolving, businesses must be evolving in their response as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks, telecommunication providers and certain digital platforms offering social media, paid search advertising and direct messaging services will initially be designated under the Scams Prevention Framework, as they represent key factors of harm for consumers. Bank transfer was the most reported payment method used by scammers, with $212.9 million in reported losses in 2023, according to Scamwatch. Phone calls and social media were the contact methods associated with the highest value of losses. In 2023, these losses were $116 million for phone calls and $93.5 million for social media contact. Again, this information comes from Scamwatch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as a sidenote, Scamwatch is a really important way for the government to keep track of scammers' activity. I myself have made complaints and reports to Scamwatch when scammers have attempted to trick me, so I encourage people to put a report through to Scamwatch when they are contacted by scammers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other sectors, such as superannuation, cryptocurrency, online marketplaces and other payment providers, may be designated under the Scams Prevention Framework in the future. A multiregulator model involving the ACCC as the regulator for the principle based obligations and the ACCC, ASIC and ACMA as regulators for the sector-specific codes capitalises on existing industry knowledge and expertise. This is really important. This will ensure that no single regulator will be spread too thinly as the Scams Prevention Framework expands to additional sectors as scam activity shifts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulators have access to significant civil penalties of up to $50 million for the most egregious breaches of the Scams Prevention Framework. This is intended to incentivise compliance and provide adequate penalties to deter regulated entities, who may foresee high possible gains, from breaching the Scams Prevention Framework. Regulators will have other compliance tools available, such as infringement notices, enforceable undertakings, injunctions, public warnings and remedial directions, to ensure that the Scams Prevention Framework is administered as intended to protect consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, consumers will have access to free and transparent dispute resolution processes if they are the victim of a scam and one or more regulated entities has not met its obligations. Regulated entities must have an internal dispute resolution process in place and become a member of a designated external dispute resolution scheme. With a no-wrong-door approach to internal dispute processes, consumers will be able to approach any regulated entity connected to the scam they've experienced to raise a dispute. It is really important, too, that no-one is turned away when they make that initial step to raise a dispute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have already announced our intention to authorise the Australian Financial Complaints Authority as the external dispute resolution scheme for the three initial sectors. This single-door approach means consumers will have to go to only one body to escalate their scam complaint, even where it may involve multiple regulated entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened so far to some of the speeches that have raised the question of a mandatory presumption of reimbursement approach, such as the one the UK has in place. Our government has decided not to take that approach, because we want to incentivise actions to address scam activity across the entire scam activity chain, not leave some sectors with lower expectations and lower responsibilities in relation to their liability. Placing liability simply on banks alone fails to recognise and hold to account the entities that have many opportunities to stop a scam before the harm to the consumer is caused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will consult on the Scams Prevention Framework dispute resolution model to ensure that alternative dispute resolution operates effectively. Consumers of course should be able to rely on protections and raise their complaints with all regulated businesses under consistent expectations of how they will be treated. Consumers will also be able to take action in court where they have suffered loss or damage because a regulated entity has not met its obligations under the Scams Prevention Framework. As with the intention for external dispute resolution, liabilities for loss or damage where more than one regulated entity has not met obligations can be apportioned between multiple regulated entities. Again, this is about ensuring we recognise the scam activity chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scams are a global challenge. The Assistant Treasurer's attendance at the inaugural Global Fraud Summit, in the UK in March of last year, really reiterated the important role and influence of Australia and of our government in fighting scams within the international community. This legislation will support our government's efforts and industry's efforts in international engagement and collaboration, including by enabling the sharing of scam intelligence across regulated entities, law enforcement and regulators in Australia and, importantly, by supporting international enforcement action to disrupt illicit scam activities, as, of course, this is a global challenge and we are often engaging with global operators here in the scam activity space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this is really welcomed by my community in Chisholm. People frankly have had enough of being targeted by scammers, and it seems to come sometimes from all directions, as we've described in our comments—the government's contribution. This is something that people are experiencing on social media, via phone calls and via emails. I'm really proud to be part of a government that is taking serious action to protect our communities from the despicable actions of scammers, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  Scams don't just rob Australians of their money; they rob Australians of their peace of mind, trust and dignity. Being the victim of a scam can be a devastating experience that ripples through families and communities, creating untold suffering and leaving immense damage in its wake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country has become a honey pot for scams. Last year alone, a staggering $2.7 billion was stolen from Australians by scammers. Small businesses remain particularly vulnerable to scams, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission highlighting that small and micro businesses lost over $13.7 million to payment redirection scams in 2022, a 95 per cent increase from the previous year, constituting a significant proportion of total business scam losses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These scams exploit digital vulnerabilities, leaving businesses exposed to financial and operational risks. This is an issue that requires urgent attention and a solution that will protect all Australians from the scourge of scams. This is a transnational criminal industry that extends far beyond our borders, and it requires an immediate and effective response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastating consequences of scams cannot be understated. I hear stories about scams all the time in my own electorate. I'm especially haunted by one story. It's about a man in his 70s, an immigrant, who came to Australia decades ago and built a life here and then was caught in a series of scams that took nearly everything he had. He had saved for his family and for his children and grandchildren, but over time, as he found himself widowed and living alone and vulnerable, he fell prey to a series of calls that seemed so convincing. They promised him higher returns, security for his future and companionship. He trusted them, and in return he was stripped of his life savings. Now, at nearly 80, he is contemplating finding a job because his retirement has been stolen. This isn't an isolated story; it's a shared experience for countless Australians, and that's why we're here today, discussing the proposed Scams Prevention Framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024 takes steps towards fortifying Australia's defences against a very real and escalating threat. However, it doesn't do enough. We must be honest about this bill's shortcomings, because, as it stands, it risks burdening the very people we're trying to protect. One of my key concerns is the onus reversal that this bill proposes. Under this bill, victims not only are left to pick up the pieces but are also expected to prove that the financial institutions or platforms they trusted failed them. They must somehow gather evidence to make a case against companies that have teams of lawyers and access to all the data they themselves lack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to an ACCC report from April last year, it's older people who suffer the greatest harm at the hands of scammers. Losses for people over the age of 65 increased by 13.3 per cent in 2023 to $120 million in 2024. Imagine an elderly woman who has recently experienced a devastating financial blow because of a scam. Her hard-earned savings have vanished due to sophisticated fraud, leaving her overwhelmed with the daunting task of proving what went wrong. She now faces not only emotional turmoil but also a taxing and arduous process of proving that her bank didn't take the proper steps to protect her. This process is unfair. As it stands, this bill shifts that burden onto individual victims, asking too much of those who are already struggling. The reversal of the burden of proof creates a stacked deck where corporations are shielded behind technical jargon and internal policies that consumers aren't even allowed to see. It creates a barrier that favours those with resources and penalises ordinary Australians, who are often isolated and unable to navigate such a complex process alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pressing issue is the lack of a clear, consumer focused timeline for resolving disputes. Currently, people who have been scammed can face months or even years trying to get answers. They're left in limbo, often with financial stress that compounds their trauma. We should be putting in place a clear, timely process that allows scam victims to find redress quickly, not landing them in a bureaucratic maze. We should look closely at the UK, where they've established a clear presumption of reimbursement for scam victims. The UK model starts with a simple idea: consumers who've been scammed will be reimbursed if the institution fails to prove it took every reasonable action to protect them. This approach not only aligns with models proposed by experts but represents a critical shift in the pervasive victim-blaming dynamic that often underpins the response to scams. In the case of the UK, placing the onus back onto the institutions that control the systems that facilitate scams and away from consumers who simply don't have the resources or information to prove negligence has proven to be an effective model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the UK Payment Systems Regulator's June 2024 report, victims of scams in the UK were reimbursed for 67 per cent of their losses in 2023, with that figure expected to rise to 95 per cent under a mandatory model. In stark contrast, Australian banks reimbursed only two to seven per cent of scam losses in 2023. By holding institutions responsible, unless they can demonstrate proactive and reasonable scam prevention measures, the model has led to a shift in industry practices, with banks investing more in antifraud technologies and strategies. The focus on institutional responsibility not only improves consumer protections but also reduces the overall impact of scams, as institutions have stronger incentives to prevent fraud before it occurs. This model drives accountability and delivers real, positive outcomes for victims by ensuring that those with the power to prevent scams are fully responsible for doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data shows that a model like this is effective not only in delivering compensation to victims but in driving long-term improvements in scam prevention. Presumption of reimbursement provisions exist in laws addressing power imbalances and information asymmetry, which is especially true in the case of scams. Experience tells us that, if we don't hold companies accountable, they will likely do the bare minimum, and it's Australians who will pay the price. As it stands, this bill doesn't do enough to drive real, proactive protections across banking, social media and telecommunications companies, and this is what needs to change. We need to shift the responsibility from individuals to institutions. We must hold banks and platforms accountable for protecting Australians, not ask people to justify why they deserve redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we must compel companies to formally acknowledge their obligations under the Scams Prevention Framework. The proposed amendments put forward by my crossbench colleagues mandate the public disclosure of prevention efforts, require companies to provide a statement of compliance and ensure special protections for vulnerable consumers. These will strengthen the bill's effectiveness, addressing some of the flaws I have outlined today. Mandating public disclosures of scam prevention efforts will help shine a light on industry practices, ensuring companies do more than just meet the bare minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mackellar has introduced a 'vulnerable consumer' definition, which will enhance protections for consumers who are particularly susceptible to scams, including elderly people, non-English speakers and people with disabilities. The member for Wentworth's amendment requires regulated entities to publicly disclose information about the scams they detect and respond to. Under this provision, entities involved in scam prevention must publish quarterly scam reports, with civil penalties imposed on those that fail to comply. Enshrining special protections for vulnerable Australians and measures to increase public accountability and transparency must be included in the primary legislation. These critical additions will ensure scam victims are not left in the dark when trying to seek redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, the amendment being moved by the member for Warringah introduces a statement-of-compliance requirement, a particularly crucial step in protecting small businesses and Australians from scams by increasing transparency and accountability. Financial institutions and digital platforms handling scam complaints will be required to formally demonstrate compliance with their obligations through a written statement, ensuring businesses are not left in the dark when seeking redress. Failure to provide this statement will be a civil penalty provision, making institutions more accountable while also strengthening small businesses' legal ability to unfair denials of reimbursement. Additionally, these statements will be admissible in external dispute resolution, giving Australians and small-business owners a stronger foundation to recover losses. This is a crucial addition and a necessary first step in safeguarding the businesses that sustain our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I am concerned that this bill lacks an explicit focus on mental health and wellbeing, leaving a critical gap in its approach to addressing the full impact of scams on individuals. Scams inflict more than just financial wounds. They cause extreme stress, anxiety and other mental health issues, especially for those who may already be vulnerable and marginalised. The absence of a mental health lens in this legislation overlooks the compounded effects of scams on victims, who often experience ongoing distress and psychological harm. While this bill offers avenues for consumer redress through internal and external dispute resolution mechanisms, it stops short in the critical area where it must bare its teeth. My criticism of this bill is informed by extensive consultation with experts, by the experiences of victims in my electorate who come to my office in Goldstein desperate for help and by the clear lessons we can draw from successful models overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, while this bill is far from perfect, Australians simply cannot afford to wait any longer for some protections against scams that are escalating in scale, sophistication and devastation. I am inclined, for that reason, to support this iteration of the bill, but it is clear that this legislation alone is not enough. We must ensure this framework is backed by enforceable, sector specific codes that create real accountability. While this bill lays the legal foundation for scam prevention, the second phase—implementing mandatory industry codes—is essential to establishing clear, enforceable standards across banking, telecommunications and digital platforms. Without these codes, we risk a fragmented approach that leaves consumers vulnerable. These codes must be binding to ensure consistency in internal dispute resolution processes across banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms. I will continue to advocate for a robust scams prevention framework, one that holds industries to account, provides clarity for consumers and prioritises fair and timely outcomes for scam victims. This is unfinished business. The financial and emotional toll of scams is too great for us to take half-measures. We must get this right. We have the chance to do better for Australians—to create a system that doesn't leave people fighting impossible battles on their own.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  Fighting scams has been one of my personal priorities since I came to this place. I've got the privilege of serving on the House Economics Committee, and, through public inquiries, I've pushed for stronger protections for scam victims and demanded greater accountability from banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms. In my time here, I've questioned the big banks directly on their inconsistent responses to scams and raised the need for a coordinated approach to tackle these crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I sat down to write this speech, it made me reflect on the experiences that people in my electorate have shared and how they will be personally impacted by this legislation. I want to share two stories with you. Amy from North Epping contacted my office after losing over $1,000 in what she thought was a safe transaction through a social media chat group. She acted quickly, filing a police report and notifying her bank within an hour, but was told that the recovery of her funds was unlikely. She expressed her frustration with the 10-day investigation period and the lack of immediate measures to halt fraudulent transfers. Then there's Sonny, who trusted a professional-looking offer to transfer over $80,000 into what he thought was a high-interest account at an established bank. Everything about the scam seemed legitimate, from the paperwork to the communication. It wasn't until he realised the fraud that he discovered the money was gone. Despite reporting his case to the bank and to the police, his funds remain unrecovered and he's left with no clear path forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is for people like Amy and Sonny. It's for the Australians who have been let down by gaps in our system and who deserve better. It's for the communities, families and individuals who expect the government to do something to keep their money safe. There are thousands upon thousands of Australians who have played by the rules, who trusted the systems that they relied on and still found themselves targeted by sophisticated criminals. It's not just their financial stability that's shaken; it's their confidence, their peace of mind and, in many cases, their relationships with their family and friends and with the institutions they thought would protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023 alone, Australians lost $2.7 billion to scams. Behind every dollar stolen is a person, a family or a small business left to pick up the pieces. It's the retiree who loses their life savings through a fraudulent investment scheme. It's the small business owner unable to pay staff because they were tricked into sending lots of money to a fake supplier. It's the parent who thought they were securing their child's future, only to see their savings vanish. These are not hypothetical scenarios; they're real stories I've heard time and time again. These scams do not just take money; they take trust. They exploit the systems and institutions we all rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers, while staggering, only tell part of the story. Behind each dollar lost are people dealing with the emotional distress, shame and even mental health challenges that arise from being deceived. The retiree who sees their financial security evaporate overnight is left questioning their judgement and wondering how they will make ends meet. The small-business owner who transfers funds to a scammer is facing not just financial hardship but also the weight of their staff's livelihoods. And the family who loses their savings is forced to navigate the heartbreak of rebuilding what was meant to be a foundation for the next generation. Scams do not just take money; they take trust. It's very important that we restore that trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, the response to scams has been fragmented. Protections have varied across industries, and, while some sectors have taken steps to improve, others have lagged behind. This piecemeal approach has left Australians vulnerable and has created an environment where scammers can operate willy-nilly. The inconsistencies in how industries respond to scams mean that whether or not you are protected can depend more on luck than any systemic safeguard. This legislation changes that. The Scams Prevention Framework introduced in the bill is the first economy-wide reforms designed to tackle scams comprehensively. It ensures that every sector scammers exploit—that is, banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms—are all held to account equally. Under this framework, regulated entities will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent, detect, report, disrupt and respond to scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just about reacting to scams as they occur; it's about preventing them from happening in the first place. It's about strengthening the systems that scammers exploit, whether that's the SMS service used to send fraudulent messages or spoof centre IDs, the social media platforms used to post fake ads—and we've all seen them—or the banking systems used to move stolen money. This legislation ensures that all known areas are covered and that every player is equally responsible for protecting people's money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What sets this framework apart is its enforceability. Industries have for too long been able to shirk responsibility with little consequence for their inaction. This legislation ensures that regulators have the tools they need to enforce compliance. Civil penalties of up to $50 million will apply to the most egregious breaches, sending a clear message to everyone involved. Failing to protect consumers is not an option. For victims, this legislation provides clear pathways to seek redress. Regulated entities will be required to establish internal dispute resolution processes and participate in external schemes like the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Victims will not have to navigate a confusing maze of responsibilities; they will have a single, straightforward process to get the help they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation also recognises that scams do not happen in isolation. They involve multiple touch points: a fraudulent text message, a fake social media ad and that bank transfer. That's why this framework takes a holistic approach, requiring all sectors involved in the scam ecosystem to work together. Whether a telco blocks the scam call, a social media platform removes the fake ad or a bank stops a suspicious transfer, every part of the system has a role to play. This collaborative approach is essential because scammers don't respect boundaries between industries—they actually exploit them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some, like the member for Goldstein, have argued for a mandatory reimbursement model like the one in the UK, where only the banks are required to compensate victims of scams. Where this legislation is better is that it puts all those involved on the hook. Scams don't start and end just with banks; they begin with fraudulent messages and deceptive advertising. Focusing solely on banks ignores the critical role that the telecommunication sector and the social media sector play in perpetrating scams and also the role they need to play in preventing scams. This legislation deliberately takes a broader view, and that idea of shared responsibility underpins the framework. The banks will have to monitor suspicious transfers and strengthen their fraud detection systems, telecommunications providers must take proactive measures to block scam messages and calls, and digital platforms must crackdown on the spread of fake ads and fraudulent schemes. These are not optional actions—they are the fundamental obligations of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to take scams seriously, and we've done that since coming to government. Since we've come to government we've opened the National Anti-Scam Centre and we've seen the first sustained reduction in scam losses in years—a 43 per cent decrease in scam losses in the final quarter of 2023 compared to the same period the year before. These results are promising, but they are just the beginning. This Scams Prevention Framework builds on these early successes, ensuring that we have the tools to continue driving down scam losses and protecting Australians. We're sending a message to these criminals: 'Australia is not the place to conduct your illegal business.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is also forward-looking. It recognises that scammers are constantly adapting their methods, exploiting new technologies and finding new ways to deceive. That's why this framework allows for other sectors, such as cryptocurrency platforms and online marketplaces, to be brought under its umbrella in the future. It ensures we can respond to emerging threats and stay one step ahead of the scammers. Cryptocurrency scams, for example, have become a significant concern. Australians have lost millions of dollars to fraudulent schemes involving digital currencies, which are often promoted through social media ads that, once again, appear legitimate. These scams exploit the excitement and confusion surrounding new technologies, making them particularly dangerous. By including provisions to expand the framework as needed, the legislation ensures we can address emerging threats without delay. The futureproof nature of the legislation is critical in an era when scammers are always evolving. By creating a flexible framework that can adapt to include new sectors, it ensures a future government will not be caught off guard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd encourage all those who listen to this speech or read it at a later time to compare our approach to scams of that of the former government. Not much happened under the Liberals with regard to scams. Their approach was essentially to say to victims that they were on their own—that they should have been smarter, done better or not fallen victim to the work of sophisticated criminals. Well, that's not our approach. Where we see a need to help Australians and keep their money safe, we'll step in. This legislation shows that we're listening to Aussies who have asked us to protect them from criminals and to help them protect their money. This legislation is about keeping Australians safe by ensuring the money they earn is protected from criminals and that, if they still fall foul of it, there are open and transparent rules on how to recoup lost money in circumstances that are outlined in this bill. To help people do that, extra funding has also been provided to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority to bolster their methods to help Australians recover lost funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that scams aren't just an Australian problem; they're a global challenge. Criminal networks operate across borders, targeting victims worldwide. What we need to do is make sure that Australia is no longer a soft target for these criminals to exploit our most vulnerable Australians. This legislation positions Australia as a leader in the international fight against scams. It supports intelligence-sharing between regulators, law enforcement and industry both here and overseas. It will ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of global efforts to disrupt scam models as they pop up across the world. At a global fraud summit earlier this year, Australia's approach was highlighted as a model for effective action. It builds on that recognition, ensuring that we continue to lead the way in protecting Australians. This legislation ultimately is about fairness. It's about ensuring the burden of scams doesn't fall solely on victims, and it's about making sure that every industry that profits from the digital economy also takes social responsibility to protect it. It's about holding everyone in the scam ecosystem accountable for their roles in preventing and responding to these crimes. Yes, banks should be held accountable, but telecommunications companies and, importantly, the companies behind social media, where most scams begin and end, absolutely have to step up, be part of this legislation and be held responsible by it. Here, we want to ensure we stand up for everyone's right to feel safe online, to trust the systems they rely on and to keep the money they've worked so hard to earn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Last month I had the pleasure of visiting the Fireside Crafters, a group of women who meet every Wednesday at Steels Creek Community Centre. The group started in the aftermath of the Black Saturday bushfires as a place for women to find social connection and take their minds off the devastation. Some had lost everything. It was great to meet founding member Barbara as well as president Debbie, secretary Cheryl and treasurer Carol and hear about the many quilts that they have made for patients in the palliative care unit at Healesville Hospital. The group also make clothing items for organisations like HICCI and give them to local police to pass on to those experiencing homelessness. The Fireside Crafters are a great example of the community spirit we have in Casey. They've turned the devastation of Black Saturday into this group, which continues to have a positive impact almost 16 years on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In being out in the community on Australia Day, the thing that stood out to me most was that our community is tied together by our amazing volunteer spirit. My day began at the Monbulk Rotary and Wandin Rotary Australia Day breakfasts. Congratulations to Dr Dan, who was recognised with a community award for his contribution to local health care, and to Georgia Knight, a former Monbulk Football Club member, who received a youth award after being drafted to the Collingwood AFLW team. Go Pies! Thank you to the Rotarians and volunteers who organised these events.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then went on to a citizenship ceremony to welcome 46 new citizens, from 21 countries, at the Yarra Ranges Council citizenship ceremony. On Australia Day it was an honour to present the 2025 Citizen of the Year Award to Maureen of Millgrove Residents Action Group. Maureen is a cornerstone of the community in Millgrove who has volunteered for more than five decades.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the Community Group of the Year, Holy Fools. It was wonderful to see Neal and the team recognised for their work supporting people experiencing homelessness in the Yarra Ranges.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also great to see Debbie from Candlebark Community Nursery honoured with the Environmental Achiever of the Year Award, and Jarvis named Young Citizen of the Year. And congratulations to Eddie Tichelaar, who does amazing things for Montrose, including through Montrose CFA and the Montrose Township Group, on receiving the Ian De La Rue Award for Community Leadership. We were very lucky to have Ian's wife, Margaret, there to present the award in his honour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor's Lifetime Achievement Award went to both Sue Thompson and Harry Moyle. Sue has an unwavering commitment to local history through her work with the Lilydale &amp; District Historical Society, and Harry has been a longstanding volunteer of Caladenia Dementia Care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day, I had the honour of visiting Coldstream Fire Brigade with my state colleague Bridget Vallence to unveil the name of their pumper in honour of Robert Bethell. Robert has been a CFA volunteer for 63 years, including 23 years as Coldstream's captain. His and his family's contribution is significant, with his son Sean now the captain of the Coldstream CFA.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was special on that day to see life membership of the Coldstream CFA awarded to the late David McClellan. David was a volunteer at the brigade, and it was a bittersweet and proud moment for his wife and family, who were there on the day. He is deeply missed at Coldstream CFA and in the wider Casey community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations also to volunteers Julie and Steve, who received special service awards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic to end the day at the RDCA's Emergency Services Cup to raise funds for the CFA and the SES. Congratulations to the women's SES team and the men's CFA teams who took home the trophies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a fantastic Australia Day in our community that shone a spotlight on the amazing volunteer spirit we have both in Casey and across the nation. It was great to see so many people celebrate and share our love of Australia.</span>

I remember that before the last election, before the honourable member for Bennelong joined us in this house of democracy, I joined a whole range of nurses at the ANMF in Victoria, where the Leader of the Opposition at the time, now the Prime Minister, announced that we were going to establish 50 urgent care clinics around the country. This was going to mean that there would be walk-in centres. You wouldn't have had to make an appointment; all you would have had to do is walk in and bring your Medicare card, and you would have been able to see a doctor. You don't need your credit card, as the Leader of the Opposition wanted when he wanted to put a GP tax on every single family who wanted to go and see their doctor. All we wanted was for you to bring your Medicare card, and we would make sure that a doctor, a GP—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                  </a>  I've got an interjection from the honourable member for Fisher about how that's working for us. It is working so well, Member for Fisher. If you go to the urgent care clinic next to the Alfred in my electorate, you will see people utilising that service and the hardworking nurses and doctors treating the people of my community with the best possible medical care our country has to offer. They are right across from the Alfred if they need it, and they can get further access to the public health care they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a system that is making a difference not only to families and people who need to access a GP clinic but to people who are working in emergency departments, which are under huge strain and huge stress. We've got an emergency physician amongst our ranks in the member for Robertson. He understands how difficult it is and how many pressures there are on our emergency departments, and the urgent care clinics, including the one we set up in my electorate next to the Alfred hospital, do an outstanding job. If those opposite want to shut down the urgent care clinics, just as they tried to make every single Australian pay to see a doctor, then that's something they should be honest about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite have said, and the Leader of the Opposition said on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders </span>over the weekend, that they are going to cut the Public Service and they are going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars. We know what that means. Last time it meant indexation on university places; we know that Joe Hockey came into this place and tried to introduce constant indexation on university places. We know it meant a complete gutting of services. We know those opposite, under the then health minister, the Leader of the Opposition, tried to put a GP tax on every time you went to the doctor. That has not been our approach. Labor believes in Medicare and making sure we increase access to Medicare services around the country. We know how difficult it is for GP clinics and GPs around the country. It is a really important profession. I have family members who have been GPs for decades; they do an outstanding job servicing our community. We could not be prouder of our GPs, but we know it is getting harder to be a GP in Australia. That is why our policy is around ensuring each and every Australian can have access to Medicare services and to the outstanding medical professionals we have here in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not the only thing in the healthcare space that we have delivered in my electorate in the first term. I was absolutely delighted to walk into our brand-new headspace in South Melbourne, which is there to support young people who need access to that vital mental health care. You only have to talk to the staff who work in that South Melbourne clinic to know that the young people who will come in for free and access those services, in the same way people access those urgent care services, will be able to access outstanding mental health support services for whatever they are going through. In Dorcas Street in South Melbourne, we have such an amazing array of different communities. South Melbourne is such an incredibly beautiful and diverse part of Melbourne. But we know mental health doesn't discriminate between those who have a lot of resources and those who don't, and this service and this clinic will be there to support the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Australians like these that I encouraged new citizens to emulate at our two Australian citizenship ceremonies in Maleny and Buddina on Australia Day. I tasked nearly 100 new citizens with embracing the rights and privileges of Australian citizenship while shouldering the responsibility to vote, serve and uphold our values. Congratulations to Mooloolaba Rotary and the Maleny District Sport and Recreation Club for hosting both ceremonies, and a big shout-out goes to Clif Hefner and Theresa Craig for their great work in the Maleny citizenship ceremony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate the people of Montville and Maleny, which this week were declared the most welcoming places in Australia in the 2025 Traveller Review Awards, based on more than 360 million traveller reviews. As a Mooloolah Valley local, I know well that our hinterland communities are some of the best places in which to live, work and raise a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Montville local, Sam Lucas, is certainly doing his community proud as he takes on the concert halls of Europe with his cello. Young Sam has invested a tremendous amount of dedication to master his craft, and those calloused fingers and long hours have now translated into a remarkable global career. Just two weeks ago, Sam was asked to perform at the European Parliament as part of global commemorations of the liberation of Auschwitz. Sam performed on a long-lost Gagliano cello, crafted in 1720. That cello belong to renowned musician Pal Hermann. Mr Hermann was one of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, making Sam's performance all the more poignant. I want to thank Richard Bruinsma, another constituent of mine, for sharing Sam's story with me recently, and I want to congratulate Sam on his ongoing success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member for Fisher, I, like just about all members that stand in this place, am very proud of my community. All members who come in here are proud of their own communities, but Fisher is home to an incredible number of community groups and inspiring individuals who work hard to get Fisher active, to combat loneliness, to boost health outcomes and to keep Australians safe. They say that the Sunshine Coast is a community of communities. We don't have one big city centre. We've got lots and lots of small townships, and, having recently moved from the coast back into the hinterland, I've got to tell you that going back to Mooloolah Valley, back to the bush, is like coming home. That small-town community spirit—you just can't beat it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's tedious red tape and reporting requirements, its skyrocketing costs and its savage cuts to community funding programs have all resulted in the decline of volunteering. So many different community groups, I know, are just not getting the same number of volunteers coming through the door, and it's greatly as a result of the red tape and the cost of living that this government is bringing down on everyday Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  The northern suburbs of Adelaide are some of the fastest growing areas of the country. There are large-scale developments in the north coming to fruition now, like Riverlea, Eyre and new parts of Virginia. There are areas that are identified for substantial growth, like Concordia, and there are multiple areas earmarked for new housing to be built through the transport corridor in Elizabeth, Munno Para and Salisbury in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But with that growth there naturally comes demand from the increased population, and for this growth to be sustained appropriately that demand needs to be met adequately. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case in the north. One example of this, which I've already spoken about in this place, is in road infrastructure. Although it is a local government road, we've seen Curtis Road, in particular, fail to meet the standard required to support the community that has gradually been built around it. As a result, it can be nigh on impossible to get on and off Curtis Road at peak times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, this stresses the importance of being ready for substantial population growth by ensuring that essential services and infrastructure are able to support our communities. This is an area that all governments must stay on top of, and it is an area that our Labor government is on top of. Through government programs like the urban Precincts and Partnerships Program, we're taking the steps needed to make sure local communities are ready not just to grow but to thrive when they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important areas where this federal Labor government has stepped in to accommodate growth in my community is in the space of health and wellbeing. I was immensely proud to be alongside the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in my electorate last week when she announced that the Albanese Labor government would be providing $26 million towards the construction of the brand-new family health and wellbeing hub in the Elizabeth Vale health precinct. In tandem with the Lyell McEwin Hospital and the existing local health network, this will provide invaluable support for families in need. The new hub comes as an extension of care services that are usually exclusive to the Adelaide CBD. Those essential care services include assets provided by the Women's and Children's Hospital, which has partnered with the federal government and other bodies to deliver the project. They include an allied health clinic to provide affordable health care to families, community spaces to bring people together through collective support, sleep rooms to support new parents and their babies, and other care services to ensure young families can mitigate potential challenges and stresses in order to secure their wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to this investment by the federal government and the overall partnership with counterparts at the state and federal levels, as well as third parties, those invaluable services are now on the doorstep of residents in my community, as they should be. Currently, to get the type of care offered by the new family and wellbeing hub, a family, who may be in challenging socioeconomic conditions, would have to get the 224 Adelaide Metro bus into the city or take a round trip of up to two hours along the Gawler line to reach the Women's and Children's Hospital in North Adelaide. Any parent can tell you how hard it is to get a pram on public transport and about the difficult preparation that's needed for what is a family day trip just to access essential care services. These families who have to travel these long distances, often multiple times a week, are coming from one of the fastest growing outer suburban areas in the country. These services should be closer to them, and they will be when this project is complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That long distance is also a situation that puts off families from attending those services. These are families that can be increasingly isolated from parental and family support services already, especially in our community. It's a fact that one in three of SA's most developmentally vulnerable five-year-olds live in the area this new hub will address. I've already noted on numerous occasions in this place just how entrenched lower socioeconomic outcomes can be for families in the north. Circuit breakers are needed, and this new health service is exactly that for our community. The new family and wellbeing hub in Elizabeth Vale will also serve to complement the new Medicare urgent care clinic, the Medicare mental health clinic and the soon to be opened headspace in Gawler, all established under this federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are Labor ensuring everyday Aussie communities like mine are meeting the needs of their growing populations; we are doing so in a way that will help transform the lives of those who reside in them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  As this may well be the last occasion on which I can give an adjournment debate speech in this parliament, I want to thank the electorate of Hughes for voting me in in 2022. I had six weeks and a profile that wasn't as well known as it could have been, and I am extremely grateful, because it has been the greatest privilege of my life to be able to represent and serve my community in the federal parliament. During this time, I think as we all do, we start to reflect. I had a redistribution in October, which has meant that I have lost some suburbs, such as Oyster Bay, Grays Point, Kirrawee and other parts that I have really enjoyed representing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, my electorate now stretches down into south-west Sydney. The south-west of Sydney really has been neglected for a long time by governments, state and federal and of both political persuasions. South-west Sydney is very different to Western Sydney, where I think we have invested very well. We have really looked after people in Western Sydney. In Western Sydney—in Penrith, for example—they have a beach. In my electorate now, in Macquarie Fields, an area that has a very high level of people with disabilities, we don't have an accessible lift at Macquarie Fields train station. That's a disgrace—an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went out to schools at the end of last year, as pretty much all the MPs I know in this place do, it was a great privilege for me to go to schools like Ingleburn High School, Macquarie Fields High School and Sackville Street Public School and hear the work that they're doing. For me, having grown up in the Sutherland Shire, the communities in the south-west are quite different to the Sutherland Shire, but I was absolutely overwhelmed at the fabulous work that they are doing out there. They have different challenges in the south-west of Sydney. For example, there are a lot of attendance awards given out in year 11 and year 12. That's not something that usually occurs down in the Sutherland Shire or the Liverpool end of my electorate, and I think it shows just how committed the teachers are in those areas, particularly those who are working in public education. I am very proudly a product of a public-school primary school and then a public-school high school. We need different priorities going forward for the south-west of Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a massive shout-out to the other parts of my electorate that have been very kind to me since I was elected and I feel have really embraced me. We have stood together and fought to save the koalas, for example. We have chlamydia-free koalas in Heathcote National Park and in the Royal National Park, and I have stood there with the Sutherland Shire Environment Centre and fought for fencing—fought the state government, both Liberal and Labor—to prevent these koalas crossing Heathcote Road and being killed. We have stood together on issues like getting more services for disability into the Sutherland Shire. Having sat on a board as a volunteer many years ago in disability services, I fully recognise how important that sector is not only for people with disabilities but, most importantly, for their families. I take this opportunity to say thank you to the electorate of Hughes. You will see a lot of me in the next few months. You've seen a lot of me already. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  We are so lucky to live in a country where we celebrate many events across many cultures, and from December to now we've had it all. Christmas rolled into New Year's and then, of course, Australia Day, and right now we are in the middle of lunar new year celebrations—all back to back, all a chance for friends and family to connect, and a time to reflect on and celebrate who we are and to dream about our future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Day was a special time in Bennelong. I was able to attend back-to-back citizenship ceremonies in Lane Cove and then West Ryde, where I was joined by Premier Minns. It is always such an honour to welcome hundreds of new citizens to our big Australian family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also, of course, a day to celebrate our great Australians. In Bennelong we had five amazing Aussies who received the Medal of the Order of Australia. Ms Carmen Platt OAM, from Marsfield, was recognised for her exceptional service to the community through charitable organisations. Gold medal winner in Paris Ms Olivia Wunsch OAM, from North Ryde, was recognised for her achievements in sport. Mr Romualdas Cibas and his wife, Mrs Maritsa Cibas, from Huntleys Cove, were recognised for their outstanding service to the Australian Lithuanian community. Then we have Ms Penelope Margaret Gerstle OAM, from Northwood. She was honoured for her significant service to human rights, community health and people with disabilities. Mr James Rodgers OAM, of Lane Cove, was recognised for his service to primary and secondary education and to cricket. Special mentions also go to Mr David Archer ACM, from West Ryde, who was awarded the Australian Corrections Medal; and Mr Bernard Carlon PSM, from Denison East, who was awarded the Public Service Medal for his exceptional contributions to road safety and sustainability in New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, as mentioned, right after Australia Day we went straight into lunar new year celebrations. The Year of the Snake is upon us, the snake a symbol of wisdom, resilience and transformation. I'm honoured to share the joy and significance of these festivals with the House today. Lunar new year is a time of family, renewal and community, and this year was no exception. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of attending several events showcasing our local area's vibrancy and diversity. At the Chatswood Year of the Snake Festival, thousands gathered to enjoy traditional performances, lion dances and cultural showcases that highlight the deep roots of our Asian Australian communities. At the Eastwood night markets lunar new year celebrations, we witnessed firsthand the strength of a multicultural society as people of all backgrounds came together to enjoy delicious food and entertainment, all while supporting our local business owners, who set up their markets to mark this special occasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also hosted my annual Bennelong multicultural leaders lunch, where local leaders came together to celebrate the new year, reflect on the contribution of our local Korean and Chinese Australian communities and discuss the importance of fostering a more inclusive and united future. To top it all off, I had the privilege of welcoming the foreign minister to Bennelong on Sunday for a street walk and handing out, of course, red packets to the local community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the celebrations aren't over yet. On Saturday 8 February, we'll continue the lunar new year festivities at the City of Ryde's lunar new year celebration in Eastwood, on Eastwood oval. It's always a highlight on the local calendar, bringing together thousands of people to enjoy cultural performances, market stalls, traditional food, the best lion dance you will ever see and fireworks at the end. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly celebrate lunar new year every year, and I know more and more people in Bennelong, regardless of their background, are celebrating events like these together. Back home, restaurants are full, people are catching up and our town centres are buzzing. This makes me happy, and it makes me so proud to be an Australian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our multiculturalism is a defining pillar of who we are. It's in our country's DNA. Our diverse communities and the way we celebrate one another's cultures and traditions do not weaken us; they strengthen us. Our multiculturalism enriches our lives, it makes our economy dynamic and it brings people together. Whether you're celebrating lunar new year, Diwali, Eid, Hanukkah, Nowruz, Christmas, Easter or Australia Day, these are all celebrations that do not compete with each other; they complement one another and they reflect the breadth and depth of our shared national identity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024. In 2023, Australians lost $2.7 billion to scams. That's an enormous amount of money stolen from families already doing it tough, community groups making their neighbourhoods better places and local businesses just trying to get by. While recent data shows that total losses dipped in 2023, the reality remains that scams are still happening and that Australia is a key target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a person is scammed, they don't just suffer a financial loss. Scam victims often experience significant emotional and psychological distress, and this distress can last long after the scam has occurred. It's why we need a comprehensive economy-wide Scams Prevention Framework, a framework that goes to the source of scams—the banks, the telecommunications providers and the social media networks. We're all familiar with texts pretending to be from trusted organisations like Australia Post with dodgy links that will steal your credit card details, or automated calls, supposedly from the ATO, threatening fines or legal action if you don't pay on the spot. It feels like every time you go on Facebook or Instagram, deepfake videos imitating celebrities or politicians tell you a life-changing investment opportunity is within reach, only to embroil you in an elaborate investment scam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We lose over $200 per Australian every year to scams because government and big business aren't doing enough to stop scams at the source. I know we're not doing enough because my office hears from so many people who have lost money to scams, and I want to share with you some of their stories. In 2023, the Wangaratta District Men's Shed had $25,000 stolen in a scam. This was money raised from donations from Commonwealth government grants and community events, put aside to ensure the Men's Shed could continue to play its important role in our local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Men's Shed received a message saying that they had a virus on their computer and to contact Microsoft. They called the number provided and were told their bank account had been hacked and to transfer $400 to fix the issue. They were then told that Microsoft had inadvertently deposited $30,000 into the Men's Shed's account. The Men's Shed were told to transfer this money back to a Microsoft account, but when they did, the criminal stole $25,000. All along, members thought the emails and calls were genuine. They just wanted to fix a problem, but, instead, they fell victim to a crime. When they contacted Bendigo Bank, they were told it would take weeks to investigate the matter, and, when they contacted the police, they were told there was not much anyone could do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I also met Nina, from Wodonga, in my electorate. In 2022, Nina had $11,600 stolen by a 'Hi, Mum' scam. Nina's daughter was travelling overseas, so when a text arrived from an unknown number, explaining that she'd broken her phone—well, it made sense. Nina said, 'The text used the sort of language we would use when we exchanged our text messages,' and they continued over several days. Understandably, Nina was deeply upset, saying, 'We work so hard for this money, and then these thieves just steal your money and there seem to be no repercussions.' When I spoke to her, she emphasised that Australians should not be left to fight this on their own. Nina said there is inadequate legislation in place to protect consumers and the banks are leaving their customers in the cold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another couple in my electorate were targeted by a horrendous scam earlier this year. After scammers deceived the couple into providing their bank card details, they made multiple transactions that added up to $100,000, stolen from their account in just one day. Even though the scam put their account tens of thousands of dollars into overdraft, the bank did not block these transactions or contact the couple. What I find particularly shocking is that the bank, even after being alerted to the scam, began charging the couple hundreds of dollars in interest because of the overdraft debts. Not only did the bank fail to stop the scam or remediate it; they actually went on to punish their customers further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all these stories I'm hearing the same message. Once you've been scammed you're left on your own. Where people have tried to get even some of their money back, they're met with delays by their bank, who tell them that there's not much they can do. They just have to accept that their money is gone. Some consumers go on to make complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority—the AFCA—but outcomes often favour the banks, with one lawyer representing victims saying that to go to the AFCA you need an experienced commercial lawyer to have any real chance of success. The Consumer Action Law Centre has said that Australia's current scam response 'has been left to industry to lead and as a result, it is consumers, not business, who are paying for 96 per cent of scams losses'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2023 financial year, the big four banks delivered a record profit of nearly $32.5 billion, yet in 2022 they reimbursed just $22.3 million to scammed customers, or four per cent of total losses. Social media platforms like Google and Facebook aren't doing much better. Even the minister acknowledges that Meta is the biggest publisher of criminal scam content anywhere in the world. Despite this, and thanks to recent investigative reporting by the <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ge</span>, we know these social media platforms continue to take big money from advertisers that they know are scamming Australians. This is reprehensible. So I support a robust scam prevention framework that protects consumers and puts the onus on big banks, telcos and social media platforms to do all they can to disrupt and stop scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings us to the bill before the House today. The bill establishes the Scams Prevention Framework. Under the bill mandatory codes will be developed that have industry-specific prescriptive obligations that sectors must follow. Under the new framework applicable entities will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent, detect, disrupt and report scams. They must have arrangements in place to protect consumers from scams. Importantly, consumers include small businesses. The regulator of the framework will be the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with support from ASIC and ACMA. Initially, the sectors designated by the minister will include banks, telecommunications providers and certain digital platforms. However, the legislation could apply down the track to other sectors, like online marketplaces, superannuation funds and cryptocurrency platforms. Under the framework if an entity breaches their obligations, regulators will be able to fine them up to $50 million, creating incentives for big business to crack down on scams hurting regular Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also prescribes AFCA as the operator of an external dispute resolution scheme. This scheme aims to be the single door for consumers to go through when they have a scams complaint, whether that be with the bank, a telco or a social media site. A single front door can make it easier to get support and to receive an appropriate remedy. Under the framework, dispute resolution rules will require services to provide the consumer with written documentation setting out how they complied with the Scams Prevention Framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says the framework is a consumer centred approach by legislating obligations and codes that banks, telcos and digital platforms must abide by to prevent and disrupt scams and ensure consumers are protected before the scam occurs. There is a lot I welcome in this bill—in particular, having a whole-of-ecosystem approach with a single front door to make it easier for consumers to get help. However, I have listened to the concerns of consumer groups and policy experts that say that this bill does not do nearly enough for the people who are ultimately the ones who suffer from scams. The Consumer Action Law Centre, the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, the Financial Rights Legal Centre, Financial Counselling Australia and CHOICE are all calling on the government to improve this bill. They want a model where a bank would, by default, compensate a scam victim and then apportion liability across the banking, telco and digital platform sectors. If a consumer has been grossly negligent then a bank or other service will have the opportunity to prove this. It means the consumer is put first and then the banks, telcos and social media platforms. This matters. These consumer groups are calling this model the 'modified reimbursement model'. It would incentivise industry to do all they possibly can to detect and prevent scams because, if they don't, they will be on the hook to pay up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister for Financial Services, Stephen Jones, has said that, if Australia takes up such a reimbursement model, 'You will get every scammer in the world saying, "Come to Australia, it's a victimless crime because the bank will always pay".' I disagree with the minister on two fronts. Firstly, this implies we cannot do two things at once, that we cannot prevent scams while also making it easier and fairer for consumers to seek redress. Secondly, it ignores the data from other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, that shows that, when the onus of reimbursement is on big business and not the consumer, total scam losses go down, and consumers get more of their money back. This shows to me that the banks are not doing nearly enough on scam detection and prevention here in Australia. Requiring them to reimburse scam victims upfront and then make their case to the ACCC sounds like a pretty good incentive to me and would be better reflective of the power imbalance between these multibillion-dollar companies and everyday Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, while a single-door model is needed and is welcome, there are concerns about how open this door really is. The Consumer Action Law Centre plotted the journey a typical bank customer would have to take to get redress under the current bill. They say it's almost a 30-step process and could take between 18 months and two years, and, even at the end of it, victims might not get their money back because the onus lies on them to prove that the banks did something wrong. This bill would deter many victims from seeking redress in the first place, undermining the very purpose of the bill and ensuring the banks, telcos and social media platforms are not held to account and Australians lose more to scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To address these concerns and truly put the consumer at the centre of scam prevention, I urge the government to support amendments moved by the crossbench in this place and in the Senate. I understand these have been drafted with the support of the Consumer Action Law Centre, and these amendments would, firstly, provide better protection for vulnerable people who are victims of scams and, secondly, require banks, telcos and social media providers to give a statement about whether they have complied with their obligations. The statement would be used in internal and external dispute resolution, requiring these entities that often have thousands of employees, including lawyers, cybersecurity experts and fraud management staff, to be totally transparent to a customer who is a victim of a scam about the steps they took to prevent that scam. This can significantly add to the distress a person is already experiencing, and this amendment would alleviate that. Thirdly, if the government won't implement a modified reimbursement model then they should amend the bill to include a presumption of compensation paid to the scam victim from the regulated entity where that entity has failed to comply with their obligations under this bill. This would help alleviate the disproportionate burden that falls on scam victims to access compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I will support this bill because we must do more to protect Australians from the scourge of scams, but this bill must be improved. Let's put in place a world-class scam prevention framework that makes the banks and social media platforms do everything they can to disrupt and prevent scams and a framework that puts everyday Australian consumers first.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:14</span>):  I rise in strong support of the legislation to amend the Competition and Consumer Act through the introduction of the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024, a critical step forward in protecting Australians from the devastating impact of scams in our rapidly evolving digital economy. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services in bringing together this framework and acknowledge all the work that he's done on scams, putting this on the agenda even before we were in government and taking leadership to ensure that Australians are protected from scams. I note that this is one of many significant contributions that he's made in his 15 years in parliament. I was really sorry to hear last week that he will be leaving parliament at the next election, and I just wanted to take this opportunity to say what an inspiration he's been to me and to many, always standing up for the issues that matter most and for people that need a voice. Even when it's been difficult, he's always done that. Scams is an example of that, and this is another great piece of work that he's delivered that will make a difference to the lives of so many Australians. I just want to thank him for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As everyone in this chamber knows, the scourge of scams has touched the lives of far too many in our community. Every week we, as local members, hear heartbreaking stories from constituents, from people of all ages, who have lost their life savings, who have had their personal information exploited or who have suffered immense emotional distress. This legislation before us today is one part of our government's strong coordinated response to this growing and ever-evolving threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July this year I held a forum with the Assistant Treasurer in my electorate. Over 300 people turned up to that forum, which shows the immense interest and concern in this issue and the fact that many of those people had their own experiences. We've all experienced attempted scams—we're all familiar with the text messages, emails and phone calls that we get—but I have heard some truly heartbreaking stories from my constituents who have lost significant, life-changing amounts of money. One case—a constituent who was investing money on her mother's behalf—involved very sophisticated scams. It took many months of groundwork to get to the point of the actual scam impersonating trusted organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our forum we heard stories that made it clear that scams are not mere inconveniences. They are attacks on people's trust, financial security and digital confidence. This engagement and the insights shared confirmed to me just how urgently we must act to protect everyone from these scams, particularly those most vulnerable. As a member of the House Economics Committee I can say that this has long been a focus of questioning from members on all sides. I've had the chance to question the CEOs of the four big banks about their measures to combat scams against their customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on a strong foundation of work by the Albanese government to combat scammers and protect consumers. Since coming into office, our government has taken decisive action to reverse years of rising scam losses and put the needs of Australians front and centre. The establishment of the National Anti-Scam Centre in July last year marked a turning point. The centre—a world-leading collaboration between government, law enforcement and the private sector—is equipped with cutting-edge technology to disrupt scams before they reach consumers. Already we have seen remarkable early successes. Scam losses reported to Scamwatch decreased by 60 per cent in just one week of January this year compared to the same period in 2023. Over the last year, the centre's coordinated efforts drove a significant 43 per cent reduction in scam losses for the October to December quarter, reversing a troubling trend that saw scam losses double year on year under the previous government. For the first time since 2016, scam losses have actually gone in the right direction. In 2023, Australians lost $2.74 billion to scams, down 13 per cent from $3.15 billion the previous year. There's more work to do, but this is a significant impact that our policies are already having.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Central to these efforts is the innovative work of the National Anti-Scam Centre's fusion cell initiative. By bringing together banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms, the fusion cell has been able to intercept and disrupt scams in real time. This coordinated approach recently prevented a consumer from transferring $300,000 to a fraudulent investment scheme, demonstrating the power of collaboration to keep Australians safe. We are also implementing advanced technologies such as Call Stop to disrupt scam calls. Additionally, our intel-sharing partnership with the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange enables near-real-time data sharing, helping us rapidly identify and disrupt scam tactics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure our strategy remains comprehensive, we've invested an additional $67½ million in the 2024-25 budget to support the introduction of new industry codes. These codes will impose strict obligations on banks, telcos, social media platforms and digital messaging services to prevent, detect, disrupt, respond to and report scams. Importantly, this legislation sets out tough penalties for noncompliance, reinforcing our commitment to consumer protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this progress is very welcome, we want the amount lost by Australians to scammers to be zero. It is clear that we need stronger coordinated and enforceable protections across all sectors. The Scams Prevention Framework delivers exactly that. It establishes a robust set of principles—prevention, detection, disruption, reporting and response—that regulated entities must adhere to. These principles will bring together telecommunications companies, social media platforms, banks and digital platforms to act decisively against scams. It will no longer be enough to say, 'We've done what we can.' Under this framework, all relevant entities will be held to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time, we will see a sophisticated network for sharing and reporting actionable scam intelligence across both government and industry. This level of collaboration and information sharing will enable us to not only react to scams more effectively but also proactively disrupt scam activities before they cause harm. The penalties for non-compliance are significant, and rightly so. With fines reaching up to $50 million, there is no room for complacency. The impact of scams on Australian consumers is too severe for us to accept anything less than full accountability from those who provide the platforms, services and channels through which scammers operate. This framework ensures that consumers have clear and accessible paths to dispute resolution. By mandating internal dispute resolution schemes and establishing a single external mechanism for cross-sector investigations and redress, we are putting the needs of scam victims front and centre. This legislation is not about punishing legitimate businesses. It is about ensuring they play their role in protecting the communities they serve. By working together, we can make the digital economy a safer, more trustworthy place for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be a member of a government that takes scams seriously and is acting decisively to combat them. For a decade the former government was asleep at the wheel while the modern-day bank robbers took advantage. Our government is acting. We're acting to protect Australians, empower our communities and send a clear message to scammers: Australia is ready, resilient and united against you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware some in the community would like to see the government take a different approach. Scams, as I have said, can have a devastating effect on individuals and families, and it is crucial that we take effective action to ensure that Australians are protected. Some in my community would like to see us go down the route of the UK model, and I understand why that model is attractive to many. However, I'm convinced it is not the best or right approach for Australia. In the UK, regulators are requiring banks to reimburse customers who have lost money to scams, even when the transaction has not been a failing on the part of that bank. Many scam victims are targeted through social media advertisements or via a telecommunications provider. To me, it would seem illogical that these businesses, who have made money transmitting the scammer's crimes, would be exempt from any liability, and that is the case in the UK.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were to implement such a scheme, it also might provide an incentive for scammers to further target Australians. In the UK, that is shown in their data. In the period from April to June this year, there were over 8,700 complaints about scams, which is up from just over 6,000 in the previous year when their new framework was not in place. In contrast, the actions of the Australian government since we came to office have seen scam losses decrease. In 2023, Australians lost $2.7 billion to scams, down from $3.1 billion in 2022. The UK regulator has now significantly scaled back their reimbursement scheme. There is, obviously, a role for the banks to play here. If there genuinely has been a failing on the part of the bank to stop a scam, in a way which they could, they should be held liable and should be required to reimburse their customer, and this is exactly what this bill implements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly concerned about the attitude of some of the big banks to scam victims, from what I've heard from my constituents. As well, there has not been enough work done to shut down mule accounts as they appear. I've asked the banks about this in recent House economics hearings with their CEOs, but this bill strikes the right balance. It protects Australians. It puts obligations on the banks, on the telcos and on social media giants. It builds on the strong reforms our government has already implemented, and it goes a long way to ensuring that Australians are the hardest targets for scammers to commit their insidious crimes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't stop until Australians are fully protected. To all my constituents who have spoken with me about their experiences, we are really listening to you. That is why we're taking this action and implementing this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:26</span>):  It's not a stretch to say that literally everyone I know has received a scam phone call, email or text message in the last month and that almost once a week I find myself talking to my parents, my kids or my friends about a message they've received that they're just not sure should be opened. Whether it's banking, socialising, managing our health, shopping or communicating with government agencies, like the ATO, our everyday lives are increasingly being funnelled online. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, it's untenable to try and avoid scams by simply following the advice that is, 'If you don't know, don't open it,' especially when the upshot of not opening something might mean missing an important appointment window or getting smacked with a late fee. Sadly, however, gone are the days of the dodgy kerbside charlatan urging us to 'watch the cup' as a strategy to fleece us of our money. Scams these days are sophisticated, pervasive and almost entirely online. Even for the most diligent and informed of us, they are difficult to spot and avoid. As Australian citizens we're particularly susceptible, because our current industry-led protections are minimal, piecemeal and inconsistent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister has noted, an eye watering $2.74 billion was lost by Australians to scammers in 2023. While that is a huge sum, the truth is that it's likely even higher, as many people will not report the experience once they've been stung. Losses frequently also go far beyond financial pain, extending to a loss of security, confidence and, ultimately, wellbeing. As a smart, compassionate and innovative society, this vulnerability cannot be allowed to continue. While I would much prefer industry self-regulation to have been the answer, that has not worked. As such, we're left with no choice but for the government to step in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I welcome this debate on the proposed Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024, as I believe legislative reform is now necessary to modernise consumer protections for the digital age. This legislation has at least started a conversation around responsibility and accountability that is well past due. Unfortunately, I think there are still serious shortcomings in this bill that need to be addressed. The principles based obligations being applied through the legislation to regulated entities offering regulated services in regulated sectors provides clarity to sectors, in terms of minimum expectations for preventing, detecting, reporting, disrupting and responding to scams. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement that regulated entities not only maintain records and share information across the scam's ecosystem but also implement internal dispute resolution processes for consumers subject to scams is a great place to start. Yet both my community and I believe this legislation should have gone forward, and, unlike the member who we just heard speak, my community believes that we should have been brought into line with other jurisdictions like the UK where these entities are not just responsible for tackling the problem but ultimately also liable for compensation. If there's one thing we know to be true, it is that money is an extraordinary motivator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, while the bill accounts for the ever-evolving scams landscape by giving the minister the ability to designate new 'regulated sectors' and develop sector-specific codes as required, I note a general concern, echoed by the scrutiny committee, that this government is increasingly relying on the provision of ministerial discretion in its legislation and placing matters integral to the operation of the bills in delegated legislation. This worries me for two reasons: firstly, while it may make sense in the short term, it also creates potential problems as ministers and government and ambitions change; and, secondly, it sends a signal that the government isn't certain it has gotten the legislation right in the first place, so it's providing itself with a 'just in case' card that could enable future decisions that are inconsistent with this parliament's ambitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of oversight, the bill establishes civil penalties for regulated entities and identifies the ACCC as the Scams Prevention Framework general regulator, giving the ACCC the overarching responsibility of providing oversight and acting as a repository for scams information. It may be that the ACCC is the agency best placed to manage this, but with several other responsibilities recently passed to this body, including oversight of all measures and acquisitions in this country, I'm honestly worried it will be swamped. I therefore urge the government in the strongest possible terms to ensure the ACCC is adequately funded and resourced and for my colleagues in this place to be diligent when it comes to scrutinising future budgets to ensure this resource commitment is maintained. We cannot afford for this government to make these steps and decisions now only to allow future government to come in and gut the undertaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to make the additional comment that the Australian Financial Complaints Authority has been identified as the external dispute regulator—an entity that already has lengthy wait times and, in my constituents' personal experience, a frustrating lack of effectiveness given the disappointingly narrow remit in the types of disputes it will resolve. Again, this needs to be adequately scoped and resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally and most critically, the bill provides a redress mechanism for scam victims where a regulated entity is found to have contravened a civil penalty provision, a provision that for many really cuts to the heart of the current weakness in our domestic environment—that being a complete lack of clarity around who is responsible for losses incurred via third-party platforms. As I've said previously, while I welcome the clarity, we need greater responsibility for compensation being passed to the channels that most frequently allow the abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this legislation seeks to clarify obligations, responsibilities and pathways for dispute resolution, it has failed to transfer enough of the burden of combating scams and absorbing the financial losses to those best placed to address them. All too frequently, people will share their heartbreaking stories of being scammed with me, and, every time they do, I'm left frustrated and angry. One person recently contacted me because their elderly parents had lost $250,000 to an investment scam that was presented as an opportunity with two well-known financial institutions. Once discovered, neither institution accepted any responsibility for the counterfeiting of their brand or their response. Quite frankly, they were completely heartless. Another person told me about their experience of signing up for a recurrent monthly charge to join what was eventually proven to be a fake dating site. Shockingly, in this case, the bank refused to help the person affected recover their payments because the bank argued the customer had given their details freely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The HSBC impersonation scam impacted several people in my community. I can't help but feel strongly that scams involving banks are particularly egregious. In a digital economy, where branches are being closed every day and speaking to a real person on the ground in Australia can be such a challenge, many of us have no choice but to rely on internet banking. Surely, then, aside from the transactional convenience, banks should be ultimately responsible for ensuring they provide us with a safe place to keep our money and processes that ensure fraudulent transactions cannot be progressed without complete certainty that our money is going to a legitimate purpose. It used to take 10 days for a cheque to clear and three days or more for funds to transfer between banks. How is it not possible then to institute some sort of airlock function that creates opportunities for transactions to be scrutinised before they're finalised? In almost all cases, the frustrating reality is that people who are scammed are not clear about who they should contact or how to pursue a remedy, and, whilst trying to deal with what is often a significant personal loss, they are left feeling angry, embarrassed and helpless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerningly, a recent investigation by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> suggests Google's search algorithms are in fact routing us to fraudsters, with fake websites and investment platforms and fake reviews, including AI generated celebrity endorsements, proliferating online. Yet there is little to no accountability. In trying to search the internet to determine what to do about a potential scam, we're being unwittingly delivered into the hands of the scammers themselves, and the catch-22 situation continues, with the boundaries between real and fake becoming increasingly sophisticated and the pathways for help harder to find.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data tells us scams disproportionately impact older, more vulnerable Australians including those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, while social media scams took over $200,000 from kids under 18 in 2024 alone. Yet, as platforms like Meta and Google and banks like CBA and Westpac post eye-watering profits, those fleeced of money via their channels are left holding the can. Helping vulnerable individuals navigate the complicated complaints and dispute resolution process is absolutely a priority. Victims of scams reeling from the sick feeling of having been duped out of their hard earned savings should not have to prove that the multiple organisations involved, from telcos to banks and from social media platforms to search engines themselves, have not complied with their own antiscam processes. To do so would be impossible, given it would require consumers to have access to documents and evidence held by the regulated entity who themselves would be incentivised to delay or fail to disclose that information. The cost, time and difficulty in seeking compensation could discourage claims even when there is a notional dispute resolution process in place. It's clear that the burden of proof should be on industry participants to show compliance with the Scams Prevention Framework in defence of claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the amendments proposed by the member for Mackellar and the member for Warringah that seek to level the playing field through additional, reasonable steps regulated entities must take to protect vulnerable community members and a presumption of disclosure of relevant documents to assist victims in pursuing their complaints. I also agree with ASIC's recommendation that broadly states that, where compensation has been paid to a victim of a particular scam, all victims of the scam should be automatically eligible for reimbursement without having to undertake their own complaints processes. To me, it's just logical, efficient and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As more and more services push consumers to transact entirely online, surely those services have a responsibility to foot the bill when scammers successfully hack or mimic their processes. Instead, while this legislation provides scam victims with a mechanism for the recovery of damages, it stopped short of following the UK in implementing mandatory compensation. As of October last year, people in the UK who fall foul of a scam can claim up to 85,000 pounds compensation, and it will be given to them within five days. It's possible because the cost of that compensation is now split between the banks of both the victim and the fraudster. Interestingly, the UK already had a robust voluntary code for reimbursement which covered about 90 per cent of scam losses, but we have no such code in Australia, with the data instead suggesting that just four per cent of scam losses are recovered by victims. This is perhaps the most crucial shortcoming of this bill. A presumption of reimbursement, except in the case of negligence, seems obvious to me if we are to truly incentivise financial institutions, telcos and other entities to do more than just meet the minimum obligations and to avoid placing the onus on scams victims to fight for compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the recommendation of Senator Pocock and the Consumer Action Law Centre that compensation be presumed when a regulated entity is found not to have complied with their obligations under the framework and codes. Again, this just seems logical and fair to me. Consumers should not have to jump through hoops to be reimbursed following negligence from their bank or telco. Without a direct bottom-line incentive, I don't believe there's enough in this legislation to ensure industry invests sufficiently to keep pace with AI and the sophistication of scammers more broadly. I'm also left wondering whether the multiregulator model and proposed information-sharing protocols will result in efficient, real-time intelligence sharing or if the system will simply be too unwieldy. With many regulators in the mix and the overlay of privacy obligations, I hope the extra regulatory and compliance costs are warranted, but this is yet to be seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I was really pleased to see recent government investment in a broader public education campaign about scams and identification. Scamwatch is a fantastic resource, and I have personally seen it in action twice, during two community seminars that my team and I hosted with Scamwatch in North Sydney. The Scamwatch presenters were articulate and compassionate and patiently taught people how to not only recognise but also respond to scams. Our second session was bilingual, presented in both English and Mandarin, and the response to it was incredible, proving that people armed with the information they need are more confident. For this reason, I believe any education in this space that ensures the phrase 'Stop, check, protect' becomes as iconic as 'Slip, slop, slap' is worthwhile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, while I stand by my statement at the outset that this bill takes some steps in the right direction, it's yet another piece of legislation from this government that falls short of how far it could have gone. Instead of rushing through a legislative program with cursory scrutiny, the government would do to well to pick a few key pieces of legislation that the community wants and needs, like this one, and focus on getting it completely right.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2024. It's another example of a policy challenge which it has taken a Labor government to get on top of. Even before bringing this new framework to parliament, the Assistant Treasurer had overseen the first reduction in scam theft in Australia in nearly a decade. In 2023, despite a 19 per cent increase in the number of reports, Australians lost 13 per cent less to scams than they did the year before. It's a significant turnaround, and I acknowledge the Assistant Treasurer's work in my electorate, together with many other electorates across the country. But despite this progress, this challenge isn't going away, and there is more to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all heard heartbreaking stories of people in our communities being scammed. These include stories I've heard at the several scams forums I've held in my electorate, including at Long Jetty and Toukley, the first around three years ago. I've heard the devastation of losing hard-earned savings or watching family and friends suffer through this experience. That includes my mother, who was a victim of a scam, an identity theft, and ended up having to replace her personal identification: her drivers licence, her passport and her credit card. I spoke to her about it again tonight, and she said that not only did it take a long time but having to go through this induced a lot of anxiety. I've heard the pain of people who have been tricked by those who pretend to come to them with something to offer only to reveal that what they are, in fact, is predators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community on the Central Coast of New South Wales is as vulnerable to scams as any other. What's pleasing to me is that we are also growing people's awareness of these scams and people's ability to identify them, report them and not fall victim to them. Shortly after a scams awareness forum I held with the Assistant Treasurer in Long Jetty, Frank from The Entrance got in touch with my office. He said: 'Thanks for your scams information. It was timely, as I'd just received one about unpaid tolls. I referred it to Scamwatch with all the information available.' There are too many stories just like Frank's, but it's so important that Frank had the information and the ability to then report the scam to make other people less likely to be victims of this scam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scams Prevention Framework contained in this bill takes another important step in our work to protect the Australian community. The bill implements the government's election commitment to require social media companies, banks and telecommunications providers to take robust steps to prevent and respond to scams impacting consumers, and it creates the framework to do this: prevention, detection, reporting, disruption and response. We know the vast majority of businesses want to protect their customers from scams—of course they do. Many will already be working to these principles, and we recognise that and acknowledge it. This legislation offers the chance to strengthen our efforts through the development of strong, legally enforceable, sector-specific codes which will spell out the obligations for regulated sectors. The new laws create an enforcement regime, bringing in the ACCC, ASIC and the Australian Communications and Media Authority—giving it teeth—and they give consumers new rights and avenues for redress if entities in those regulated sectors fail to meet their obligations. The framework will mean that all points of the scam<span class="HPS-MemberContinuation"></span>chain are held to account, and it will work in a cross-sector way to deal with scammers operating across multiple platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, scams are a global challenge and demand international cooperation. That is why the framework supports the government and industry in international engagement and collaboration. I mentioned the shared purpose most businesses have with the government in wanting to protect their customers. With more sharing of intelligence across regulated entities in the Australian economy, the framework can in turn support this work abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity costs of scams in our country are enormous—some $2.7 billion in 2023. Let's assume, for a moment, that amount was equally shared across the 151 electorates of the members of this House. That represents nearly $18 million per seat. The people of my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales can't afford to lose $18 million, and nor can people across the country. That's why this legislation matters. Reducing scam loss is important as it affects too many Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I commend the bill and in doing so acknowledge the responsible minister and member for Whitlam, Stephen Jones, for his work. I wish him well as he leaves this place at the next election.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Despite most of us in this place having turned our minds to the forthcoming election, it's also worth us reflecting on what's happened and been achieved in this term of parliament. The 2022 election brought us a new federal government and, mercifully, an unprecedented number of Independents. This has undeniably helped lift the tone of the parliament and helped ensure some good outcomes. For instance, we finally established the National Anti-Corruption Commission, something I and many others have long called for. This parliament has also enacted some reforms on climate change, which, while far from perfect, were needed after nine years of inaction by the previous government. Other notable outcomes championed by the crossbench include making the stage 3 tax cuts fairer, reforming the aged-care system and making HECS indexation more affordable for students and those with student debts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particular highlights for me have included legislating a date to end live sheep exports, banning credit card use for gambling and busting Julian Assange out of Belmarsh prison—all issues I have pushed hard on for many years. But we've also had our fair share of disappointments over the last three years, with some shocking behaviour towards each other, wilful ignorance on some issues and downright gutlessness on others—not least this government's abandonment of environmental law reform and the gambling advertising ban.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it shouldn't take an election to do it, I'm hoping all of us will now take the time to refocus and reprioritise the things that matter most to the community. This means standing up to big corporations and vested interests and making decisions for the benefit of our constituents. Moreover, Australians are demanding a sharper focus on the soaring cost of living as well as the housing and health crises. It's not enough to tinker around the edges anymore and to pretend the job has been done. Australians are also desperate for improved services from the ATO, Centrelink, the NDIS and DVA. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect by their government and to be able to trust that government services are actually there to help. Instead, too often these systems grind on and people fall through the cracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also hear from my community, and from thousands across the country, is encouragement to continue pursuing meaningful political donations reform, gambling reform and media freedom and whistleblower reform as well as stronger action on climate change and welfare and more humane treatment of asylum seekers. I plan to take these priorities forward and, should the people of Clark choose me again, I will do all I can to progress them in the next parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  Western Sydney airport has the potential to transform the Macarthur area and far beyond. If you look at Macarthur on a map you will very quickly conclude that transport, particularly rail, is key for locals to get to and from their workplaces, job sites, schools, universities and key appointments in major city centres such as Sydney CBD, Parramatta, Liverpool and others. Soon there will also be another major working commercial site up and running in the Bradfield area and the soon-to-be opened Western Sydney airport business precinct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an exciting opportunity for my electorate, but I am very fearful that we might miss the boat—or in this case the train and plane—to have a rail line built to connect our region to the aerotropolis. I've always believed that rail is the best way to connect our region, as our main roads, particularly the Northern Road, the M7, the M5 and the M8, are congested already—they're more congested than ever before—and the proposed rapid bus service to the airport is likely to be a very slow, tortoise-like movement because of the traffic on the major linking roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, having rail would enable commuters from connecting lines to link up, thereby expanding access to the airport precinct and helping bolster its financial viability. The fact that the past New South Wales and federal Liberal-National governments did not proceed with the construction of a rail corridor in our region to Western Sydney airport shows just how little they focused on south-west Sydney and how poorly they understand the new rapidly growing areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm having constructive discussions with my federal and New South Wales Labor colleagues regarding the need for rail, and we are, in fact, proceeding with a scoping study about this. But I don't need a scoping study to tell me that a rail link to Western Sydney Airport is vital. I'm delighted to see that we also have been able to fund the Campbelltown Station car park upgrade that will bring over 500 new spots for commuters. I'm really delighted with the announcement recently that the Fifteenth Avenue upgrades will proceed, which will improve the road links, but we need the rail. Rome wasn't built in a day, but it would have been completed sooner if they'd had a rail line to connect their workers to the site! We will complete that rail line, and it is very important to link Macarthur to a whole range of areas including Wollondilly, Wollongong, the Illawarra, the Moorebank intermodal, the Southern Highlands, Sydney and Kingsford Smith Airport, north-west Sydney, northern New South Wales and western New South Wales. The list is endless. We must get this rail link done and we will as a Labor government. I'm committed to making sure this happens, so let's get the rail link to Western Sydney airport done.</span>

And so can you imagine the frustration of a community that has had a service that is no longer available? The community of Wee Waa have been very angry and upset by the actions of Hunter New England Health. They have closed Wee Waa Hospital. The emergency department closes at 5.30 every day. There is no visiting medical officer, and this hospital is largely underutilised. There are wards with beds. There are treatment rooms. Everything is ready to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the reassurances of the independent state member and the New South Wales health minister, there appears to be no action by Hunter New England Health in this regard. Hunter New England Health do have form there, I think, showing a lack of interest in the issues of and services for people in northern New South Wales. The community of Wee Waa have been publicly protesting. They have been trying to reach out to the New South Wales government. The Narrabri Shire Council mayor, Mayor Tiemens, has been very active in this space. It just needs the hierarchy and the leadership of Hunter New England Health to step out of Newcastle, go to Wee Waa, and come up with a solution. There are four doctors in Wee Waa, and none of them have the VMO rights at the local hospital. We are coming up to the cotton-picking season. There will be lots of heavy machinery and lots of people working in the fields. Young mums will need to bypass Wee Waa to go to Narrabri to have a baby.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just Wee Waa. Wee Waa Hospital services a big community, largely to the west. There are communities from Burren Junction up to Rowena and nearly as far out as Walgett. Those people of western New South Wales rely on Wee Waa Hospital. I'm calling on the New South Wales government and Hunter New England Health to get behind the people of Wee Waa, get their skates on, hop in the car, drive to Wee Waa and fix this problem that should be very, very simply fixed with just a bit of gumption and purpose. The people of Wee Waa deserve a health service that's reliable and available, and I'm backing them in on this.</span>

I will always be a champion for my community, and I'm really pleased at what we have already managed to achieve together. It was an exciting day when I attended the opening of the new headspace in my electorate—a much needed service for the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. This joins the headspace just a few doors down from my office near Syndal Station, and it has been inspiring to meet with the staff and youth advisory groups at both of these centres. Both centres are very loved and absolutely critical parts of the local community.</span>

A free clinic, this service provides care and reduces pressure on emergency departments. This clinic means that injuries and illnesses can be attended to quickly. I speak to people in our community all the time about the practice, and I'm struck by the incredibly positive experiences that are shared with me about the urgent care clinic. I've met with the medical staff at the clinic, and the passion, care and dedication they demonstrate is just so clear, and we are so fortunate to have such hardworking professionals serving our community in Chisholm.</span>

We know that the coalition, and quite especially the Leader of the Opposition, has form<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>when it comes to gutting and cutting Medicare and health services.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from the thousands and thousands of conversations I've had through doorknocking and making phone calls in the electorate that action on climate change and gender equality are key issues for the voters in my terrific community in Chisholm. I'm really pleased that one of the very first acts of our government was to legislate a climate target, and we have more renewables and renewable projects than ever before. We're making substantial progress on closing the gender pay gap, and we're the first majority female government in Australia's history, which means that reforms that get us closer to gender equality, such as changes to paid parental leave and a national plan to eliminate gendered violence, absolutely are supported by our government. I'm proud to be part of a government that gets things done for the nation and delivers for the community of Chisholm.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  I'm very proud to represent a very multicultural seat with lots of celebrations. This past week was an exceptional week in which we celebrated the incredible lunar new year. These celebrations took place all across Adelaide, marking the Year of the Snake for 2025—a symbol of wisdom, transformation and resilience. Celebrations started off last week at the South Australian Zhu-Lin Buddhist Association's temple. The SA Zhu-Lin Buddhist Association hosted a truly remarkable celebration, which thousands attended to see in the Year of the Snake at midnight. It featured fireworks, lion dances and other traditional activities. It was a magnificent event full of joy and full of celebration. Seeing the community celebrate the Year of the Snake and bring in the new year was a fantastic sight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heartfelt thanks go to Quoc Long Ha, the president of the association, and Mr Charles Tran, a senior committee member, for personally inviting me, as they do every year. I've been attending this very special event for nearly the last 20 years. I'd also like to thank Mrs Say Kapsis for her support and of course my very good friend Stephen Chueng, who's been on the committee on and off over the last 20 years and who's always a fixture at this particular event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chinese new year was also celebrated at a dinner at the Adelaide Zoo, which was hosted by the Premier and the honourable Consul-General of China. The highlight of the event, which made it even more special, was the arrival of two giant pandas, Xing Qiu and Yi Lan, to the Adelaide Zoo; these majestic animals are now available for public viewing. They perfectly complemented the lunar new year festivities, adding harmony and cultural significance. A special thankyou to the Consul-General of China, Mr Li Dong, for making this possible for us and for his hard work, together with the Premier of South Australia and the federal minister for trade, Don Farrell, in getting exports back into China. He should be recognised for the enormous work he's done with the federal government and the state government of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, on the weekend the SA chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia hosted the Tet Festival, with the theme 'Home away from home'. This year marks 50 years since South Australia welcomed Vietnamese boat people, a resilient community that has done so well. They've overcome adversity to enrich our nation. Their contributions not only benefit Vietnamese Australians but enrich the lives of all Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend we have the Chinatown Adelaide Lunar New Year Street Party in my electorate, and I'm looking forward to attending that in Chinatown in the federal seat of Adelaide; it promises to be another vibrant celebration. May the Year of the Snake bring health, happiness and prosperity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I want to speak about the remarkable community spirit in Bradfield, the electorate that I've been privileged to represent in this place for 15 years. Last Saturday, as one manifestation of that community spirit, the Killara Rural Fire Service station opened. This has been the culmination of many years of work and planning to establish the new Killara Rural Fire Brigade in 2017 and to build this magnificent new station in Koola Avenue in East Killara opposite Killara High School. I particularly congratulate deputy captain and brigade president Stuart Clark, who has worked for many years to achieve this outcome, as well as brigade captain Andrew Wilson and all of the volunteers who serve in the NSW Rural Fire Service, not just in the Killara brigade but locally in the Ku-ring-gai brigade and of course across New South Wales and Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, I held my annual Bradfield community Christmas drinks, and we recognised three outstanding local organisations and asked each of them to brief the assembled group of over 100 people on the great work that they do. We heard from Elizabeth Lovell of Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury. There's a very big facility that they have in Gordon, in the electorate of Bradfield, and, as the name suggests, they serve people from the harbour up to the Hawkesbury River and beyond, including through the lots of counsellors who work on the enormously valuable Lifeline telephone counselling service. I've heard from many of them stories about people they have helped—people who are in considerable distress and, in some cases, considering ending their own lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard at this event from Kevin Hao, a very impressive young man in my electorate who has just finished year 12 with outstanding results. While he was at high school he founded an organisation called Youth 4 Difference, which has attracted large numbers of high-school students to volunteer for a whole range of important causes. I joined them last year along with Gisele Kapterian, the then Liberal candidate for North Sydney and the now Liberal candidate for Bradfield, at a community barbecue at Bunnings in support of the DANII Foundation, which works to deal with the scourge of diabetes and early onset diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard, at my Christmas event just before Christmas, from Fran Signorelli, of Hope in a Suitcase. This is a wonderful volunteer organisation which repairs suitcases full of personal items, clothing and toys for children who are going into foster care and often finding themselves in a situation where they have very few or no personal effects with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge all these wonderful volunteers and the many other volunteer organisations across the electorate of Bradfield. Thank you for the work you do to make our community a more fortunate place and for the help that you give so many others.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  As I stand here in Australia's parliament, hundreds are gathering at The Transfiguration of Our Lord Greek Orthodox Church of Thomastown. They're gathering in solemn mourning, remembrance and celebration of an extraordinary life—that of my friend Sofia Mastoris OAM. It is fitting she be remembered in this place as well as in the community she served. The Scullin community and I have lost a dear friend and a dear comrade in the passing of Sofia. I recognise she was a member of the Labor Party for 43 years amongst many other very significant accomplishments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is impossible, as I believe, to imagine Melbourne today without the extraordinary imprint of the Greek Australian community, it's impossible to overstate the influence of Sofia on that community, particularly in the northern suburbs and particularly in terms of her work with Greek women. She dedicated her life to empowering women in the Greek community. In particular in her role as president of the Hellenic Women's Federation, she worked tirelessly and effectively to advocate for Greek heritage. She was also a deeply impressive advocate for the Cancer Council and promoted cancer services for many years after her own breast cancer surgery. She never stopped; she always showed kindness and compassion for others and was a very regular and much-loved visitor to my electorate office. My staff and I will miss her terribly. She was a strong advocate, a leader and an inspiration for the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here wishing I could be at the funeral itself, I send my condolences to her family. I note Sofia is survived by her son, Nonda, and her beloved grandchildren, and remembered by many who loved her across the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend, I had the very great privilege of cutting the ribbon to officially open Leading Edge Childcare and Early Learning Wollert, a fantastic family owned business bringing something very special to a growing community. I send out a very special thank you to the owners for inviting me to be part of this event and to the families I spoke with over a very enjoyable sausage sizzle on a hot day. There was a magic show, and there were some very impressive tricks by my good mate Bruce, who's far better with balloon animals and rabbits than I could ever pretend to be. I've been visiting childcare centres right across my electorate, from Goodstart in Mill Park to Great Beginnings in Epping, meeting with so many dedicated and hardworking childcare workers and early educators like Priya, from Great Beginnings, who spoke with passion about seeing the growth within our young ones and the difference they make in shaping young lives and our future, ensuring that everyone gets the best start in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the house that the Albanese government deeply understands the importance of this vital sector. That's why we are delivering a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood educators and working to entrench early education as a fundamental part of our education system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I acknowledge and pass on my best wishes to the multiple Australia Day award winners of the Medal of the Order of Australia. My first congratulations goes to Trish Nicholls, a Forster local, for services to basketball as an accomplished statistician, including the statistics involved in the Sydney Olympics and other many world events, and to Laurieton resident Adele Whelan, with over 50 years experience in services to Little Athletics through administrative roles. I'd like to recognise Great Lakes local Julie Brady for her service to the community through social welfare organisations, particularly establishing a women's shelter and providing a safe haven for women and children escaping domestic violence. A posthumous award went to the late Roger Lynch, who passed away in 2021, for his services to the Great Lakes region, not only as an accountant and businessmen but also in many community sports. It was a well-deserved award, and the award was accepted by his wife, Jan. I also recognise Ken Cameron of Marlee for his contribution of services to the Rural Fire Service and the Marlee community over many years. The Emergency Services Medal was awarded to Julie Wilcox of Forster. In the Military Awards, a Conspicuous Service Cross has been awarded to Wing Commander Benjamin Sawley of Luskintyre for his outstanding service as commanding officer of the No. 1 Flying Training School of the Royal Australian Air Force. I'd also like to congratulate Wauchope Bowling Club President Rick Simpson and all the members for their $1,000 donation supporting the Wauchope District Memorial Hospital, and the Kendall Tennis Club, who supplied another six ball kids for the prestigious United Cup, an international teams tournament held from 27 December until 5 January in Sydney and Perth. Trevor Coles, 76 years young, is the most senior competitive cricket player in the Camden Haven, and he played for the New South Wales cricket over-70s division second side when they won national championship. Joel Fleming of the Forster Aquatic Swim Club competed in the South Australian State Open, making the finals of all events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was heartbreaking to hear of the Laurieton Fishermen's Co-Op, which was destroyed by fire recently. The cause is still unknown at this stage while police investigations continue. On the upside, many community events have been organised to help the displaced fishermen whose livelihoods are in jeopardy, whilst plans are being worked on for the rebuilding and the reconstruction of the co-op, which had been operating since 1946. For all of those who have contributed to help the fishermen's co-op get up and running, I salute you. That's what makes the Lyne electorate such a strong community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  Last week, I had the pleasure of joining the Rotary Club of Westbury for its annual Australia Day breakfast and was accompanied by federal Lyons candidate Rebecca White, my good friend. Every year Westbury Rotary members host a breakfast at the local RSL, all in the aim of connecting the community over a meal and raising money for great causes. This year the event was supported by both the Australian government and the Meander Valley Council, and more than 120 people enjoyed breakfast, with thousands raised for District Governor Pam Scott OAM's campaign to end family violence. I was delighted to lend a hand at the juice station, a position I've taken up for many years, and it was great to see the community come together to enjoy each other's company and celebrate our wonderful country.  huge shout-out to everybody who made the day possible, including Westbury Rotary Club of Westbury President Carol Wood and Secretary Andrew Wood. Thank you also to club members and friends Graham Dent, Annette Barrett, Tracey Lee, Beryl Pearn, Amanda Taylor, Dinah Fitzgerald, Barry Pearn, Harley Nicholls, Miles Irving, Doug Poulton, Malcolm French, Miles Kerr, Ben Dudman, Florida Rickard, Jo Fitzgerald, Martin Wilson, Russell Whitcombe, Judy Kilby, Matthew Godfrey and Anne-Marie Loader, all of whom woke up before dawn to make sure breakfast was hot and ready from 7.30 am. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 11 Lyons constituents who received recognition in this year's Australia Day Honours. Congratulations to Duncan Kerr SC—former Attorney-General of Australia, former Federal Court judge and my boss in a previous life—who was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia. Congratulations to Denise Talbot, David Downie, Reverend Josephine Pyecroft, David Gatenby and Dr James Markos, who were all appointed Members of the Order of Australia for their service to the nation and to the Tasmanian community in their respective fields. Congratulations also to Catherine McDonald, who was awarded the Public Service Medal, Andrew Skelly, Kathryn Gillham and Adam Jones for the Australian Fire Service Medal and Curtis Salter for the Emergency Services Medal. Congratulations to all Tasmanians across Tasmania who were recognised with honours at the national, state and municipal levels for their wonderful service to their communities and to their nation. The country thanks you.</span>

I've already stated that this legislation has become necessary, and we are seeking some amendments to make this legislation even stronger in force because of the dreadful attacks that we have seen on Australian Jewish people. They were attacked simply because of their Jewish faith and ancestry, and it is completely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to what seems to have inflamed the situation in Australia, the initial spark of the antisemitic attacks that we are now seeing across our country came with the 7 October terrorist attacks on Israel by the recognised terrorist group Hamas. There can be no equivocation or denial on this. The October 7 attacks were the single greatest loss of Jewish lives on any day since the Holocaust. October 7 was a day of murder, torture, kidnapping and brutal sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas against Jews in Israel. The attacks were deliberately cruel and barbaric. We don't need to repeat a description of the heinous acts in this chamber, but there is no doubt they were designed with the purpose of maximising pain and sorrow amongst Jewish people. They also involved taking over 100 people hostage, many of whom have still not been released, more than a year after the first attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw here in this country was bad actors rejoicing in a day that was marked by the murder, torture, sexual assault and kidnapping of innocent Israelis. I have called out in this chamber members of the left, in the Labor Party as well as the Greens party, who would usually be calling out acts of violence against women. There was no call, particularly by the Australian Greens party, for the hostages to be released. There were calls for a ceasefire, and the reality is that there was a ceasefire. On 6 October 2023, there was a ceasefire. What alternative did Israel have but to go and get back her citizens? If that attack had occurred here in Australia, I would fully expect my government to instruct the military to go and return Australians, whether they be family members or friends or other Australians. These people were innocent civilians who were taken by a terrorist organisation on that day, and it is completely shameful that most members of the Labor Party and all members of the Greens have failed to call that out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen, as a result, is a lack of leadership from the very top—from the Prime Minister of our country. Why is this legislation before the House today? It has come about due to the Prime Minister's failure to lead on this issue. From day one, he refused to admit or speak about antisemitism unless he also mentioned Islamophobia and other discrimination at the same time. The attack on the Israeli people on October 7 was nothing but an antisemitic attack. It defies belief that the Prime Minister of this country was unable to call it that. Other leaders throughout the world were able to. They showed strong leadership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen from this Prime Minister and from most, but not all, members of the government has been complete silence and complete weakness about antisemitism in this country and the antisemitism that occurred on 7 October that gave rise to that. He should have made very clear through his actions from the very beginning that those who sought to spread antisemitic attacks in Australia would feel the full force of the law. He didn't. He could and should have been clear about the scale of the horror inflicted by Hamas and that Australia stands with its long-term friend and ally Israel. The Prime Minister could and should have used our laws and our police forces to clamp down on those who sought to weaponise the Hamas attacks for their own hateful purposes here at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a friend. His name is Simon. He lives in the eastern suburbs of Sydney and he is Jewish. His four-year-old daughter walks to preschool accompanied by two armed guards. That is not and should not be the Australia of 2025, but that's the reality. Jewish students don't wear their school uniform in public. Jewish students on university campuses have been subject to violent attacks. Other Jewish people have been subject to doxxing simply for being part of a WhatsApp group. This is completely unacceptable. If this were happening to any other group of Australians, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the Labor Party and the Greens party would have been calling this out, but they haven't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we had, for example, in the Prime Minister's own home state of New South Wales, an angry mob on 9 October standing outside the opera house and chanting, 'Where are the Jews?' or whatever they were saying, he was silent. We saw Jewish shops being vandalised, Jewish students being harassed and roaming gangs in places like Caulfield in Victoria hunting for Jews. This was in 2023 and 2024. This was not Germany in the 1930s. I never thought I would see this in my lifetime. I agree with the member for Wannon when he used those words as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we're responding to an unprecedented wave of antisemitism here in our country and we are seeing armed guards outside Jewish schools, it is completely appropriate that we focus on antisemitism. The Prime Minister did not do that, and his failure to do so was an indication that he did not take the threat of antisemitism seriously. In my electorate of Hughes in southern Sydney and south-west Sydney, I have fewer than 1,000 Jewish Australians. However, the very silent but very large majority of people that I've spoken to in my electorate when I've been out doorknocking, when I've conducted mobile offices and through email say that they are absolutely horrified at the Prime Minister's silence on this issue. They will very shortly get an opportunity to express to this Prime Minister and his government just how unhappy they are. A prime minister that doesn't defend his nation and doesn't stand up for a group of Australians is not worthy of being the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have existing criminal laws that are meant to deal with things like the urging of violence against groups defined by either race or religion. This is in division 80 of the Criminal Code. These laws were not used. Why not? Protests in our streets in which antisemitic displays abounded were permitted to drag on for months and months. Universities were permitted to be used as encampments that served as a hotbed of antisemitic action. Our human rights institutions were not given focus or direction nor were they called to account when they abandoned the Jewish community. Through his actions, Prime Minister Albanese sent a very clear message that, despite what he might say, there will be no real consequences for those who target and attack Jewish Australians. This was a green light for antisemites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government that he leads has also abandoned Israel on the international stage. In the wake of 7 October the instinct of the Labor government was not to stand with Israel, which had just been the target of a horrific atrocity—it was to call on Israel to exercise restraint. This was followed by a series of votes in the United Nations in which Australia, under the leadership of this Prime Minister, reversed a longstanding bipartisan position on Israel. The Foreign Minister Wong went to Israel and yet refused to go and have a look at the scene of the initial massacre. Why would she do that? She was meant to be there as our foreign minister, representing us on the international stage. I say that the foreign minister is not worthy, through her actions, of continuing to hold that position.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I commend the changes in this legislation, I still say it has come far too late, and it reflects the fact that the Prime Minister has been asleep at the wheel on this issue of antisemitism. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  It is, as the member for Hughes has just said, too little too late when it comes to this legislation and the broader issue of dealing with the scourge of rising antisemitism occurring in our country since the Hamas terror attacks on 7 October 2023. Make no mistake: the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 is necessary because of the repeated failures of the Albanese government. The Prime Minister has been stoking tensions over the past 16 months through his weak leadership and failure to act decisively to stamp out antisemitism. He has been missing in action on this very important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all about leadership, or the lack thereof. Australians look to their prime minister to set the tone of the national response to any crisis. The Prime Minister should have made clear through his actions from the very beginning that those who sought to spread antisemitic attacks here would feel the full force of the law. He should have been clear from the very beginning about the scale of the horror inflicted by Hamas and underscored Australia's allegiance to its long-term friend and ally Israel. He could—and should—have used our laws and our police forces to clamp down on those who sought to weaponise the Hamas attacks for their own hateful purposes here at home. He did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we were seeing an unprecedented rise in antisemitism, the Prime Minister and his ministers failed to acknowledge the presence of antisemitism without concurrently mentioning Islamophobia—always seeking a moral equivalence. Neither have a place in this country. Both are condemned. But acknowledging Jewish Australians' experiences of antisemitism does not diminish the experience of Muslim Australians. The Prime Minister did not address this, and his failure to do so was an indication that he did not take the threat of antisemitism seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw ongoing failures to take decisive action against antisemitism in Australia. Antisemitic displays were not prosecuted, protests were not stopped, and universities were permitted to be used as encampments. Worse still, the tone was set incorrectly from October 2023 when police arrested a man carrying an Israeli flag in Sydney during protests supporting Palestine—allegedly for his own safety. Offensive references to Jewish people were made at the same protests, which to this day continue to be debated and forensically examined to find out what was actually said. Existing criminal laws that are meant to deal with things like the urging of violence against groups defined by race or religion in division 80 of the Criminal Code were not used. Hence, antisemitic sentiment was allowed to fester. Through the Prime Minister's actions—or, conversely, inactions—the Prime Minister sent a very clear message that, despite what he might say, there will be no real consequences for those who target and attack Jewish Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this Prime Minister's inaction, we are now experiencing acts of outright terrorism—the firebombing of cars and targeting of homes, childcare centres and synagogues, including the horrific attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne in December. Most recent was the finding of a caravan packed with explosives and an alleged antisemitic plot to attack several Jewish targets. In Australia in 2025, who on earth would have thought this could be? This is now a clear campaign of terror and is not something I would ever have imagined happening in our lucky country, a place where, for generations, migrants have come across the seas to find safety, opportunity and a chance to live a better life. This is not the Australia we know and love. Attacks on Jewish Australians are attacks on our way of life—attacks on every Australian. Attacking people because of their Jewish faith or ancestry is un-Australian. Under Labor, the Jewish community now feels under siege and abandoned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This abandonment traces back not only to the failure of the Prime Minister and his government to take decisive action but also to the diplomatic abandonment of Israel, the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. This government has overturned a decades-long bipartisan position on Israel in our foreign policy, as evidenced by voting patterns at the United Nations. On the international stage, Australia appeared to reward Hamas's terrorist attacks. Diplomatic abandonment has been coupled with a weak stance on border security, including the provision of visas to thousands of people from Gaza, a war zone ruled by a listed terrorist organisation, many without proper security checks. People on visas who sympathise with terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah should be deported today. Those fleeing Gaza or Lebanon should be turned back if they are terrorist sympathisers. They do not have a place in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This failure of decisive action is a leader in crisis. In the application of existing laws, the diplomatic abandonment of Israel and weak stance on border security can only be for perceived local political gain. The Albanese government is more concerned with winning votes in Western Sydney and appeasing voters in inner-city electorates than with ensuring the protection of Jewish people in Australia and maintaining our values and way of life. If you might forgive a brief digression, Deputy Speaker, we see the same callous political games played with regional Australians. To save their seats in inner cities from the Greens, Labor is railroading regional communities with a radical rollout of wind turbines, solar panels and 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines for a political target. My point is that this Prime Minister lacks the leadership to govern for all Australians and act in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Antisemitism is inconsistent with Australian values and unthinkable in modern Australia. Australia must reject antisemitism as it must reject the persecution of any group on the basis of religion or race. Jewish people have been persecuted persistently over history, and the recent 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on 27 January 2025 reminds us of the horrors of the Holocaust, with the deaths of some six million Jews—a circumstance that all agree must never be repeated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Labor prime minister Julia Gillard told a Sky News documentary earlier this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the anti-Israel demonstrations have been caused by a distortion of history … It's a misunderstanding about how Israel came into existence. It's a misunderstanding about the nature of the conflict … And because of that, I think particularly young people are developing views about this which are unbalanced and really not informed by the history in any way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gillard went on to say, poignantly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Holocaust, of course, teaches us where antisemitism leads if it's not confronted. That is the history of Germany before the war. It didn't happen all at once … These things happened step at a time. So given we've seen that history, we're in a position when we see the first few steps to say: 'No. No more.' Let's start combating that now rather than watch this history just play out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bearing that in mind, what sort of lifestyle should Jewish Australians and those of any other religious or cultural group expect? They should expect rights and freedoms for all individuals; freedom of thought, worship, speech and association; the rule of law, safety, justice; and equality of opportunity, reward for effort and a fair go—at least, that's what the coalition believes in. Yet Labor's inaction is tearing our social cohesion apart. Antisemitism is like a wound that festers within communities. Without appropriate treatment it grows and causes destruction of the surrounding tissue, eroding community connections, relationships and values and pitting neighbours against each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While people in Mallee, my electorate, might think this is an urban issue, the reality is that I've been made aware of antisemitism in my own electorate. This is an issue not only in inner-city areas, where there are many Jewish people living in close proximity to each other, but also in rural and regional communities. In small rural and regional communities people often know each other and rely heavily on their social networks and connections, making festering antisemitism even more volatile. Jewish people in Mallee tell me they don't feel safe because of open antisemitism in the Australian community, including the display of blatantly antisemitic propaganda in public spaces within my rural and regional electorate. An Italian migrant complained to me recently that his family came to Australia in the 1950s and accepted Australian values, so why can't newer arrivals? The ability to understand and subscribe to Australian values is essential for social cohesion and maintaining our way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate the concern expressed by Victoria Police about rising antisemitism in Victoria. The Victorian Chief Commissioner recently articulated this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've seen a significant rise in antisemitism … It remains our biggest concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Patton said that, since the October 7 attack, more than 160 antisemitic incidents have been reported in Victoria. Accordingly, an increased police presence is now being deployed in Melbourne. Unfortunately, it does not seem this will extend to the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evil is always present, gently bubbling beneath the surface, and strong action must be taken to ensure it doesn't start to simmer, let alone boil. To further illustrate the fact that antisemitism is not just an issue in the cities, I highlight an instance of blatant public activity by a white supremacist group in Mallee in 2021. A group of about 30 men were seen performing Nazi salutes and chanting slogans such as 'white power' and 'heil Hitler' while camping and hiking in a national park—the mind boggles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is intended to help mitigate some of the government's failures. It modifies the existing offences in division 80 of the Criminal Code that should have been used to stop the spark of antisemitism in the first place. The existing offences in division 80 of the Criminal Code make it an offence to urge violence against individuals or groups on the basis of race, religion and the like. They make it an offence to advocate terrorism or genocide. For months, the coalition has been calling for the existing laws to be used. We have been saying that the existing offences should be tested and those preaching antisemitism should be put before a court. Why hasn't this happened?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless, the changes made by these laws as introduced are welcome. I only hope they will be enough to start to stem the tide. Inaction is no longer acceptable. The scourge of antisemitism in this country must be stopped.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I congratulate the member for Mallee on the fine speech that she's just given. I support the remarks that she's made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides of this House agree that our country is facing significant challenges when it comes to antisemitism and the breakdown in social cohesion. The Director-General of Security, in his 2024 threat assessment, warned the country of this growing threat. The previous coalition government invested in efforts to counter violent extremism and address the root causes and vehicles of radicalisation with strong leadership on online safety, education and mental health care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was Labor's response? What has been this government's response? Their response has been a divisive, race based referendum, funding for divisive organisations and a systematic campaign against Israel and the Jewish people. They have, however, created a position of the Special Envoy for Social Cohesion. Now, I've got nothing against the member for Wills—the member for Wills is a good bloke—but, in this position, this is typical of what this Prime Minister does: a bit of wallpaper, a fresh coat of paint and there's nothing to see here. He does these things. He creates positions like the Special Envoy for Social Cohesion to make out as though he's actually doing something when he's doing nothing, or, worse, when he's actually making the problem worse by his actions and his inactions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General said that this Labor government is committed to the safety and security of the community. Tell that to the people of Alice Springs; tell that to the Australian Border Force; tell that to victims of knife crime, child exploitation and domestic violence, who are paying the price for Labor's careless cuts and clueless government; tell that to Jewish students; tell that to the Jewish community who frequent synagogues; tell that to Jewish shopowners across the country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That goes to the heart of this issue. The reality is that Australia is facing an antisemitism crisis in which Jewish people and the Israeli diaspora are targeted because of who they are. They are targeted online and in the street through doxxing and abuse simply because of where they come from or what they believe. This is Australia in 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I'm going to hazard a guess that neither you nor I—certainly not I—would have thought even two years ago that we would be here where we are today. Scratch that very thin veneer and what we are seeing today is the worst kind of racial vilification—the oldest kind of racial vilification. It is up to every member of this House and the Senate, all leaders in the community across the states and territories and, in fact, every single Australian to call out antisemitism when and as we see it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the government is using the tactic that the opposition are somehow politicising this issue, but nothing could be further from the truth. What are the opposition to do when they see a total fundamental failure on the part of government in relation to its policies? Should the opposition just say: 'Well, we don't want to politicise this. We don't want to create an issue here. We don't want to draw any attention to the failure of government'? No. It's up to every single Australian to call out the failures of this government—and they are. This is not a Jewish problem; this is a problem that is impacting 27 million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very small Jewish community in my electorate. Whilst the Jewish community is growing, the Sunshine Coast has reportedly around a thousand Jewish people. It's very small, but I have people—everyday ordinary Australians; non-Jewish people—coming to me, stopping me in the street and saying: 'What is happening to Jews in Australia is unforgiveable. This is not the Australia that we know and love.' The crazies on the far left and the crazies on the far right seem to have created this confluence of unforgiveable behaviour, and it is up to every single Australian to call it out as we see it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This hate speech—this hate—has a new lick of paint and has rebranded, and it's a campaign that is called 'Zionism'. But, make no mistake, they are the same ancient tropes, lies and attitudes that have been repackaged to attack the Jewish people as they have for thousands of years. I think we need to be really clear about what Zionism is and give clarity to its definition, which this legislation is supposed to provide after all. UK TV personality and Holocaust educator Rachel Riley put it really well. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Zionism is the belief that Jews have the right to self-determination in their own country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anti-Zionism, in its proper def'n says that Jews, alone in the world, should not have their own nation state.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what this anti-Jewish hate, by its many names, has led to in this country since the October 7 attacks. Stores run by Jewish people have been vandalised. Nazi symbols and antisemitic vandalism have been spray-painted and carved into public spaces, including in Sippy Downs and Birtinya in my own community and right outside my office. Violent protests have spread from national monuments to regional towns, replete with terrorist slogans, the flags of hate groups and the portraits of dictators. School students, university students and academics have been targeted through protests, encampments, discrimination and hate filled conferences, including at local schools and at my own alma mater, QUT. I recently called on the education minister to stop funding QUT until an investigation was done into their actions in the most heinous conference, which was supposed to drive social cohesion—absolutely disgraceful. Not only should the people that ran and spoke at that conference be condemned; the leadership of QUT, where I did my law degree, should be condemned. This government needs to muscle up, put its money where its mouth is and start taking action against organisations that drive antisemitism, like the Queensland University of Technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we saw the Adass Israel synagogue firebombed in Melbourne, in scenes that were reminiscent of the Kristallnacht in November 1938. This year, unforgivably, a childcare centre in Sydney near a Jewish school and synagogue was torched. That childcare centre was not Jewish run. It just happened to be near a synagogue and a Jewish school. Thanks to the efforts of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, a catastrophic terror attack was prevented in Sydney last week. That terrorist attack had the potential to be the worst domestic terrorism event in Australian history. Reportedly, there were enough explosives for there to have been a 40-metre blast zone—almost the length of a 50-metre Olympic swimming pool. Inside that caravan was a list of Jewish synagogues and sites. I do congratulate Chris Minns and the New South Wales police force on their work in relation to this, but our political leadership and our senior police and law enforcement agencies' leadership has been found wanting. It has been wanting since October 9, when we saw those disgraceful scenes on the steps of Sydney Opera House. Those scenes were left unchecked. And when these things are left unchecked, it becomes a progressive series of events where people think they can get away with something and they'll keep pushing the envelope—pushing, pushing, pushing—until we start to see the firebombing of synagogues and childcare centres. There is a very real risk that someone will be killed as a result of these appalling antisemitic actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all very well and good for the Prime Minister to make mealy-mouthed comments, but what we have seen is a systemic attack on Israel and the Jewish people which has fuelled antisemitism in Australia. The government can't have it both ways. The Prime Minister can't stand up and say he's doing all these wonderful things and then lead the charge in the United Nations against Israel. That is unacceptable. Israel is our ally. It is the only democracy in the Middle East, and the Australian government has abandoned Israel. We are seeing insidious Neo-Nazi extremism moving from the dark recesses of the internet onto regularly used apps, web platforms and indeed our streets. I think that, above all things, this is a crisis in leadership from a government which has, as I said, systematically campaigned against Israel and the Jewish people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow foreign minister and my good friend the member for Berowra, I outlined yesterday many of Labor's failures. I note that, in his second reading speech, the Attorney-General only referenced antisemitism once and only in tandem with Islamophobia. For many months Labor ministers have proved incapable of acknowledging the scourge of domestic antisemitism without mentioning Islamophobia, as if one somehow offsets the other. Yes, people of all faiths are contending with the rise in extremism. The Islamic community, the Christian community, Hindus, Sikhs and minority faith groups are all paying the price for Labor's social cohesion crisis. This legislation is an important step forward, but it is too little, too late. That should be the slogan of Labor's approach in office: too little, too late. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. I confess that, as a member of the 47th Parliament, I can't help but feel the incredible weight that comes with debating what is quite an extraordinary piece of legislation in our nation's history. That our society has reached a point where we must put in place laws to protect individuals and groups from hate speech is a very sad indictment on the direction in which we are headed. Yet here we are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the person the community of North Sydney sent to parliament to represent them during this term, I ask you to hear me when I say the people who surround me in my community every day share a common belief that all of us have the right to feel safe, to be treated with respect and to participate in our society without fear of vilification and discrimination based on our individual characteristics. If realising that ambition means we need to move laws like this, then we will support that legislation wholeheartedly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, however, we will also ensure our day-to-day actions are driven by common values that are not just practised to ensure we stay within the boundaries of the law but are practically lived on a daily basis to ensure everyone feels included. We will also continue to work to bring those that are currently outliers to this ambition back into line, even as we are called 'woke'. Much to all our shame, there are people currently living in Australia who are subject to hate speech and vilification. To quote the Human Rights Law Centre:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Far right hate and extremism is on the rise. Women wearing the hijab have been assaulted by men in the street, while men wearing the kippah have been met with the white power salute. We have seen rallies held against trans rights, and neo-nazis intimidating refugee activists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This cannot continue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently it has been heartbreaking to see so many disgusting instances of blatant antisemitism targeting Jewish businesses, individuals and places of worship. These acts are abhorrent, and there is absolutely no place for them in this country. In this context then, it's clear we need stronger measures to prevent and address hate crimes in Australia. While I can wish that it had not been necessary, I believe this legislation will certainly play a valuable role in our overall response to this challenge. But, as we've heard from human rights organisations and community groups, it cannot be our only response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the changes to hate speech laws in the bill before us, there is also a clear need for measures that not only address actual violence but ultimately stop vilification of groups before it even begins. There's also a clear need for a long-term national antiracism framework in Australia, including a national hate crimes database and greater funding for the prevention of extremism, because, ultimately, if we can't name it and track it, we will never be able to adequately understand where it comes from or what is driving it. Informing all of these responses is a need for a national human rights framework that ensures hate speech and discrimination laws and policies are grounded in a common, irrefutable and legislated understanding of minimum human rights for all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us broadens the offences for urging violence against either members of specific groups or entire groups themselves to include groups distinguished by sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. It would also broaden this offence to capture recklessness, rather than just intent, and remove the availability of the good faith defence. The bill does this by creating a new offence for directly threatening force or violence towards a group or a group member. Finally the bill would expand the existing offences against the public display of Nazi or terrorist symbols used to humiliate or intimidate a group to include groups distinguished by sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Many of these measures have been advocated for by a broad cross-section of our society for a very long time, including advocates for the LGBTQIA+ community and, more recently, the Jewish community. I thank the government for finally heeding that advocacy and bringing this reform into law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, I'm concerned the bill doesn't do enough to adequately address the threats faced by a multitude of communities. Particular concern has been raised around the absence of an offence that specifically targets serious vilification of protected groups. As one North Sydney resident expressed to me: 'the current bill won't protect me, or other LGBTQIA+ people, against serious vilification—the promotion of hatred that can be the spark which leads to violence will not be stopped. We need stronger, broader protections that operate nationally to protect all of us, including other communities impacted by prejudice-motivated speech and violence.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the member for Wentworth that would create a new criminal offence for public acts performed with the intention and likely outcome of promoting hatred towards a targeted person or group. Her amendment would close a current potential loophole where a person hasn't explicitly urged violence but is nonetheless engaging in serious vilification. I recognise this as potentially quite an extraordinary inclusion in a piece of legislation. I think we're living in extraordinary times, in which extraordinary actions are required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment moved by the member for Wentworth has been advocated for strongly by Equality Australia and supported in principle by the Human Rights Commission. In considering all of these approaches to tackling hatred and discrimination, however, I share the caution of many human rights groups that legislation targeting hate crimes must be carefully calibrated to ensure we avoid overpolicing and/or inadvertently capturing the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression. In the case of this legislation, we have heard criticism from certain groups that the legislation doesn't take enough care in weighing up competing human rights. For instance, the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I'm a member, noted that it is currently unclear whether this bill's limitations on the rights to freedom of expression, religion and non-discrimination would be proportionate in all circumstances. The committee further highlights the risk that in practice these offences could capture a range of conduct, the prohibition of which could constitute an unjustifiable limit on the rights to freedom of expression. These concerns extend to the removal of the good faith defence, which would eliminate any legal recourse for individuals who fall foul of this law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Human Rights Commission questions whether expressive speech during unpopular or divisive public protest could be viewed as incitement against protected groups. If so, legislation such as this disproportionally impact groups that engage in protest to have their voices heard, such as First Nations people. Given this concern, while I ultimately support this bill, I also believe it is imperative that we are able to answer these questions, as they are reflective of a recurring problem that we have in Australian lawmaking as we struggle to weigh up freedom of expression against the right to safety, freedom from discrimination and other rights. While I acknowledge much of what is included here in the member for Wentworth's amendment is already in practice in WA, I would assert that applying this thinking from the federal level down warrants a degree of certainty for those whose primary concern is the protection of free speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I also can't help but take this opportunity to again assert that many of the concerns that have prompted the introduction of this legislation today would have been avoided if we had a federal human rights act. As one of the only developed nations in the world not to have a human rights act, we continue to be hamstrung by a piecemeal system that relies on applying bandaids to close gaps rather than being guided by a well-articulated framework that recognises our responsibilities and duties towards other people and our community as a whole. Ultimately, individuals bear the responsibility to ensure that they exercise their rights with due regard for the rights of others. For example, exercising freedom of speech should never infringe on somebody else's rights to privacy, nor should it infringe on their right to safety. Recognising and respecting fundamental human rights are a part of the context of people living together in societies. As part of this, there must be legal, social and international order for human rights to be realised effectively. As the Law Council of Australia notes in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… articulating … limitations on multiple rights could be navigated in a more coherent way through a federal Human Rights Act and Human Rights Framework. In the absence of a Human Rights Act … assessments for Bills … are being conducted in a legislative vacuum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another challenge we face is the lack of a coherent national approach to tackling racism in Australia. Again, as the member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights I have recently had the privilege of being involved in public hearings looking at the prevalence and experience of antisemitism in our universities. This has involved listening directly to students as they've shared their experience of the rise in antisemitic sentiment on campuses and the fear and abuse they have experienced. In these hearings the committee has heard from many groups that there is an urgent need to address racism and religious discrimination more broadly in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of Australians reporting a negative attitude towards Jewish people rose by four per cent in the past year, and this is truly shocking. But, further to that, negative attitudes towards Muslims have risen by seven per cent, leading the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute to report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… while attitudes to Australia's Muslim and Jewish communities is a particular area of concern, relations towards and across all faiths appear to be under pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard from the Australian Human Rights Commission's interim report on racism at Australian universities that Jewish students and staff cited a rise in antisemitism, including extremist propaganda and intimidation. At the same time First Nations students have reported enduring structural and interpersonal racism whilst Arab and African students reported frequently encountering severe racism, and Muslim students and staff described hostility, threats and discriminatory practices. Where are we going?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This message does not diminish the need to specifically call and address antisemitism, and nor should it, but it does add a sobering dynamic that makes it clear we need to tackle all forms of discrimination, racism and radicalisation in Australia. Ultimately the messages from the experts are clear: we need a holistic national approach to these challenges that tackles them from the ground up. In this vein the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia called on the government to provide additional specific long-term funding for a national antiracism framework. A federal framework like this would allow us to look beyond one-off projects and reactive legislation and provide monitoring, evaluation and strategic planning to tackle racism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key part of this framework needs to be the establishment of a national hate crimes database, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Currently, state and federal police, and by consequence policymakers in the wider community, don't have a shared resource to track and monitor hate crimes across the country. Australia is one of the few countries without a national database, with the USA, Canada and the UK all collecting hate motivated crime data. Without a complete understanding of these crimes and their prevalence, our attempts to address them are in danger of being misinformed and misdirected and fundamentally informed by poor media commentary rather than the facts. The National Cabinet's recent announcement of a national antisemitism database is an important first step, but I do encourage the government to consider the expansion of this program to capture all hate crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it's apparent that even though this bill's measures to address hate symbols and incitements to violence are important, we need systems of early intervention to prevent radicalisation and extremism before they even take seed. Criminalisation is one lever we can use to address extremist views and behaviours, but it shouldn't be either the only one or, in my own personal opinion, the primary one. It's not enough to put out fires; we need to stop them from ever being lit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One proposal is the national delivery of community based prevention and rehabilitation programs. These programs could identify at-risk or radicalised individuals and provide them with an off-ramp from extremism. Again, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils suggests schools are critical for educating and inoculating our young people from racism, yet where are the resources for them? Students need to be educated on racism and its harms, as well as diversity as a positive feature of Australian life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I've not met a single person in my community who does not believe that all Australians deserve to live in a country where they don't have to fear discrimination, hatred or violence because of their identity, and who is not shocked by the direction our country seems to have been sliding towards over the course of the three years since this parliament first sat. But for us to realise that ambition, we're going to need to go further than penalties for hate crimes. We need a long-term national antiracism framework informed by robust debates and supported regardless of which side of politics you stand on. We need early interventions to prevent the spread of racism and the invoking of extremism, and we need a federal human rights framework to allow for a coherent approach to fairly balance competing rights and freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community welcomes this bill, but it needs to be the beginning of a much larger movement to create an Australia that lives up to its values of tolerance, equality and respect for all.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 but also to seek this parliament's support in passing my amendments to address some of the remaining deficiencies in the act. In recent weeks and months, my community of Wentworth has witnessed a horrifying increase in antisemitic incidents. These violent and destructive attacks have targeted houses, vehicles, places of worship and even a childcare centre. Almost daily, the Jewish community is being violently targeted by criminals. These attacks target Jewish Australians, but they have frightened my whole community; my whole community is frightened. People in Wentworth have been forced to install additional security cameras, dread going away or leaving their kids home alone and now live in a community patrolled 24/7 by police helicopters. A woman spoke to me recently, saying she was meant to be going overseas for a wedding—a very important, personal reason—but she was very afraid to leave her adult daughter at home because of what was happening. It is overwhelming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an Australia I recognise. Yesterday, I was very proud to put forward and get support from the entire parliament in the House and the Senate on a motion that unanimously acknowledged the insidious rise of antisemitism in Australia and condemned it unequivocally. I think that is absolutely critical. This is why, to be honest, I have been working hard in the parliament and in my community—to make a real difference on antisemitism. Some of the things I've been focused on include, firstly, getting the right people there. I'm lobbying very hard and delivering Australia's first antisemitism envoy. I'm calling to make sure that the laws are right. I called for, and we've successfully delivered in this parliament, strong antidoxxing laws and the outlawing of Nazi symbols and gestures. I helped make sure security services are right by ensuring we deliver tens of millions of dollars of enhanced security for the Jewish community and also by making sure that the policing is coordinated. I was calling for a national approach to policing, which the government announced before Christmas, and I meet every single week with Strike Force Pearl in Sydney, as well as with my local police, to understand what is happening in terms of policing and make sure the policing is right for the community that I'm facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also been pushing to make sure that education is right. There are two elements. One has been advocating for and seeing the success of $8.5 million given to the Sydney Jewish Museum, because that is a critical facility for educating people in this space. I have invited every single high school in my electorate to come together to talk about antisemitism and hear the testimonies of the Jewish schools about what they're doing and feeling and how we can better make sure the whole community and the young people in it are standing up against antisemitism. I also think a critical part has been around community cohesion. We have invited all the faith leaders of Wentworth together to talk about the mutual problems and challenges faced by faith leaders and to share some of those challenges with each other and build that community. Finally, I've worked very closely with the Australian Union of Jewish Students to put pressure specifically on university vice-chancellors to stamp out antisemitism at the university. I was doing that work before 7 October with my colleagues the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, Josh Burns and Julian Leeser.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This work is ongoing and absolutely critical. It's a huge part of what I do in parliament, and that is because I'm really concerned about the rise in antisemitism. I was concerned before 7 October. And I can see the impact on my community every single day. This impact isn't just the violent occurrences. I've run student forums every single term and invite students from all my schools together. I always have two students from all my schools together to talk about issues. In one forum very recently, two students talked about their experience of antisemitism in the streets of my community. They were walking down the street. Someone saw that they had Jewish school uniforms. The car slowed down and did a heil Hitler sign and swore about the Jewish people. That's what the kids in my community are dealing with, and it is absolutely shocking. The day before yesterday I spoke to a friend of mine whose kids are a similar age—young primary school kids—and he said: 'It's getting really hard. We're trying to shield our kids from the antisemitism, but they don't understand why there are police constantly outside the schools, or why the guards have increased. They don't understand why they can't go on excursions anymore, why they're not playing sport with others, or why they're being told not to wear the school uniform in certain public places.' This is absolutely tragic. I am proud the parliament unified against yesterday to say that we condemn this antisemitism, but we need to collectively be taking strong action. This legislation is part of the strong action that we need to take, as well as stronger sentencing, stronger policing, education and making sure those who have perpetrated these crimes are actually prosecuted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me come to the legislation. Whether we like it or not, the community is looking to us as lawmakers to draw a clear line in the sand. Australia has, for many decades, struggled with balancing freedom of speech and the protection of safety and civil liberties. Striking such a balance is no trivial issue. But today, overseas conflicts, polarising political debates and leaders, and tough economic conditions, mixed in with the apparently anonymous impunity of the internet and social media, have created an environment in which hate and division are festering. Australia's social cohesion is showing not only cracks but also chasms. While we have strict criminal laws against things like destruction of property and vandalism, and the perpetrators behind these crimes are being pursued by law enforcement, these incidents are not random. They're not isolated. They're the result of the festering hatred and animosity that is first allowed to germinate in dark corners of the internet and chat rooms, gradually manifesting in speeches, gestures and placards, until it ultimately spews out onto the streets in acts of violence. It is the cumulative impact of insidious, vitriolic statements, slogans and expressions that have absolutely nothing to do with robust debate, the exchange of ideas or the scrutiny of power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you some examples. In March 2023, protesters at an anti-trans rally held signs calling to destroy 'paedo freaks'. The royal commission into disability outlined instances of people's photos being posted online for the purpose of drawing vile comments and public humiliation. In 2023, an online sermon called for the final solution in relation to the Jews, echoing the words of Hitler. These acts have a very human element to the people who they're targeted towards, and demonstrate a clear gap in our legal framework. As the director of security at ASIO, Mike Burgess, repeatedly said: words matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me move on to the changes and their deficiencies. Within this context it is commendable that legislation has been brought forward by the government. The current bill will modestly improve the existing federal Crimes Act by lowering the fault element for existing offences from intent to recklessness, as well as by introducing a new offence for threatening force or violence. But we should be listening more carefully when the people and groups that this legislation is designed to protect continue to protest its inadequacy. This was amply highlighted by the submissions to the Senate inquiry. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry highlighted in their submission that despite gradual changes over time to the Criminal Code:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there remains an environment of relative impunity with respect to the promotion, advocacy or glorification of racial and religious hatred and violence …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equality Australia and Rainbow Families, representing the LGBTQIA+ community, stated that, in addition to protections against targeted threats of violence, federal regulation needs to 'hold hate to account and prevent it spreading'. People with Disability Australia expressed disappointment that 'this bill does not criminalise serious forms of vilification perpetrated against targeted groups, as originally intended'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these communities and others, the amendments the government has put forward are positive, but they do not go to the heart of hate, the promotion of hate and the impact that it has on our society. They make illegal only the most extreme acts—if, indeed, they can ever be proven beyond reasonable doubt—but do nothing against the tidal wave of hatred, abuse and harassment that people in our community are subjected to daily. Incidents that make them feel insecure, unsafe and unwelcome in their own home, in their own country, and in the place they were born. Enough is enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our federal law is inadequate and our state and racial vilification acts represent a hodgepodge of overlapping legislation that creates different classes of offences and different standards of proof depending on where you reside in Australia. In the internet age, when state borders are irrelevant to the flow of information, this just isn't going to cut it. Legal and human rights organisations have acknowledged that we have a gaping hole in our legal framework, and I and many others believe it's time for a nationally consistent approach. That is why I am moving an amendment to this bill that will create a new offence of serious vilification and promotion of hatred, and I urge this parliament to support my amendment. I'm also suggesting in the amendment that the term 'intersex status' be replaced with 'sex characteristics' to better reflect the preference of the LGBTIQ community and the direction of not only various state laws but also international human rights recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that this is a really difficult area to legislate, and I am not naive to the challenges. People are rightly concerned about the protection of freedom of speech in such a robust and flourishing democracy as we have here, and so am I. But let me make some reassurances. This amendment will not remove your right to speak freely or to protest. How do we have some certainty around this? The amendment is based on legislation that has been in WA for the last 20 years. In fact the Western Australian crimes act has had a similar offence for the last 21 years. It's these sections—sections 77 and 78 from chapter 11 of the WA Criminal Code—that are actually the inspiration for my amendment. The provisions in the WA Criminal Code have not resulted in the curtailing of free speech in WA. They have not led to censorship. But they have put behind bars people who would seek to stoke hatred. In 2011 a Western Australian man, Brendon O'Connell, was found guilty under the new section 77 of harassing a young Jewish man in 2009. But, to demonstrate the law's necessary limitations, there are also precedents where these sections have been rejected in instances of minor offensive slurs, because that is not the intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about this point a bit further because this is really critical. The amendments I have put forward are designed to stop the promotion of hatred and the promotion of harassment—the people who are out there promoting it. To be convicted of this, it has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is our highest evidentiary proof, that you had the intention to promote hatred in the community. That is a really high bar, and I genuinely believe it is appropriately so. When people ask me about the concerns about free speech, which I acknowledge, I say, 'Look, do we want people who are intending to promote hatred?' That is their goal. Is that something that we should be protecting without any guardrails? Or should we also be considering what happens to vulnerable communities when people are promoting and really intending to increase hatred against a group and there is little recourse that these individuals have—certainly not under the criminal code? That is a real challenge and a real question. Australia has always had some appropriate restrictions on free speech. Defamation law is one of them. You can't defame somebody. There are all sorts of things. There are appropriate guardrails around this, and I think we need to be really clear on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I value our incredibly diverse community of people from all parts of the world. Fifty per cent of our country either was born overseas or had a parent born overseas. My family is half-half—half born here; half born overseas—when it comes to my parents. Australia has every religion, we have so many different languages spoken at home and we are welcoming of people of different sexualities and genders. This is the country that we're trying to protect, and I really question whether people trying to promote hatred in different groups in our community should go unfettered. I think there should be guardrails around this, and that is why I am seeking support from the parliament on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in our country we will often disagree vehemently. We will disagree over conflicts overseas. We're a multicultural nation and we will always have people on different sides of any conflict, but I do see that my community is unified in the sense that they do not stand for hate and intimidation of others based on their religion, sexuality, ethnic background or ability status. That cannot be tolerated in this society. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  All democratic governments have to balance the freedom to express cultural and religious opinions with the competing need to ensure their citizens' freedom from discrimination. I'm concerned that, given the time pressures on this parliament, the Albanese government is rushing consideration of a really difficult and complex piece of legislation and, in doing so, has doomed this legislation to outlaw hate crimes in this country to failure. Between 2017 and 2021, under the previous government, we saw a series of inquiries and proposals to introduce protections against religious discrimination. That process ended with the unsuccessful Religious Discrimination Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, this government promised to introduce legal protections for religious beliefs but also to legislate to protect teachers and students from discrimination. Despite that promise, the Prime Minister indicated during this term that the government would not proceed with that religious discrimination reform without bipartisan support, and it has not done so. I felt that that was appropriate. I think that bipartisan support is really important for these important pieces of public policy, which brings us to this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024, aimed as it is at combating the increasing antisemitism and Islamophobia which have been evident in Australian society since 7 October 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last 16 months have been a time of untold tragedy in the Middle East. The actions of Hamas on 7 October 2023, and the subsequent response by the Israeli government, have resulted in enormous human loss and suffering in Israel, in Gaza and in the other occupied territories. Australia's Jewish community felt the loss, the shock and the horror of October 7 immediately and profoundly. For so many, these events have affected their family members, their friends and their loved ones in Australia but also in Israel. In recent months, the increasing wave of antisemitism in this country has compounded their trauma and their grief. Australian Jews have had to deal with racially based hatred of a degree and an extent previously unknown to them, although many have told me that antisemitism is, sadly, not new to them. The trauma of these last 16 months has exacerbated their received memory—the buried but ever-present intergenerational impact of the Holocaust on diasporic Jewish communities—while it has also created a new trauma in which they have seen an upending of the very reasonable assumption that the past is the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That new knowledge, that understanding that antisemitism is a real, present, confronting and constant issue in Australia today, has traumatised the Australian Jewish community. It has shocked those of us that are not Jewish but stand with those that are and reject and abhor this most ancient of hatreds. In many respects, it feels as though our society's capacity for respectful dialogue and empathy has been lost. Our understanding and tolerance, our support for other families in our communities and our gratitude for the many cultures and histories which contribute to our rich social fabric seem strained and difficult. It seems that we no longer have common ground where we have had it before. Our accepting communities seemed to have hardened. They've become less generous and less inclusive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, rather than acting in a bipartisan and respectful way around these difficult times, many have chosen to politicise and weaponise the horrific events of October 7, the ongoing plight of the hostages and their families, the tragic impact of the Israeli government's response upon innocent Palestinian civilians and the ongoing grief and trauma of those who watch from afar. Politicisation of this tragedy has made no-one safer; rather, it has exacerbated the anxiety and the fear felt by so many. I therefore supported yesterday's motion in parliament to deplore the appalling and unacceptable rise in antisemitism in Australia, including attacks on synagogues, schools, homes and childcare centres. I unequivocally condemn and reject antisemitism and racism in all of their forms, as I condemn similar hate directed to any group in our community. Jewish Australians should not, and no Australians should, have to live with discrimination and vilification based on their religion. I call on all of my colleagues in this place to support this rejection of hatred and ignorance and to express solidarity with our Jewish Australian brothers and sisters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's Muslim community has also been affected by an increase in religious and culturally motivated hate speech. I think of the constituent who came to my office and told me that she cannot and will not speak of such things publicly because, on the only occasion that she did, she was labelled a terrorist by her friends. I think of the mum who brought her two small children to my electorate office not long after October 7. They told me that they were really worried for their cousins in Gaza. These small children were sad because they felt that this country didn't care about them or about their loss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's anti-islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, has already reported that Islam is associated in the media and in the majority of the public mind with radicalism, extremism and terrorism. He has reported that Islamophobia is normalised in Australia but that it is underreported, and that violence, hatred and discrimination against Muslims are widespread daily realities in this country. So I call on my colleagues in this place to also reject that hatred and that ignorance and to express solidarity with our Muslim Australian brothers and sisters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The events of the last 16 months firstly led to the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023, which I supported when we legislated it in 2023. The new and additional measures included in the bill now before the House are a further response to the increasing prevalence of hate speech and hateful conduct in our society. The bill extends protections to groups defined by race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, or political opinion to add sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status—which is an outmoded terminology, and I agree with the member for Wentworth that it should be altered to 'sexual characteristics'—and disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill as presented to this parliament has actually stepped back from the government's initial plan, which was to criminalise religious hate speech; instead, conduct will be criminalised only where it involves threats of force or violence. We do have to maintain a balance between the freedom of expression and protecting the Australian community from discrimination and hate. We have to have carefully framed laws which proscribe speech and inciting radicalisation and violence. While protection of freedom of expression is crucial in certain circumstances, that right has to be subject to limitation, and that includes advocacy of hatred, which constitutes incitement to discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Kooyong constituents have described to me in recent months how they feel that the federal laws we have passed in this place are not being enforced in Melbourne and that they no longer feel safe in our city on weekends. I have responded by asking the federal and state attorneys-general to clarify their attitudes to these and to other concerns, including the ongoing protests in the city of Melbourne every weekend. It's frustrating that just this week in Victorian parliament the Liberal opposition has voted against legislation which is similar to that now before this house. The fact that we have a hodgepodge melange of ineffective state and federal legislations around these matters is frustrating for people who are most concerned by them. The public deserves to understand and feel protected by our laws. They need to know they will be enforced; otherwise, our actions here and those of our state governments are pointless. But our responsibility to the public is also to ensure that any limitations that we put on their ability to gather peacefully, and to express their ideas and opinions, are necessary, precise, and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's unclear to what extent this legislation currently in front of the House will be impactful. I note there have been no prosecutions or convictions in the 35 years since New South Wales criminalised vilification involving threats of physical harm or property damage. These new Commonwealth offences have complex definitions. It will be challenging to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a responsibility to identify and understand the drivers that are attracting people to the far right and to act in the ways we are attempting to address with the legislation currently before the House. The horrific firebombing of the Adass Israel synagogue in Ripponlea in Melbourne was a terrorist attack. So too were the two attacks on synagogues in Sydney and the horrifying recent attack on a childcare centre in Sydney. The finding of a caravan packed with explosives shocked the whole country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passing legislation of the sort currently before the House will not stop those sorts of activities. We have to do more to understand who is committing these crimes, what motivates them and how we can cut antisemitism and other forms of racism off at the roots. Passage of these laws in the House today will not stop those forms of mindless violence. We have to do better as a nation. We have to work to find what binds us and not what divides us. We have to say publicly and repeatedly, in the face of hate speech, 'No, never again.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I am quite sad to be rising in the Federation Chamber to have to speak on a bill such as this. The Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 is a necessary bill to come before this parliament, but it should be very unnecessary. In 2025 we shouldn't have to pass a bill such as this. We shouldn't have to be discussing this in parliament when there are so many other issues at hand which are placing such pressure on Australians. We should be discussing matters of the economy, matters of the environment and matters of defence, but instead we are here spending an inordinate amount of time discussing something that should not be necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I came to parliament this morning and was stopped by a red light. Across the road, a woman walked, brandishing, rather proudly, a Palestinian flag. That is okay; she is free to do that. We live in a democracy. But the number of Palestinian flags that are being waved and the amount of hatred that is coming out across the nation are beyond belief. It's not just in capital cities. Just before the former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg presented his very good documentary last year, I spoke to him, as I do every week. I spoke to him about the fact that this isn't just something confined to Sydney and Melbourne. This is right across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I'm sad to say that, in my hometown of Wagga Wagga, the antisemitism is rife. And it should not be so. We have a fellow who, in his Fitzmaurice Street shopfront window, displays words and images I would not repeat here. The constituents of my electorate and visitors to Wagga Wagga file daily into my electorate office on the same street—on the next block, just up the road from where this shopfront is—complaining every day. The same people go to our local police station just around the corner on Tarcutta Street and complain. Yet the police say there's nothing they can do given the laws that we have. It is apparently okay to display, in huge letters, four-letter words that should not be seen—not be seen by children with impressionable minds and not be seen by adults. Yet, every week, he comes up with a new image and a new form of words. If that isn't antisemitism, then I don't know what is. Yet our police are apparently powerless to stop this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituents complain to me, and I have to say I'm probably the only community leader in Wagga who has been game enough and brave enough to say something about it. I have copped it. I have copped it from him. I have copped it on social media. I've got this group of people who call themselves 'Sundays for Peace', who up until just recently—indeed up until Australia Day—were meeting every Sunday. I won't say 'meeting'; I'll say 'protesting'. Admittedly, there have been gatherings where twice my office has been daubed with unnecessary posters and unnecessary images and artwork, which I'd call graffiti. I've gone to the police twice, and, again, the police say they're powerless because I'm a public figure. Yet, if I went round and daubed this person's shopfront window with slogans and material that he found offensive, I would be charged, and the police have told me that. The police have also told me, 'It would be best if you didn't go to your electorate office at the same time on a Sunday,' because of these people. I have spoken to the Prime Minister, and he has told me that he hasn't been able to go to his Newtown electorate office because of the same sort of situation, the same sorts of protestors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They used to call themselves 'Fridays for Future'. When we were in government and I was the Deputy Prime Minister, they were protesting about the climate. But you know what? When Labor took over, apparently the climate altered for the better. Everything was good again, and then, of course, we had October 7 2023, that day of infamy. Not long after that, the protestors arrived. Initially, I went out to greet them, as I always would, to talk to them rationally and sensibly about what they were protesting. I always do that. I was shouted down. I was told that I was cheering on—and I stopped this fellow short before he could say 'the murder of children', but that was what they'd suggested a little prior to that. Then, when I arced up and said, 'That is not the case. I have said publicly that a Palestinian baby is every bit as innocent as an Israeli baby,' they weren't satisfied with that. When I was challenging them on that precept, they said, 'Well, the Prime Minister is cheering on the murders.' I said: 'No, no—the Prime Minister has not said that. He has not uttered those words, and you should not say that.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then they found it necessary to go to an animal remembrance military commemoration in the Victory Memorial Gardens, of all things. They decided to take their protest there knowing that I was there and that there would be media. They were waving their Palestinian flags in front of the Light Horse re-enactment troop, getting in the way and getting up in people's faces with their mobile phones to take photos. Someone asked me to call the police, and I did. I wasn't the first one to call the police, but I did call the police, and the police came. As I was walking back through the park with my wife and family, I was yelled at. They said: 'Baby killer! Baby killer!' I won't cop that, but I had to. I turned, and all I said was: 'I have not ever said that. I have only ever said in the parliament that an Israeli and Palestinian baby are both born innocent and that they deserve all the peace and freedom that children are entitled to.' That wasn't good enough. They still screamed at me. A couple of days later, there was a letter to the editor of the Wagga <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Advertiser</span> saying that I had screamed at them, and they've continued this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next time I happened to be near my electorate office on a Sunday, again, they were yelling: 'Baby killer! Baby killer!' This is not Wagga Wagga, and yet, because I've objected, I'm somehow the subject of their remarks. I can cop that; I'm big enough. My shoulders are broad enough; it's water off a duck's back. But that should not be happening in Wagga Wagga. They've had marches down the main street where they've talked about the killing of babies, and they're only one sided. It is antisemitism. I don't care what anybody says. They'll probably read this speech in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>and I'll be the subject of their derision again. Well, go your hardest, seriously!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulty is that they do make such a protest. We've got a fellow in the local paper, Ray Goodlass, who writes a weekly column—sometimes it's more than weekly—and only ever presents one side of the argument, the pro-Palestinian argument. Their columns are so biased. And that's all the Wagga Wagga people are subjected to. They don't hear the other side unless it comes from me. That is a problem because, if you keep chipping away, people start to think, 'Well, maybe they're right,' and they're not right. They are wrong. They are absolutely wrong because it is antisemitism, and these shopfront displays and flagrant displays of antisemitism ought to stop. The police ought to have powers to make that happen. I am a big believer in free speech, but this is out of control. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made comments about Sheikh Abdulghani Albaf, the new principal of the New Madinah College at Young, in the South West Slopes in the Riverina electorate, who has made some highly inappropriate remarks on social media. He talked about when I first objected to his posts and a letter I had written to a constituent from Young. In the posts he wrote and in the comments on his social media he described me as 'human look like animal' and invoked 'Allah the best disposer'. This is not Australia. Don't bring your problems to our country. We can't solve the Middle East crisis from Fitzmaurice Street in Wagga Wagga, the streets of Sydney or indeed the steps of the Opera House. We cannot. This country has a proud multicultural history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Riverina is, I believe, the cradle of multiculturalism. Heaven knows we brought so many people from so many disparate and desperate nations to turn a desert into a fertile Garden of Eden, which we now call the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. They worked together—people from all nations in Europe who had not that long before been fighting with weapons. These days some people fight with words, and they convince Australians to do so too. Sadly, that is why we need legislation such as this. It's so that we can combat words and we can right the wrongs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't have to pass legislation like this, but the words uttered on 9 October on the steps of the Opera House—I have to say, I felt sorry for the police. I know that they listened to the tapes and came out with a view that what was suggested was said against the Jews wasn't, but we all know it was. We all know that they hate the Jews. Why people hate Jewish people I can't comprehend. I just cannot comprehend it, and I can't comprehend it in a society such as Australia, where we welcome people from all nationalities, all faiths and all orientations. We do, we should and we will go on doing that, but the comments by the sheik, who is now the principal of New Madinah College at Young—he needs to turn his language down. I've said so and I've been castigated for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sundays for Peace, who are now meeting only once a month, shouldn't be meeting at all. Heaven help us if they actually spent their time working for St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare or some other organisation. Their hours would be much better spent and the Wagga Wagga community would be far better off if they did that rather than wasting their time perhaps waiting for me to visit my electorate office on a Sunday so they can scream abuse at me. I won't cop people screaming abuse at my wife, Catherine. I will not do that. I come to this place willingly, and it's a great honour and a great privilege, but my family should not be subjected to the sort of abuse that they rain down upon us. She's big enough and tough enough to withstand that as well, but it is certainly so unnecessary. My staff shouldn't have to clean up the office when they decide to put their posters up with thick glue on the back. That shouldn't have to happen. Our police should have powers to tap them on the shoulder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fellow, Michael Agzarian, denied doing it, yet, when the police said, 'Is this is you on the CCTV?' he had to admit it was him. That is the sort of people they are. It has to stop, because Wagga Wagga is a wonderful community. I say it's the best place to live in all of Australia. Of course I would; I'm biased. I love the place. I was born there. I've lived in and around Wagga Wagga all my life. It should not be a place for antisemitic comments and a group, which meets only once a month on Sunday, that is quite frankly just another branch of the Greens. The Greens have a lot to answer for in this whole debate. The Greens have a lot to answer for regarding the divisive activities that have occurred right across our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel sorry that the Prime Minister can't go to his electorate office because of these actions. I do believe that the Prime Minister should have been stronger earlier on this issue, but he wasn't. But he shouldn't be subjected to the sort of rubbish that he has been. Nor should it happen in Wagga Wagga. As I say, it's not just the capital cities; it is right across the nation. It has to stop. The Jews have actually done a lot for our nation. They are Australians, and we, and all Australians, should support them.</span>

That's an absolute disgrace. When I was at the University of New England, my old alma mater, there was a quote by Caius Cornelius Tacitus, 'Ex sapientia modus,' which is, 'From wisdom comes moderation.' Moderation, of course, is an incredibly important thing. Why would Tacitus be so enthralled by moderation? Because moderation is what keeps people in harmonious relationships with one another. People don't get hurt when we have tolerance and when we rely on differences, but we don't take it to a point where we are prepared to do harm to another person—tolerance from moderation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a family who all served in the Defence Forces—both of my grandfathers and my father. Tragically my grandmother was English. We're not quite sure—they came from the Midlands, so it was a depressing process—but I think seven brothers were killed. They were all killed—all the boys. All gone. So impressed upon me from a young age was moderation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are evils of those who live in the shadows of the extremes on either side of the political fence, the Left and the Right, and the absolute horrendous mechanism of hate that they enthral the masses with for the destruction of people. We saw it in its most profound and evil form in the events that followed 1938 and probably started with the 1933 social service act of Germany, where they decided the path and that they were going to start with the exclusion of a certain race of people—Jewish people. What they worked on the back of was the political, social, economic and ethical malaise that was so evident in the Great Depression. With the promulgation of an ethos that worked on the back of that, they had the capacity to therefore target a certain group of people and place on their heads the profound problems that were there in Europe, especially the hyperinflation and economic destruction in Germany that followed the First World War. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course it was the art of evil. It wasn't a group of people that brought that about. You could probably go back to the economic circumstances of the armistice that brought that about. What was the purpose of this evil that came forward? How did it get to the point where we could believe that people stood by and watched people—and they knew about it—be put into the wholesale-factory-like incineration, destruction, starvation, belittlement and everything that went through the Holocaust? I'm not Jewish, but I certainly did take—from stories that were conveyed to me by my father about my grandfather and the way they held the people who did that in absolute and utter contempt—that there was just this absolute, unbelievable disdain. Why would you do this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about Australia and, might I say, New Zealand is that we have an incredible egalitarian ethos that you don't understand until you go somewhere else. All the time in Australia, if you're too much on the edge, people tell you to tone it down. 'Take it down a cog. Take a pill.' We don't like extremism. Inherently in us, we see the evil that perpetrates that—the evil seed that grows in that garden that lives on the extreme of the Left and the Right. It's not just that we see it in antisemitism; that is the most profound thing, and I'll go to that, because that's what we're seeing now. But you saw it in Pol Pot and in the extreme of the Left. You could see it in Mao's China. It was wholesale destruction of people through the Cultural Revolution—just starving them to death. I did have family members on a side of the family who were Chinese that certainly did live that. Why? It was because they'd been to university. Apparently that was evil, so they were sent out to the countryside to die. The trees died because they ate the bark off them. That's what happens when you let this evil animal—this evil snake—have its head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our philosophical premise in being Australian and our duty is that, when we see this start to rise up, we don't wait until it comes to its horrific time on the throne. You deal with it immediately. That's what has gone wrong here. This thing has started. It's like a fire. When a fire gets out the tip of the filth and into the grass, you don't wait until it's halfway up the hill before you try to put it out. You put it out immediately. We haven't put this out. It has grown and followed exactly the same malaise as the absolute evil of Germany in the period of 1933 through to 1945. It starts innocuously. 'Oh, they're just a bunch of radicals. Don't worry about them. They're just in the corner. They'll never go anywhere.' No-one takes them seriously. Well, they didn't take them seriously in Germany, either, until they started mustering up people from the whole of Europe and murdering them. Even then, once they got to that point, let's be honest—most people just stood by and watched.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The premise of this is that we have a duty to jump on this, not just from the conservative side or the Labor side but from both sides. People of moderation are duty bound to deal with this and deal with it immediately. If we have respect for those who have fought for our nations, we will remember that tens of thousands of Australians died against the extreme regimes of the filth of fascism—that's what I call it—and its like-minded person in imperial Japan. It's the same thing. They were just wholesale murdering people. They didn't care. What happens if you let this get away is that a certain group of people determine that another group of people are merely animals, and they act like animals in how they deal with people. This is why it is not incumbent just on this parliament to deal with this issue but on all Australians. That ethos of egalitarianism and moderation says that, when you hear someone like what the member for Riverina was talking about, you're actually duty bound to go up to them and say: 'Mate, tone it down. I don't find what you've said acceptable. You are not respecting the egalitarian nature of Australia. We know what you're doing; you're inciting hate. You're inciting a movement. You're basically working on the back of that.' I would say that they work on the back of issues pertinent to the Middle East, which we're seeing in Israel and Gaza. It's not for the betterment of the people of Gaza. They're not turning up there to say, 'We're going to build hospitals,' or to try to deal with the issues there. 'We're going to join a United Nations peacekeeping force!' They're using it in Australia for the incitement of a movement of the extreme. In the incitement of the movement of the extreme, once more in our nation—and I've never seen it, but for the first time, out of the tip of filth, the fire is in the grass. Now we've all got a job to put this fire out, and this bill is a part of that. It's a part of what we've done here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know how much is gained or added to by going through the history of the process, but it is a fact that on 7 October Israel was invaded. It's as simple as that. If Australia were invaded in the same way that Israel was invaded, you would expect a response from this parliament and our defence force that was absolutely profound and that dealt with it in such a form as to remove the threat. That would be the expectation if, let's pretend, some island we've never heard of manifested itself overnight and decided to attack Australia and do what happened on October 7 in Israel. The response of the Australian Army—led by Labor, Liberal, National, whatever you like—would be that they must deal with that immediately and in the most profound way. But we all want peace there. There is no solace or solution in the loss of life for innocent people. Actually, that's the problem; some people do believe that's okay. In fascism, they did believe it was a-okay to murder innocent people. Under Pol Pot, they did believe it. In Stalinist Russia, they did believe it. In Mao's China they did believe it. The Hutus in Rwanda believed it. They did believe it was right to murder innocent people, throw them down toilets, or fill up football stadiums with them and just murder them outright. They did believe that—no doubt, it's happening right now. But, when it comes to Australia, and when we see people pop up and start espousing their views on racial grounds, on religious grounds or on ethical grounds, it's always the same. They believe they are 100 per cent right and everybody else is 100 per cent wrong. On that premise, they believe they have the right to create harm, and it doesn't stop there; they ultimately believe they have the right to kill other humans because they believe the other humans are not human. They are less than human; they are subhuman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back, in my family, we were not allowed to even draw a swastika, a symbol of hate. It was not allowed. If you draw a war plane, do not put a swastika on it. My father was from the right, he was a conservative, but he had a pathological dislike of fascism. It was a subject, an issue, that would be held in absolute disdain. There was nothing to be mentioned but that it was evil. There was nothing to be mentioned but any semblance of it, any sense of it, any sight of it was to be crushed. When my father's friends came round—ex-serviceman who served in New Guinea, in the Middle East, all round—they were from every side. They joked about my dad because he actually started in the left—he was a boilermaker, fitter and turner, and he actually met Chifley—but he was on the right when he finished. One of his mates who fought in Papua New Guinea, Jim Flower, was a pacifist. He demanded never to wear a firearm, but he was one of the bravest people there. He would go out in the scrub, find people screaming and get them back to the hospital. He did that, and when he was around his unit he was seen as one of the bravest men who had ever lived. He was from the left. He was definitely on the left. He drove my mother crazy, because she was on the right. But all these people had one thing in common: moderation. You have a beer together, you don't get too worked up about politics, you don't bang on too much about your religion—that's your business. Keep your business to yourself because this is how we get along in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These symbols of hate say that that ethos of Australia, that egalitarian ethos, is to be put aside for an alternative view. Now, it shouldn't be part of any part of the world, but most definitely it should never be part of Australia. It is just not who we are. Like the filth that comes out of the tip and the fire that comes out of the tip and lands on the grass—what we immediately have to do on the Labor side, the Liberal side, the Nationals side and the crossbench side is find that fire, seek out and close in on that fire and put it out. Don't let them divide us up. Say, 'You've got no friends on the Labor side, you've got no friends on the crossbench side, you've got no friends anywhere.' This filth is going out. This filth is going back into the tip. We're going to find a backhoe and cover you up, and you can basically just lay dormant like a dinosaur.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I rise today to speak on this bill with deep sadness and deep concern about the state of our nation and with a deep sense of purpose. Our country is at a decisive point, and it's the role of this parliament to ensure that we set this nation on the right course and that we send a strong message and call out appalling behaviour and actions for what they are—criminal acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 aims to strengthen Australia's criminal laws to provide better protection against hate crimes. It does so in three main ways. Firstly, the bill strengthens existing offences for urging the use of force or violence. It does so by widening their application so that they apply when someone urges force or violence against members of a group distinguished by sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status and disability. The offence currently protects groups distinguished by race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin or political opinion. The bill also strengthens the offence for urging the use of force or violence by removing the defence of good faith and changing the fault element that the prosecution must prove from intent to recklessness. These changes will make it easier to successfully prosecute this offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill creates a new criminal offence for threatening force or violence against targeted groups and members of targeted groups I listed earlier. This will help fill a gap in the current laws to address conduct which involves a direct threat from one person to another rather than to a group or a member of a group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill strengthens the 'public display of prohibited hate symbols' offences—laws that were passed by this place last year. The bill does this by expanding the list of groups which these offences protect to include groups distinguished by sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We debate this bill at a time of grave risk and vulnerability for Australia's Jewish community. The level of antisemitism we have experienced in this country over recent months is unlike anything I've witnessed in my lifetime. I can't imagine the fear Jewish Australians are living with. Just last week we marked the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and we know antisemitism is one of the oldest forms of hatred. It is a fear and a wound that is generations deep. In Australia we are free to practice our faith but it's clear there are people out there who seek to intimidate, to terrorise and to hate, and to do this to people because of their Jewish faith, with graffiti on cars, homes, schools, childcare centres, workplaces and places of worship. The arson attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue of Melbourne, and the discovery in Sydney of a caravan packed with explosives and with the address of a Sydney synagogue on a piece of paper inside—these incidents are truly terrifying. Of course, that is their purpose—to incite terror, hatred and fear. We cannot allow these incidents to go by unremarked and unchecked. These incidents must not be normalised. They must never be excused. The perpetrators of these attacks must be held to the full force of the law. There must be consequences for these vile actions, which have no place in our society. They have no place in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just part of the ways in which government can and should respond to the hateful acts of violence and threats against the Australian Jewish community. More must be done as well. It's important to note that this bill is not exclusively about antisemitism; it covers hate crimes against members of the community with protected attributes including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status and disability. This is vital because there are many marginalised groups in our community who are also feeling vulnerable. There are people out there who wish them ill, who wish to do them harm because of their faith, their sexuality, their gender, their identity or their disability. These fears are not unfounded, as anti-Muslim graffiti and incidents are also increasing in our community. These incidents must be acknowledged, they must be counted and they must be stamped out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the fear and unease in the LGBTIQ community, and we must be constantly alive to the discrimination and hatred members of this community experience as well. Acknowledging the hatred and the intimidation experienced by other members of the community does not seek to minimise the impact of the escalation in antisemitism on the Jewish community in Australia. We must call out all types of hatred and all efforts to threaten and intimidate people based on their faith, their sexuality, their gender or their disability, because this is how we become a truly cohesive society. And I agree with the words of the member for New England and the member for Riverina, who both said earlier that it's not just the parliament who is responsible here, as indeed we most certainly are, but every single Australian who must look into their own heart and into their own actions and never walk past or remain silent when they see this hatred in action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the amendments put forward in good faith to this bill. The member for Wentworth has worked closely with Jewish leaders and equality advocates to draft amendments that expand the bill to cover serious vilification offences. The member for Wentworth's electorate has experienced horrific attacks over the last few months in particular, and we must listen to them to find the solution. The member for Wentworth's amendments to the bill would address gaps in legislation where the promotion of violence and hatred is not considered a crime because it does not meet the requirements of explicitly urging or threatening violence. The offence will focus on promotion of hatred and violence and draws upon existing laws in Western Australia that have been tested in the courts to ensure they achieve the right balance with free speech principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support these amendments, and I urge the whole parliament to also support them. This is not about restricting freedom of speech; it's about proper consequences for threats and promoting violence against specific groups. And I also note the coalition's amendments to explicitly outlaw threats and attacks against places of worship. Again, I condemn the abhorrent attacks and threats against synagogues that have recently occurred. It's for this reason I support the coalition's amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a crucial element of our nation's response to the rising antisemitism the Jewish community faces. It's an addition to our Criminal Code that, frankly, is overdue. But it's not the start and end of how we as a parliament, as legislators from across the political spectrum, should respond to the problems that we face. In their submission, the Law Council of Australia warned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there are significant limitations on the role of criminal law an instrument of social policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should dwell on this point. How will the government, the parliament and we as legislators and leaders of this country influence our social fabric, our social cohesion? We must continue to act to combat hate and to build trust and safety and bonds across all the different communities that make up our great country of Australia because we will not prosecute our way to social cohesion. We won't. Social cohesion is something that is created, something that is tended and something that is protected. Tim Costello recently wrote for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Social cohesion is both a gift and a challenge. Building it requires risk, and maintaining it requires crossing lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He called out 'conflict entrepreneurs' who have politicised the conflict in Gaza and then decried the breakdown in social cohesion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The terror attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 was abhorrent. The destruction and loss of life in Gaza in the time since then has been devastating. The current ceasefire is fragile. There are those in Australia who have sought to capitalise on these events to drive division, to widen the cracks into a fissure that cannot be crossed. And they have done so through threats, through violence and through intimidation. We must not stand for it. We must stand for peace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. This is an issue—the challenge of antisemitism and how we respond to it as a nation—which is of great concern to many, many Australians. It is certainly an issue of very considerable concern in the electorate of Bradfield, which has the second-largest Jewish community of any federal electorate in New South Wales. It has four synagogues and a Jewish school, Masada College. Just last Friday, I was at a service at one of those four synagogues, North Shore Synagogue in Lindfield, at the invitation of Rabbi Lewin. I was joined by the mayor of Ku-ring-gai, Christine Kay; the state member for Davidson, Matt Cross; and the Liberal candidate for Bradfield, Gisele Kapterian. We were there along with other local dignitaries and leaders to express our concern for our local Jewish community and for the Jewish community of Australia. I know our local Jewish community, along with the Jewish community all across Australia, is rightly enormously concerned about the shocking upsurge in antisemitism that we have seen throughout Australia since the 7 October 2023 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed I've attended numerous events in my electorate over the last year and a half in response to the enormous and entirely justifiable and understandable concerns of my Jewish constituents and, I might say, of the broader body of my constituents in Bradfield. In Bradfield, as around Australia, alarm and concern about the outbreak of antisemitism in Australia is certainly felt by Jewish Australians, but it is also felt by Australians of goodwill of all faiths and none, because it is a threat to social cohesion, it is a threat to social order and it is a threat to civilisation and to the values which underpin our modern Australian nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2023, shortly after the appalling 7 October terrorist attack, I attended a moving service at Kehillat Masada synagogue in St Ives. Several North Shore synagogues came together at that service; it was physically held at Masada, as I mentioned. A significant number of dignitaries and leaders joined that event. It was an opportunity for the Bradfield Jewish community and the North Shore Jewish community to come together in mutual support and to express their support for the victims of the appalling terrorist attack, their loved ones, their families and indeed all who were rightly concerned about that appalling event. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June last year, I spoke about antisemitism at a community forum at North Shore Synagogue. In August 2024, there was another event at the North Shore Synagogue with a focus on Jewish teenagers and young people. In November 2024, I spoke about antisemitism at Chabad North Shore, one of our other synagogues in St Ives. I spoke to a group of about 120 people and answered questions for quite a considerable period of time, which is evidence of the enormous degree of concern amongst our Jewish community in Bradfield, as there is enormous concern amongst Jews, their friends and supporters all across Australia. I visited the homes of Jewish constituents in St Ives, where I heard from several families—parents, teenagers and young adult children—about the antisemitism and bullying that those Jewish young people had been experiencing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise, therefore, to speak on this bill with a very considerable interest in the issues it seeks to address and a clear recognition of its importance to social cohesion in our nation but also of its particular importance to the community that I represent in Bradfield. Sadly, we have seen from the present government a lamentable failure to engage in a determined and effective way with the rise of antisemitism. The fact is that Australia is one of the world's great multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multireligious nations. That is something in which we should all take enormous pride. Our success in this regard is built on core Australian values of mutual tolerance, respect and understanding. The shocking incidents of antisemitism that we have seen across Australia, and their violent manifestations, are entirely at odds with the values of mutual tolerance, respect and understanding which underpin Australia's success as a multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural and multireligious nation. These outbreaks of antisemitism are to be condemned for a whole host of reasons. One of the reasons they are to be condemned is because they are wholly at odds with the values which underpin our modern Australian nation. The sad fact is that the appalling terrorist attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 has energised and unleashed Hamas sympathisers in Australia. That is something to be absolutely regretted, condemned, and accurately recognised and described as entirely at odds with Australian values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that we have not seen a stronger, clearer, more courageous response from the Prime Minister and from the Albanese Labor government. It is mystifying that the Prime Minister and other senior Labor figures find it impossible, evidently, to speak about antisemitism without, in the very same sentence, using the word 'Islamophobia'. Let's be clear: hatred directed at Jews must be condemned. Hatred directed at Muslims must be condemned. But they do not need to be endlessly linked in a rhetorical formula used by self-declared 'progressives' as some kind of designated form of moral equivalence. We need to recognise that there is a particular and serious problem with antisemitism, and we need to have a clear and strong policy response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, the changes made by the laws that are proposed before the House today are changes that the coalition welcomes and supports. We regret that it has taken so long to get to this point, given that the bill was introduced in the last sitting week in September 2024. We've made efforts to encourage the government to speed it up. It's good that we have this bill before us. There should be no doubt in the minds of anybody engaging in the kind of violent antisemitic conduct that we have seen, sadly, over the last year and a half, that they face serious jail time. The measures in this bill are strong but they are necessary. The scourge of antisemitism is something that we must be resolute in opposing. It is fundamentally at odds with the values which underpin the modern Australian nation, one of the world's great multiracial, multi-ethnic, multicultural and multireligious nations, and that is why strong action is necessary.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I'm saddened to rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. I never thought I would come to this place and talk about antisemitism and the rise that we've seen over the past 18 months.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1947 a ship loaded with Hungarian migrants came to Australia. Most of them, but not all of them, were Jews, but they were all fleeing the persecution they'd seen during the Second World War from the fascist regime of the Nazis. Two of those on board were Joszef Kovach and Stephan Katerinka. They'd never met each other. Joszef Kovach was lucky; his parents were educated—they were teachers—and he was educated, and he'd learned to speak English at a young age. His whole family was wiped out by the Nazis. Similarly, Stephan Katerinka was from a poor family. His whole family was wiped out by the Nazis. That would have been the same story for most of those people on that boat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They came to Australia and went to the migrant camp in Cowra, and then, when they were able to, they moved to Sydney, and they stayed friends. They set up a tea house in Paddington, and anybody who knows Paddington knows it is right in the centre of an area which has a large Jewish settlement today. They then went on to open a smallgoods shop, and they both prospered in Australia. Joe went on to work 30-odd years with Qantas, and Stephan had a very large chicken supply business down on the South Coast. One thing they had in common, apart from the persecution and the loss of their families, was a love of Australia. They loved the freedom in Australia and the democracy they had in Australia, and the fact that they could walk through the streets of Paddington without being persecuted for being a minority group. With what we have seen over the past 12 months, both Joe and Steve would be rolling in their graves.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear that this bill is too little, too late. The cynic in me says it's come about because we have an election coming up; I hope to God that is not true. What we've seen over the past 12 months is disgusting. It is disgusting to see in Australia. After the October 7 attacks, which can only be described as pure evil, we saw people standing on a world-renowned monument, the Opera House, chanting antisemitic slogans. That should have been stopped there and then. But the response from this government has been equivocal. Despite, time and time again, Peter Dutton, David Littleproud and the coalition putting forward motions to suspend standing orders to talk about this, to do something about this, they have been knocked down and silenced by Labor, or Labor has been equivocal. Worse still, some of the Independents and the Greens have been pouring fuel on the fire. That is making things even worse. Things have escalated from the Opera House to graffiti, firebombings and a, thankfully, thwarted terrorist attack with a caravan full of explosives. This evil has been propagated by the fact that the Prime Minister of this country has been equivocal, that we haven't stood up and said, 'We will not put up with this.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently in my electorate, on 1 June, I got a phone call to say that my office had been graffitied with 'eye on Rafah'. There was big red paint splashed everywhere in Coffs Harbour. It was the same red paint that had been used on my office only the year before saying 'koala killer'. These ideologues wouldn't know which river to which sea. It's just something shiny and new for them to get on. They're the same extremists who used to abuse me about the climate, which apparently was all fixed when Labor got in. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dave Sharma came up to my electorate to speak to some of the Liberal Party members who are up in my electorate, and one of them asked a question about the antisemitic behaviour that had been occurring in Coffs Harbour. You don't have to go to Melbourne or Sydney for it to happen. Jewish members of my community are being abused. Jewish members of my community are having their businesses boycotted. One of them asked me, 'What can we do?' My response was, 'Why should you be doing anything when our leaders aren't?' The standard you walk past is the standard that you accept. Our leaders—the police commissioner in New South Wales, the Prime Minister, the commissioners in every state and territory—should be getting their troops together and saying, 'If you see this, if you hear antisemitic slogans, if you see people carrying flags from terrorist organisations, then you lock them up.' Have we seen that? How can we expect our community to stand up against these lunatics? That's what they are: lunatics with evil intentions. How can we ask our people, whether they're in the city or they're in the regions, to stand up against these evil actors, as they're called, when our leaders won't?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last week, I was waiting to do an interview on 2GB with Mark Levy about the crime that's happening in regional and rural Australia. The police commissioner, Karen Webb, was being interviewed by Mark Levy, who's doing his best to call out this antisemitic behaviour across the country. He asked why these people weren't being locked up for chanting 'from the river to the sea'. That chant is part of Hamas's charter from 2017—from the river to the sea—and it talks about the ethnic cleansing of Jews and getting rid of Jews. That's from their charter; that's not me saying that. This is a listed terrorist organisation. Mark Levy said to the commissioner, 'Why can't you lock them up for saying this?' Her response was, 'In my view, it doesn't amount to breaching section 93Z of the Crimes Act in New South Wales. Section 93Z says:</span>

The commissioner's response was: 'In my view, I don't see it as a breach.' Well, Commissioner, where is your advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions? You're not the judge, jury and executioner; you are the police commissioner. Go and get advice from the DPP. Or have you asked the court for a guideline judgment? They do it all the time. They make guideline judgments about drink driving; they make guideline judgments about all areas of law. It is not your call to say, 'I don't think it amounts to a breach.' It is up to the judiciary.</span>

Go and lock the offender up. Be brave. Have the courage of your convictions. Have the courage to be an Australian and act for all Australians. Take it to court. Make it a test case. Go to the High Court. Be a hero. Be a hero for the Australian people. Be a hero for the Jewish community because, if you don't, we know the commissioner won't. The commissioner won't stand up and enforce these laws. I've spoken to magistrates. I've spoken to judges and I've spoken to police.

They are Australians, and anyone who propagates this evil violence or these evil words needs to be locked up for a very long time. If you're not a citizen, away you go. See you later. You're gone.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  The Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to strengthen existing offences for urging force or violence and the display of hate symbols and to introduce new offences for threatening force or violence against targeted groups and their members. The fault aspect for the existing offences of urging force or violence is also to be reduced from 'intent' to 'recklessness'. The bill also proposes to remove an existing good faith defence for offences of urging force or violence and for the proposed offences of threatening force or violence. The groups against whom it would be an offence to threaten force or violence would be distinguished by race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, disability, nationality, national or ethnic origin, or political opinion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill was introduced in September last year, the coalition offered to pass the bill with haste, but the government refused. Perhaps if it hadn't we would not have seen the horror we have seen over summer. I am nevertheless relieved it is happening in this sitting fortnight, which is most likely the last sitting fortnight of the 47th Parliament. This is a serious piece of legislation which responds to abhorrent behaviours by evil actors—behaviours which we have seen growing in incidents in Australia since the atrocities of October 7. On that October 7, Hamas, a recognised terrorist organisation, attacked Israel. Two days later we saw the first instance of what, at least to me, seemed to be a fundamental breach of the Australian ethos of equality, acceptance and tolerance; our celebration of our diversity and our heritage; and our proud boast of being one of the best multicultural countries in the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sydney Opera House sails were lit up with blue and white in recognition of the atrocities Israel had just suffered. Yet there was a protest beneath those sails, and antisemitic chants were heard. There is debate about what occurred that night, but the images speak for themselves. Watching them, you see an anti-Israel mob setting off flares and chanting death wishes to Jewish Australians. That protest was advertised by the Palestine Action Group on that day, while the murder of Jewish people along the Gaza Strip was still ongoing and as the 251 hostages of Hamas began what has become for so many more than a year in captivity. A day later, Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud addressed a large protest in Lakemba in Western Sydney, and he cried to the crowd:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm elated. It's a day of courage, it's a day of resistance, it's a day of pride, it's a day of victory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the beginning. Since then there has been a more than 700 per cent increase in antisemitic attacks and antisemitic behaviour in this country. As we in the coalition have raised elsewhere, time and time again, the Prime Minister stands condemned for failing to address these matters as and when they occur. He has been vastly outshone by the New South Wales Premier, whose forcefulness of word and belief demonstrates what could and should be done with a moral compass. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after the October 7 attacks, I travelled to Israel on what I think remains the only bipartisan trip to Israel since the atrocities of that day. The members for Macnamara and Higgins attended, along with the member for Fisher and Senators Birmingham and Fawcett. We went to Tel Aviv in Jerusalem as well as Sderot on the Gaza border, a town that, at the time, had a population of 3,000 down from 37,000 before the attacks. We visited the kibbutz Kfar Aza to see where the terror of October 7 and the days that followed had begun. We listened to soldiers, parliamentarians, local MPs, people who run civil services for residents, families of hostages and locals grieving their lost ones. We also met with the Palestinian Authority. I have never encountered so many shades of grief as I saw in that week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an overarching desire for peace on all sides but a recognition that that cannot happen without the disablement of Hamas, a terrorist organisation that is roughly 70 kilometres from the towns of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. It's extremely close; you can get there in less than a couple of hours. It's extremely present. It's a terrorist organisation, which, short and simple, will accept nothing less than the eradication of Israel and her people. It was that week while I was in Israel that we saw the Albanese government sending horrendous mixed messages regarding Israel's right to defend herself. While we were there, the Albanese government joined others at the UN General Assembly calling for a ceasefire, along with—almost as an afterthought—the immediate release of hostages. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was with the member for Macnamara on the bus late at night, travelling from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, I think. We had just missed rocket alerts and shelter commands in Jerusalem. Josh was on the bus; he took a call, and his face went grey. May I say it takes a lot to turn the member for Macnamara's face grey; he is one of the most jovial and optimistic blokes in this place—full of grace and often full of giggle. He doesn't do grey well. 'Are you okay, buddy?' I asked him. 'Hmm,' came the stony response. He put up a good front the next day. He did a fair swathe of media, and he was clear and compelling in his description of what we were seeing in Israel: 200,000 people displaced from their homes and the stories of 1,200 people slaughtered over that weekend of 7 and 8 October.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said elsewhere, I commend the member for Macnamara's moral clarity and his constant voice for Jewish Australians. Together with the efforts of the member for Berowra, they have made this place and this country a better place, reminding us of our better selves, living in not just a tolerant but a safe and welcoming country for people of all faiths and backgrounds. But their grace has failed to stem the tide of antisemitic acts which have blighted our beautiful country over the last 15 months: the member for Macnamara's office was graffitied and burned in June 2024, putting at risk the lives and wellbeing of his staff and other residents of that building; the Adass Israel Synagogue was burned to the ground in December 2024; a car in Woollahra was set alight and anti-Israel graffiti littered the suburb in November 2024; the same again happened in Woollahra a month later; in January of this year, two more synagogues were vandalised with swastikas; a childcare centre was set alight, topped off with more graffiti; the former home of the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry was vandalised with red paint; more cars and more graffiti; a school was vandalised with antisemitic graffiti; a caravan with explosives was discovered alongside an antisemitic note; earlier this week, eggs were thrown at women in Bondi in Sydney, with the Strike Force Pearl's commander treating the matter as an antisemitic attack owing to the women's clothes potentially identifying them as targets of that nature; and, in recent nights, a home in Middle Park in Melbourne has been defaced with antisemitic graffiti.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Executive Council for Australian Jewry for their work tracking and reporting anti-Jewish incidents in Australia in 2024. Their report—the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>ECAJ Report on Anti-Jewish Incidents in Australia 2024—makes for harrowing reading. Reading it, you will see the incidents I listed above; they don't even scratch the surface of what has been happening in our country. The language used in some of the other incidents described in this report is deeply distressing, like a graffito of supposed 'Zionists': a caricature of a man with big ears, a big nose, horns and long, witch-like fingers. There have been physical assaults on Jewish Australians walking in a public park and going to a 7-Eleven, and there have been rocks thrown, spitting and Red Bull cans thrown out of cars at gatherers around a synagogue. It's endless, harrowing and compulsory reading. And while I'm grateful for organisations like the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, who have worked for decades to build awareness of Israel in this place and on collaboration and affection between our two countries, I do not necessarily need these reports to know something terrible is happening in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Flinders on 12 November 2023—the day after Remembrance Day—a statue of a World War I soldier which had been carved into a tree stump was vandalised with a swastika. The RSL cleaned it up, cut it down and put the statue behind the walls of the RSL garden where it would be safe. In November 2024 swastikas were spray-painted across the main road of the Flinders township and upon the <span style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span> sculpture which sits beautifully in the centre of town. At various points, swastikas have been painted on the roads or on our 'welcome to township' signs. I was even told recently on a visit to the Rosebud Country Club that someone had carved swastikas into the sand bunkers. It's bizarre and it's sick.</span>

                    </a>  Beyond the evidence of antisemitism in my electorate is the evidence of my friends. One of my dearest friends lives in Dover Heights, down the road from the attack on the former home of Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin. If you need reminding, on 17 January emergency services were called to Dover Heights when four cars were damaged and one was graffitied with the words 'F Israel', and another vehicle with 'F Jews', which was also set alight. At the time, out of concern for my friend, I suggested she come and stay with me for a few days, maybe with some sun on the Mornington Peninsula, to get away from it all. Her response was ferocious:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thanks Z. But what I really need is some law enforcement to create a deterrent. The fact that this happened the day after a ceasefire agreement was announced shows this has little to do with the Middle East and is anti-semitism pure and simple. I am not hiding. I am angry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the attacks in Kingsford last weekend I checked in with her again, and she replied:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My family member goes to school there and is already terrified. Last night another family member called in a panic to check we were ok, as she saw a whole lot of police and ambulances heading in the direction of Dover Heights.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has chopped and changed his language about the stark antisemitism we have been seeing over the last 15 months, and last week we had an astonishing statement by the Treasurer in response to the discovery of a caravan laden with explosives alongside a list of addresses of Jewish organisations, businesses and homes. On the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show last week the Treasurer said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What it shows is that the fears that a lot of Australians in the Jewish community have are not always unfounded.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not always unfounded! I know he apologised afterwards—and what a relief that he did—but it hints to you the mistrust this government has towards Australia's Jewish community and the belittling of its well-founded fear of violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is unfortunately necessary because of the mixed messages from this government, which has allowed hate free rein. But it's not just the provisions of the bill which matter; it's the use of them, as my friend so rightly pointed out. Antisemitic displays must be prosecuted and antisemitic protests must be stopped. Existing laws have not been used. Protests in our street in which antisemitic displays have been paraded have dragged on for months. Universities have set up antisemitic camps. While this bill will mitigate some of the government's failures, we can only hope the provisions will be used. Existing provisions of the Criminal Code have not been used—like division 80, which makes it an offence to urge violence against individuals or groups on the basis of race, religion and the like.</span>

Jewish places of worship and scholarship, Jewish businesses and Jewish schools have been calling for action for months. Jewish families, their friends and my friend have been calling for action for months. This week we have spent some time in contemplation of the antisemitic blight brought upon this beautiful country. Maybe now action will follow.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  It's a sad day when we have a bill such as the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 being debated in the parliament. I will start off with a comment that speaks to this bill. It's about the hate crimes and antisemitic behaviour we're seeing in Australia at the moment, and, predominantly, our lack of leadership in addressing these hate crimes. This has been going on for years, as Martin Niemoller first penned when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those were controversial comments at the time. That quotation expresses Niemoller's belief that Germans had been complicit, through their silence, in the Nazi imprisonment, prosecution and murder of millions of people, including Jews. We need to change the behaviour which is sneaking into the Australian psyche and landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been the beneficiary of a bipartisan visit to Israel and Palestine to see things firsthand, and what I witnessed was quite extraordinary—the vehement hatred that exists from one culture to the next, the generational bile that exists. It's indoctrinated into children. When in Palestine, I saw memorials similar to our Anzac memorials, where we honour and remember those fallen servicemen and women, in pretty much every regional town in Australia. They have similar memorials, but the names that are remembered are of children or people who have strapped on a suicide vest with the sole intent of killing as many Jews as possible. It's called 'pay for slay'—the more people you kill, the greater the stipend your family is given. Those funds are generated through the United Nations. The storybooks in the schools in some of the Palestinian communities depict Walt Disney characters like Mickey Mouse with suicide vests on, as though this is the pathway for these children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the places we visited in Palestine seemed to be more welfare reliant—more reliant on handouts. The best-paying jobs were those in the construction sector beyond the wall, in Israel in the building sector. Those who did work were paid well; it was unskilled labour but they were paid well, I'm led to believe, and the jobs were well sought after. I had the opportunity to catch up with the Palestinian Prime Minister. I said, 'I don't know why, and I don't pretend to know why, the hate exists and the many years that it's existed for, and I don't pretend to have an answer for you. We're only a small country in Australia, and it'd just be really handy for us if you guys stopped bombing each other for about six months because we're trying to help another country who's in a spot of bother'—and that was Ukraine. He put his hand on my hand and said, 'You speak the truth.' It was a confronting visit and it was one that allows me to make a contribution today because, once you see the impacts and once you live for a number of weeks with the Israeli community who go to sleep every night under a dome to counter the regular bomb attacks—when they go to sleep each night knowing that 32 per cent of Israel's GDP is going to that offence budget—you see that it's another world that we take for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you see the antisemitic attacks that we're seeing now across the country that came with the October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas, I think there can be no equivocation or denial that the October 7 attacks were the single greatest loss of Jewish lives on any day since the Holocaust. October 7 was a day of brutal murder, torture, kidnapping and sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas against Jews in Israel. The attacks were deliberate, cruel and barbaric. We don't need to repeat the heinous acts in this chamber, but there's no doubt that they were designed with the purpose of maximising pain and sorrow amongst the Jewish community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would've thought that the Jewish community had probably suffered enough. Last year, I was in France when the Rugby World Cup was on and I took the opportunity with my wife to swing past Germany. We went to Dachau, one of the detention camps, and it gets real as soon as you walk into those buildings and you see the furnaces, the conditions and the museum. You see the way that humans treated other humans and you feel physically ill. As legislators, we should be doing everything in our power to make sure those same mistakes are never repeated and that we stop them when we see them in our universities and in our streets. Hopefully, this bill goes some way to stopping them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our speaking points talk about the role of our prime minister, and Australians looked to the Prime Minister to set the tone for the national response to that crisis. He could've made it clear through his actions from the very beginning that those who sought to spread antisemitic attacks would feel the full force of the law, but it wasn't the case. He should've been clear from the very beginning about the scale of the horror inflicted by Hamas and that Australia stands with its long-term friend and ally Israel, a democratically elected government in the Middle East. He should've used our laws and the police forces to clamp down on those who sought to weaponise the Hamas attacks for their own hateful purposes here at home. The Prime Minister failed the test of leadership, and he has failed the Jewish community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know which emotion I felt when I saw the protests at the universities and on campuses around Australia. There was the presumption that these students, who had the right to protest, had some academic context or some knowledge and historical context because they were on university campuses. But the emotion that I was left with was that, when they were asked by journalists while they were chanting the Hamas-indoctrinated 'river to the sea' chant, the bulk of them could not tell the journalists which river or which sea and had no depth or sense of the cruelty and the absolute annihilation that that chant speaks to. Then they gave megaphones to Australian children with no concept or sense of the impact that it would have across the country. And then, as if that wasn't enough, these people who protested came after our veterans in the way that they vandalised war memorials across the country, particularly here. There was one in Canberra where they splashed paint all over it. That's an absolutely appalling, abhorrent reflection on the honourable servicemen and women who left their families, went overseas and put their lives on the line. Some never returned, and you've got a group of people here in Australia, that live under the freedom that those very men and women provided them, denigrating their contributions to this country by vandalising memorials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear what this country's future is with a lack of leadership. There have been consequences for the inaction under the PM's watch. The consequences of this government's indifference to domestic antisemitism has been stark. There have been months of protests in our capital cities and the occupations of our universities. We've seen doxxing of Jewish businesses and the harassment of Jewish students and academics. Buildings have been vandalised, homes defaced and cars torched. We saw the attempted arsons of synagogues in Sydney and the burning of a daycare centre in Maroubra. We saw the terrorist firebombing of the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. We have seen now, extraordinarily, a caravan packed with explosives apparently targeting Jewish addresses, and have a Prime Minister who, as a result of question time today, was in the dark that any of this was happening—completely oblivious. It was an extraordinary failure by a weak Prime Minister as he stood by and allowed the strain of antisemitism to spread. It's making our nation's character poorer. It's an indictment on the leadership. I'm sorry that this bill is before the House, and I'm sorry that we're not joined in condemning this behaviour by those who sit on the other side of the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. It is beyond disappointing that the rise of antisemitism in this country has gotten to a point where we have to introduce legislation to counter it. This is a bill that is, sadly, necessary because of the repeated failures of the Albanese Labor government to prevent this sadly predictable spread of antisemitism. This all stems from weak leadership from the Prime Minister and by the Labor government in general. Attacks on Jewish Australians are attacks on every Australian. Today, it's the Jews, but who's next? Will it be the Hindus, or the Christians, or the Muslims, or the atheists? Attacking people because of their Jewish faith and ancestry is un-Australian. We are a country that prides itself on treating people equally, whatever their faith or their background is. It is a core national value, and antisemitism is a direct rejection of that value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jewish businesses, homes, cars and synagogues have all been targeted in attempts to spread antisemitism in Australia since the 7 October attacks in Israel. These are not the only places that have been targeted. Pro-Palestinian slogans and vandalism have covered war memorials all over the country, including those on Anzac Parade, just down the road from Parliament House here in Canberra. The Australian National Korean War Memorial, the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial and the Australian Army National Memorial were graffitied with pro-Palestine messages in June last year. One message of vandalism said: 'Blood on your hands, Anthony, Peter, Penny.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Returned Services League of Australia, the RSL, condemned the vandalism, with national president Greg Melick describing the damage as 'deplorable'. Those war memorials honour those who have sacrificed to protect and preserve all the freedoms that all Australians enjoy. He said the dabbing of protest slogans is 'nothing short of despicable'. It is dishonourable in the extreme to use war memorials as a platform for a protest. I completely agree with Greg, and I believe that hate speech laws should include the vandalism of war memorials. I believe that, for men and women who have sacrificed their lives in the defence of freedom for this nation, the least we can do is honour their legacy and the contribution to this nation they all made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many would be aware, the initial spark of the antisemitic attacks we are now seeing across the country came with the 7 October terrorist attacks on Israel by the terrorist group Hamas. There can be no equivocation or denial of this. The 7 October attacks saw the single greatest loss of Jewish lives on any day since the Holocaust in the Second World War; 7 October was a day of murder, torture, kidnapping and brutal sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas against Jews in Israel. The attack was deliberately cruel and barbaric. We don't need to repeat these heinous acts in this chamber, but there is no doubt they were designed for the purpose of maximising pain and sorrow amongst Jewish people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is both desperately sad and utterly predictable that, on learning of these horrific attacks on Jewish people in their own homeland, malicious actors here in Australia would draw inspiration from them. These bad actors here in Australia rejoiced in a day that was marked by the murder, torture, sexual assault and kidnapping of innocent people in Israel. And this is not exaggerated. In the words of one hate preacher, 7 October was 'a day of courage, a day of pride' and 'a day of victory'. And this is shameful. It was obvious that they would see those attacks as giving licence to spread the same vile antisemitic hate here, targeting Jewish Australians and seeking to spread fear. They have used our streets and our university campuses to call for the destruction of the Jewish state and spread old antisemitic tropes. Often they are hiding behind weak academic pretence that somehow what they were doing was anti-Israel, not antisemitic. Preventing this should have been the government's focus, and this is where they have failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at the difference in leadership between the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, and the leader of the coalition, Peter Dutton, on antisemitism and terrorism. Australians look to the Prime Minister to set the tone of national response to a crisis, and he could have, and should have, made clear through his actions from the very beginning that those who sought to spread antisemitic attacks would feel the full force of the law. He could have, and should have, been clear right from the very beginning about the scale of the horror inflicted by Hamas and that Australia stands with its long-term friend and ally, Israel. He could and should have used our laws and our police forces to clamp down on those who sought to weaponise the Hamas attacks for their own hateful purposes here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of decisive action, we saw a false equivalence from the Prime Minister and from the Australian Labor Party. For months we had Labor ministers who couldn't acknowledge domestic antisemitism without mentioning Islamophobia, as if one would offset the other. This was at a time when we had a nationally unprecedented rise in antisemitism. We had angry mobs standing outside the Opera House chanting, 'Death to the Jews.' We saw Jewish shops being vandalised, Jewish students being harassed and gangs roaming in places like Caulfield, hunting for Jews. The Prime Minister could only talk about antisemitism and Islamophobia together, almost as if acknowledging antisemitism here at home would somehow diminish the experience of Australian Muslims. Acknowledging Jewish Australians' experiences of antisemitism does not diminish the experiences of Muslims here in Australia. Neither antisemitism nor Islamophobia has a place in our country and both should be condemned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time we are responding to an unprecedented wave of antisemitism in our country. However, when we are seeing armed guards outside Jewish schools, it is appropriate to focus on antisemitism. The Prime Minister did not do that, and his failure to do so was an indication that he did not take the threat of antisemitism seriously. It was a green light for those in Australia who wanted to take things further. We also saw the rolling failure to take decisive action here at home. Antisemitic displays were not prosecuted. Antisemitic protests were not stopped and so antisemitic sentiment was allowed to fester.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are existing criminal laws, like division 80 of the Criminal Code, that are meant to deal with things like the urging of violence against groups defined by race or religion. These laws were not used. Protests in our streets in which antisemitic displays abounded were permitted to drag on for months and months. Universities were permitted to be used as encampments that served as a hot-bed for antisemitic action. Our human rights institutions were not given focus or direction, nor called to account when they abandoned the Jewish community. The Prime Minister's response was drowsy and disinterested. Through his actions he sent a very clear message that despite what he might say, there would be no real consequences for those who target and attack Jewish Australians. This was the second green light for antisemites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's now look at the leader of the coalition, Peter Dutton, and how he has made announcements to combat antisemitism. The list includes taking a national leadership role expected of the Commonwealth government, including convening a national cabinet to combat antisemitism and extremism. He will strengthen the sentencing regime for terrorism by legislating for a mandatory minimum term of six years imprisonment for all acts of terrorism under Commonwealth law. He wants to amend draft laws currently before the parliament to make it a hate crime to urge or threaten violence towards a place of worship, punishable by imprisonment for five to seven years in the case of an aggravated offence. He would introduce mandatory minimum sentences of 12 months imprisonment for the display of prohibited antisemitic terrorist organisation symbols and related behaviour in public and increase the maximum penalty to five years in prison. He'd create a new dedicated antisemitic taskforce led by the Australian Federal Police and incorporating the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analyst Centre, the Australian Border Force, and the state police. He wants to issue a new ministerial direction to the AFP to direct them to prioritise and address antisemitism, including any unsolved crimes against the Jewish community such as doxxing, public display of terrorist symbols, incitement, harassment and other offences. He would direct the antisemitism taskforce to refer any visa holders involved in acts of antisemitism for immediate cancellation and deportation. If necessary, he would amend section 501's character provisions of the Migration Act to ensure this antisemitic conduct is captured by the law and applies retrospectively for all acts of hatred towards the Jewish community since 7 October 2023 and the terrorist acts against Israel. He will also deliver $32.5 million in security funding packages requested by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry without any strings attached, including funding armed guards at schools and synagogues. Unlike the Albanese government, which has restricted funding to armed guards only, Mr Dutton would commit $8.5 million to see a centre of Jewish life and tolerance become a reality and provide $7.5 million over three years in additional funding to Crime Stoppers to enable this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what leadership looks like. Peter Dutton and the coalition are committed to stamping out antisemitism, and that's what we intend to do should we become the government at the next federal election. </span>

Who would have thought that here in post World War II Australia—where the Jews came, following the Holocaust and the extermination of six million Jews in Hitler's death camps by a well-educated and, in those days, modern Christian nation—we would now see at least the beginnings of that behaviour in Australia. Australia has provided a safe haven for 70-plus years since that time, and now those sentiments of early 1930s Germany seem to have taken root here. It is the thin veneer of civilisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect that perhaps the right history isn't being taught to our children at school. But then, when I think about it, I don't think the history of the Holocaust was taught to me at school, either. I was an avid reader as a young man—novels, whatever—and many of the novels of the time were based in the roots of World War II, so we accumulated knowledge about what those death camps were like. I think that's missing from modern culture at the moment. Perhaps this nation needs to turn itself to making sure that our young people know what occurred at that time, and why they should always be on their guard against it. I did wonder, through those years, what was so different to our civilisation compared to that of Germany's—just given a different time and a different place. Don't think for one moment that the terrible outcomes of the Holocaust started at that level. It started at a local level with people taking action against local Jews. It was on a low scale, and then it just grew and became a monster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that we have now imported the enmities from another hemisphere, but it needs to stop and it needs to stop now. Perhaps there has been an undercurrent of antisemitism in Australia for some time but, prior to 7 October 2023, it was well suppressed. Yet within two days—well before Israel had responded—we saw people demonstrating on the steps of the Opera House, some chanting 'Where are the Jews?', others chanting, 'Gas the Jews'. 'Where are the Jews?' seems like a pretty nonsensical thing to say. But for such a thing to form so quickly and be so ugly, whatever they were chanting, you can be sure it was not complimentary. It is the seed. It's more than the seed; it's the beginnings of rabid antisemitism, and it needs to be stamped out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, every week we have had demonstrations in the streets and on university campuses. Universities have been an absolute disgrace through this period, seemingly totally incapable of standing up to the hate being preached on their campuses. We've seen security at Jewish schools and members' offices being attacked. This is a democracy—that is simply not permissible. We've seen Jewish property being defaced, Jewish businesses being attacked and the firebombing of a synagogue—what could be a bigger afront to the Jewish community? Then there was the caravan packed with explosives that we still don't know enough about. It's hard not to make those links to 1930s Germany. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This should have been jumped on from week one, and my colleagues have stated the case. We should have had a far stronger reaction to this in Australia in terms of leadership. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, the legal system is taking action against those people who've been perpetrating these views, but we've seen precious little for it. Whether or not the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill is appropriate and whether or not it is the courts that are refusing to actually reach out and reach the kinds of penalties that I think the good people in the street are expecting, I'm not so sure, but that's what is behind the coalition's push to put in mandatory sentencing for acts of terrorism which are characterised under these things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, where are the consequences? Last week, I put out an e-newsletter, and one of the things I talked about in the e-newsletter was antisemitism in Australia at the moment. I had a response from woman that was very polite and to the point. She challenged my views on Palestine, and I cannot find myself talking about the subject and these new hate laws without actually making the link between antisemitism and what has been happening with those supporters of Palestine and what's been happening with the Gaza Strip. This is what I responded. I don't normally read my speeches, but I'm sure you'll forgive me for actually going through this letter that sets out what I think:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't profess to be a qualified historian, but generally my reading has led me to conclude the history of Judah and Israel long pre-dates the advent of Islam.

In their place Arab tribes became the predominate culture even though a significant Jewish population remained.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Hamas totally denies Israel's right to exist and over the next 16 years built a military machine designed to eliminate Israel.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On Oct 7th 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, not on the military establishment, but specifically targeting defenceless civilians at a music festival. Hamas soldiers butchered 1200 civilians including children, they committed despicable crimes of torture, rape and abuse, they then abducted a further 240 defenceless civilians and took them hostage. This was an inhuman act, and they should not have been surprised at Israel's response. What would we expect our government to do if we were attacked in a similar manner?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is my opinion Hamas wanted a strong response from Israel holding the view they could escalate their action into a wider regional war against Israel. They hold their own people in contempt by hiding their military and its firepower within civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals. If the completely one-sided votes supported by the Australian government in the UN, calling for an immediate cease-fire and conditional release of hostages and with no guarantees for Israel had been observed, as they called for, Israel would not have incapacitated Hezbollah over the northern border in Lebanon.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Perhaps this time it will allow the Lebanese to take control of their country, not Iran. That would be an excellent outcome and we should all applaud.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">During the conflict Iran attacked Israel with 3000 missiles in a day. Israel's response was largely to destroy Iran's air force—that can only be a good thing. Along with the depleting of Hamas these three events led to Iran's inability to protect the murderous Assad regime in Syria and again there, we can only hope his removal will allow for a proper and compassionate government to form, one that does not use chemical and biological weapons against its own people. Once again, we should all applaud.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and, I add, if we had had an immediate ceasefire with no conditions in favour of Israel. It was a disgraceful position for the government to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes put forward in this legislation are a step in the right direction. They lower the threshold for criminality. They remove the defence of acting in good faith. They introduce threatening behaviour as an offence. This bill was introduced in September. We are now in February. We have had numerous demonstrations and numerous acts against the Jewish community in that time. What have the government been waiting for? They introduced this legislation in September and knew we would support it, yet here we are debating it in this Chamber five months later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What counts at the end of the day is that we not only make the changes but also require our courts to give appropriate sentencing. At this stage, I'm not aware of a court in Australia giving the kind of penalty for the behaviour we have seen—I'm not aware of any outcome that would meet my threshold. That's why it's important that we move to mandatory sentencing in this area, because it seems that the judiciary are not up to the fight—or they don't realise the gravity of what is happening here, don't think what is happening in Australia today is so different to what was happening in 1932 and 1933 in Germany or don't think that that thin veneer of civilisation can be stripped away from the most urbane of us. If it could happen there, it can happen virtually anywhere. We need to be on our guard right from the first step and stamp out that kind of behaviour. The legislation is good, although it doesn't go far enough, and, of course, I will support it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  The Greens support the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. It will mean that a number of people in our community who in many instances are, tragically, currently targeted by violence will gain some extra protections. People in the LGBTQIA+ community, disabled people and many others who far too often are the subject of violence and threats of violence will now be better protected under this legislation and new offences will be put in place. The expanded list of protected attributes is welcome recognition and a strengthening of our laws to protect these communities. The addition of disability as a protected attribute is long overdue and a much-needed step to combating the ableism and discrimination experienced by disabled people, and, in too many instances, tragically, as the disability royal commission exposed, violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Criminal law alone will not stop hate. Indeed, many experts tell us—and the Greens agree—that if that is all you do, and if you simply do things like attack the rule of law and introduce minimum mandatory sentencing, as the coalition wants to do, you don't make society safer. What we do need is a national human rights act that extends these protections, and we also need the government to urgently fully fund the implementation of the National Anti-Racism Framework to tackle all forms of racism and to invest in responses to hate that are grassroots and community led.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen—not just in recent times but going back over many years, including into the previous government—the rise of white supremacists and the far right in this country, Neo-Nazis, and disturbingly that has been happening for a number of years. We are now seeing antisemitic attacks in Australia, which are to be condemned. We also know that over many years there has been widespread Islamophobia in our country, including leading up to the attacks, and it continues to be widespread. Racism and violence have no place in our country, and we as politicians need to call out that hatred and racism and do what we can to stop it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, as I mentioned before, going back a few years, I remember during the pandemic we saw Neo-Nazis marching and gathering in the Grampians in Victoria, seeking to feed off and encourage fear in our society. It was something that we called out at the time. There was a parliamentary inquiry, and, sadly, that parliamentary inquiry in Victoria found that there had been a rise in right-wing extremism and that it was something that ASIO and our security agencies had been warning previous governments to take seriously for some time. We need to work out how we can get to the root of hate in our society and stop the rise of these elements that aren't just simply about promoting fear online and in words but, in many instances, threatening violence or tragically committing violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are extending criminal law, you must always be careful that you get it right because, when you try and legislate criminal law in haste, there is room for error and unintended consequences. We believe the bill as it stands at the moment has got the balance right, and it's been through an extensive and exhaustive Senate inquiry process. There have been people who have looked at it from the perspective of both ensuring that it doesn't attack the rule of law but also ensuring that it targets that hate that we all want to target, so the Greens support this bill as it's presented here in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I watch with some concern as the opposition, especially as we head towards an election, use every opportunity they can to seek to divide and whip up fear. As they have done for many, many years, the opposition are out there with their attack on judges and the judiciary, calling for mandatory minimum sentencing and to take away the power of judges and the power of the judiciary that is long established in our rule of law and in the separation of powers. The coalition seems to believe that the parliament is in a better position than judges to hear and decide cases. The separation of powers is there for a very real reason, and it's about understanding and respecting the independence of the judiciary and saying to the judiciary, 'Together with juries, your job is to find out whether someone is guilty and then to work out, in those instances, what is the best kind of sentencing to apply.' The coalition attacks the rule of law. They do it regularly. They always do it. I've been in this place long enough now to know the coalition tries to gain votes by punching down all the time. That is what they do. They punch down, they seek to whip up fear, they seek to divide and they seek to attack the rule of law time and time again. That makes society less safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that, with the Greens' support, together with, as I understand it, the support of other members of the crossbench, this bill can pass as is. Perhaps it could have some other minor amendments to fine-tune it, but the bill could essentially pass as is. I urge the government, especially as we head towards an election, not to go and work with the coalition to alter the balance of this bill but to stick with this bill that has got the balance right and to pass it because there are the numbers there in parliament to pass it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also urge the government to look seriously at having a human rights act in this country and to look at the national antiracism framework. The government was provided with a very good and clear blueprint for how we can combat racism in this country in all its forms. It's got the backing of the commission and it sets out in a lot of detail what it would take to actually start to get to the root of some of this to try to stop this kind of hate—stop the antisemitism and stop the Islamophobia—at its source. It's about what we need to do to get to the bottom of that. The framework, in many respects, and the report that led to it pull no punches. They talk about the injustices that exist in this country, and the violence and the dispossession, and they say, 'Here's what needs to be done to address it.' We haven't yet heard a full response from the government or a commitment to fully implementing that framework. Together with legislation like this, that has to be part of tackling hate in this country. I urge the government to seize this opportunity—not to go and do what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, which will ultimately make us less safe and not tackle the root causes, but instead to pass this bill basically as is and to then commit to fully funding and implementing the framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll end where I started: the Greens support this bill and the protections that it gives to those who have been the target of hate crimes and acts of violence. There is no room for violence in our society. Over the last few days and weeks I've been reading the accounts of young men, for example, who get an invitation to go and meet what they think is another man only to be lured into a situation where a number of people descend on them and beat them. For many in our community and for many in the LGBTIQ+ community, that has echoes of violence that has been received in the past, and it's something they had hoped might have been prominent decades ago but was on the decline. There are now many who are feeling fearful about acts and threats of violence. It's not just amongst the queer community, of course; it's amongst First Nations communities as well. We've heard reports from members of the Jewish communities about feeling the fears of threat and violence. We hear from members of the Islamic communities as well. We hear it from members of many communities, but everyone should have the right to feel safe in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament should come together and pass this legislation. We should not have amendments on the run that could potentially have unintended consequences that haven't been through the Senate inquiry process, like substantial amendments that talk about expanding, for example, the scope to include minimum mandatory sentencing. I hope the government sticks to what is said to be Labor Party policy, which is to oppose minimum mandatory sentencing. We've seen them walk away from that once before in this parliament. I hope they don't do it this time. We should pass this legislation essentially as is and then commit ourselves to coming together as a parliament to stamp out all forms of racism through a fully funded and implemented antiracism strategy, as has been recommended to the government. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  First of all, I must take up the Greens leader and member for Melbourne when it comes to some of his colleagues who've been really revving up the crowds and going to violent protests in Melbourne, which, sadly, have been very much against the Jewish community. They are now basically calling for peace and harmony when the Greens leader himself and his Greens colleagues voted so many times against motions supporting the Jewish people in Australia and condemning Hamas. All of a sudden—I think because of election results in Queensland and also some council results—the Greens have realised, 'We might just want to get out there and support the Jewish community a tiny bit.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 is necessary because of repeated failures of the Albanese government—in particular when it comes to the Prime Minister. Rather than stamping out antisemitism right from the start and really showing strong leadership in calling it out, especially when it started at the Opera House in New South Wales—sadly, that hasn't taken place. We're a country that prides itself on treating people equally regardless of faith or background, which is so important. It's a core national value. Antisemitism is a direct rejection of that value and of being Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas is a Palestinian armed group and political movement in the Gaza Strip. We should never forget—and again, I didn't hear the Greens leader say this—why this awful situation has happened. It goes back to 7 October 2023, when Israel was attacked, with Hamas killing around 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages, of which we're now seeing some of the remainder being released. The 7 October attacks are the single greatest loss of Jewish lives on any day since the Holocaust. Jewish businesses, homes, cars and synagogues in Australia have been targeted, and the spread of antisemitism in Australia after 7 October has just been relentless, especially in recent months. It started with those demonstrations. Can I say not everyone's attending those demonstrations for violent means, but sadly they attracted a number of people who were motivated in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, when we've got these violent protests and we have Greens members of parliament attending those—why on earth would you go to a violent demonstration in Melbourne with this awful behaviour? It goes back, again, to Prime Minister Albanese, the leader of the Labor Party. He didn't take decisive action right from the start. He didn't condemn the antisemitic attacks and ensure that offenders faced legal consequences for saying the most awful things about the Jewish community just days after the awful terrorist attack, and we'll call it that, in Israel. There are laws in Australia that he could have directed the AFP and law enforcement agencies to use. The Prime Minister has failed to acknowledge how serious the situation was. He could have used existing laws under division 80 of the Criminal Code against urging violence against groups defined by race or religion, but they weren't used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, two days after this awful attack in Israel, on 9 October, there was a pro-Palestinian protest march from the Sydney Town Hall to the Sydney Opera House. This is where the awful chanting against the Jews happened. I obviously won't repeat what was said. Basically, as Israeli Australians were mourning, they were getting racially abused in our streets outside our famous Sydney Opera House. It then went on to universities, where we had protestors take over campuses. In May 2024, students staged protests at Deakin University, Monash University and the University of Melbourne calling for universities to cut ties with companies linked to Israel, and they sat there. Can I just say, I spoke to a number of Muslim students who were very much intimidated themselves because they felt that the university protests had been infiltrated by others with the view of spreading hatred against the Jewish community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The following are some of the antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne since October 2024. On 25 May 2024, Mount Scopus Memorial College in Melbourne, Australia's largest Jewish school, was graffitied. On 13 October, there was antisemitic graffiti on a Jewish bakery in Sydney, with a note left for the owners reading, 'Be careful.' On 21 November, cars were torched—and this is where the violence really started to happen—and buildings were vandalised in Sydney's east, an area with a large Jewish population. On 6 December, Adass Israel Synagogue was firebombed in Melbourne. This was obviously a terrorist attack. This has now got to the stage of causing mass fear in the Jewish community, where they're targeting their faith and going right after them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 January 2025, a man was charged for allegedly threatening worshippers near the Chabad North Shore synagogue in northern Sydney. We've just had this roll-on of awful attacks against the Jewish people. On 10 January, Allawah synagogue in Sydney's south-west was graffitied with the Nazi hakenkreuz symbol. On 11 January, there was the graffitiing and attempted arson of Newtown Synagogue in Sydney's west. On 11 January, cars were vandalised and graffitied in Sydney. On 16 January, a federal taskforce made its first arrest, charging a man for allegedly making death threats and vandalism. On 17 January, cars were torched and a building formerly owned by a Jewish community leader was vandalised. I'm a former police officer, and it is clear that these attacks are rolling on every couple of days now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big one was on 19 January 2025. A caravan containing explosives was found in Dural, Sydney. Questions were raised to the Prime Minister about whether he was briefed by ASIO and law enforcement and on what day, or whether he did not want to know about it. This is an exceptionally serious matter which could have ended up as Australia's worst terrorist attack. On 21 January, a childcare centre was set alight and graffitied in Sydney's west. On 29 January, a home next to Mount Sinai College in Maroubra, Sydney, was sprayed with antisemitic graffiti. These incidents have caused significant concern and distress for all of our Jewish community. Can I say again, the Prime Minister should have been very strong on this right from the start, instead of trying to walk on two sides of the road at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one point I want to make is that the Nazi symbol targeting the Jewish community has been misconceived as the swastika. As the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, I want to point out that the swastika is actually an ancient and sacred symbol of peace and good fortune for Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and other faith communities. The Nazi symbol targeting the Jewish community is the Nazi symbol of hatred, the hakenkreuz. We have to be very clear about that. The hakenkreuz is a symbol of the Nazi Party, which committed, as we know, the most heinous crimes against humanity, particularly against the Jewish people. Using this hate symbol to intimidate and spread messages of antisemitism and intolerance towards a community in Australia is totally unacceptable and must be prosecuted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is intended to help mitigate some of the government's failures. We have existing offences in division 80 of the Criminal Code that should have been used to stop the spark of antisemitism. Existing offences in division 80 of the Criminal Code make it an offence to urge violence against an individual or group on the basis of race, religion and the like. They make it an offence to advocate terrorism or genocide. For months, the coalition has been calling for these laws to be used, especially the opposition leader, who has been so strong in his support of the Jewish community. We, on this side, have been saying that the existing offences should be tested and those preaching antisemitism should be taken before the courts. Let the courts decide it, and, if there is an issue with the legislation, we can change or amend the legislation in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the belated changes. These changes seek to lower the threshold for criminality for those who urge violence against individuals or groups. Instead of proving that a person 'intended' for violence occur, police now only need to prove that the person was 'reckless'. Can I just say, as a former police officer, that words are key when you have 'must' and 'shall' and 'could'. It is a much higher threshold for the police to prove that the person actually intended for the violence to occur. Now it will be 'reckless'—whether they knew their actions could lead to violence—which obviously makes it a lot easier for police to prosecute. These laws, as currently drafted, remove the good faith defence for those urging violence. This too is a welcome move because you cannot urge someone to engage in acts of violence in good faith. These laws introduce new offences for threatening force or violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, in finishing, my heart goes out to the Jewish community, which has been targeted. Hopefully, these laws will go smoothly through parliament and police will actually use them to prosecute those people who are committing crimes against the Jewish community. </span>

That is the rise of antisemitism, which has grown exponentially since the Hamas terrorist invasion of Israel and the kidnapping and killing of many innocent people. That was a day of murder, torture, kidnapping, brutal sexual violence and the massacring of children and innocents. It was cruel, it was barbaric and it was unbelievable. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet in Australia we saw, on the steps of the Opera House no less, in the middle of Australia at one of Australia's iconic landmarks, ranting and chanting by supporters of Hamas that went unpunished. The law was not enforced by the New South Wales police. I could not believe it at the time. It is an offence to incite people to violence, let alone to give aid to declared terrorist organisations.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr GILLESPIE:</span>
                    </a>  As I was saying, there was a failure to enforce the law in failing to prosecute and in attempting to arrest people who were inciting violence based on the criteria of religious belief. Blatant antisemitism has been uncovered. I'm a big believer in free speech and the right to protest but it's not legal to incite people to violence or to spray-paint businesses' cars and torch them, attack places of religious worship, firebomb children's daycare centres or vandalise people's houses. That is not legitimate political expression; that is illegality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current government have been asleep at the wheel. They have failed to prosecute or—not necessarily the act of arresting; that would be up to state police. But they have failed to condemn. They have failed to condemn universities tolerating the occupy movements plastering universities with antisemitic graffiti, allowing discrimination and the ostracising of both academics and students in universities, doxxing people and actually arguing for the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting a registered terrorist organisation by physical or other means is illegal in this country. But these laws have been left unapplied, and that is why antisemitism has grown. On a diplomatic and international scale, the current government has made moral equivalence a justification for not doing anything because of stuff it feels is Islamophobic. But it's just not realistic. On the international stage we have abandoned our support for Israel. We have voted against Israel, the one democracy in the Middle East that has the rule of law and lets people vote. It's a shame that Australia has really let its standards drop in supporting any of those things I've mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, in putting some teeth behind applying the law, is a little bit too late. We need strong leadership from this government and also from state governments, who should have had their police forces enforcing this. The fact that our security agencies were not engaging with the current federal government tells you enough about their opinion of what's going on in this government. In question time today, we saw the Prime Minister obfuscate. He wouldn't admit that the security agencies didn't want to brief him because they were worried about his administration leaking any information, which would hinder them identifying the perpetrators. The caravan packed with explosives—my goodness!—was an abject failure of our intelligence capability, when local neighbours identified the caravan. It goes on and on. Vandalising synagogues and trying to torch them in Sydney, and then the Adass synagogue in Melbourne, were just absolute shocks. I cannot believe that Australia has let down the standards of applying the rule of law and having a tight, well-connected intelligence network. It really is a cause for concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposed changes seek to lower the threshold for criminality for those that urge violence against individuals or groups. Instead of intending that violence occur, police now only need to prove that the person was reckless as to whether violence would occur. These laws also propose removing the good faith defence for those urging violence. It is really appropriate, because how can you urge someone to engage in acts of violence in good faith. I mean, it's really, totally unrealistic. It's long overdue that the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill has finally been introduced for us to discuss. The coalition did write to the government about it before parliament resumed in October. It's been to a committee and was examined carefully. The recommendation from the review was that this should come before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also needs to be a bit stronger to cover attacks on places of worship. It needs to be blindingly clear that any antisemitic action is not acceptable in Australia. As I have said, the consequences of us being ambiguous about what is tolerable under the law are really important. I do not want to stifle free speech, but free speech doesn't mean you can incite people to violence or say 'kill Jews' or 'kill anyone'. That is a different matter; that is not free speech. That is against the law. I commend these amendments to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that our security agencies do get to the bottom of who has initiated the caravan full of high explosives, and who the people are that are paying some of our gangs—not necessarily people from overseas, but getting local criminals and gangsters to do this for a fee because they need to face the full force of the law as well. There must be jail time for any of this behaviour, otherwise, people will do what they have been doing. They feel like their weird, twisted version of what should be done is being tolerated because silence from the authorities and inaction by the bodies that enforce the law have emboldened them. As I've said, universities have questions to answer about them tolerating support of terrorist organisations in their own institutions and having academics and students afraid to move freely in their own institutions. It really is a wake-up call for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is long overdue, and I support it. Let's hope that Australia gets its strength back and supports Israel. They have an existential question of survival. That's why they went to war against Hamas and Hezbollah. People don't realise that it's not just about the land and occupying areas on the West Bank. There is an administration called Hamas, and there is Hezbollah, which are backed by Iran. Their whole plan is not to just get back a bit of land. They want Israel wiped off the map, and we can't let that happen. What we can do in this country, though, is make it crystal clear that the behaviour we've seen should never have been tolerated and should've been called out when it happened, and then we wouldn't have let this monster out of the bag. We need to put it back in. Antisemitism has been through the ages: the pogroms in the Middle Ages, the pogroms in the Russian Revolution in and after World War I and then again with the Nazi Holocaust. The rest of the world, including Australia, supported the creation of the State of Israel at the United Nations. It has a right to exist, and we in Australia should be supporting that right. We shouldn't be tolerating any more of this horrible behaviour that we've seen in our own country. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the very important Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. I'd like to talk a bit about how we got into this situation, what has happened in Australia, what the response has been, antisemitism in general—because as horrific, distasteful and as outrageous as it is, we need to talk about it—this bill and how the coalition think that it could be made stronger. How did we get here? Well, it's interesting. Antisemitism is one of the oldest hatreds in the world—something we thought probably wasn't under the surface in Australia but that, to our horror, we discovered was there after the horrific acts of October 7. Everyone was shocked that Israel was attacked by Hamas in the way it was. Everyone was shocked the day after that Sunday when we all awoke and saw the news that paragliders, four-wheel-drive utes and all sorts of vehicles with murderous terrorists had gone into these peaceful kibbutzes and communities in southern Israel and committed the most horrific crimes. And the more the week went on, and as footage was released—it was impossible to watch, but you had to watch it to understand exactly what had happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It affected many people in this place very personally for their own reasons. In my case, before coming to parliament I had worked as an agricultural scientist for an Israeli water technology company called Netafim. I was very proud to work for that company, because that company developed water-saving technology that brought agricultural prosperity to many parts of the world—yes, in Australia, where we use it to grow tomatoes and almonds, but also in Third World countries and developing countries. That is Israeli technology that they developed out of necessity. The people who set up the kibbutz that started Netafim in Hatzerim, down in the south of Israel, were working with the government to do what the inventor of drip irrigation, Simcha Blass, said: 'Make the desert bloom.' They could make the desert bloom as long as they could use the very small amount of water they had efficiently, so they developed this technology, which is now used around the world. It brings life to people. At the time, I spoke about my visits to those Israeli communities. Many of them are in the south and many of them are very close to that border.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Netafim is the company that makes the drip irrigation equipment, but there are other companies that make the valves, the filters—everything that gets water to agricultural crops, as the member for Braddon and the member for Forrest, being farmers, well know. It's all technology that's created in these communities, so they're bringing life to the world by making agricultural produce easier to grow. I said at the time that they were obsessed with life. What they were met with was people who were obsessed with death, people who have impossible to understand hatreds—irrational, insane hatreds—to think that they could cross the border and do those things to people. It's one thing in a war zone to attack one another's soldiers, and often, in war, there are civilian casualties that happen because of the nature of conflict, but these were people deliberately going and murdering civilians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That they'd suffered should've sparked a great deal of sympathy for the Israeli people; instead, in some quarters in Australia, it unleashed burgeoning antisemitism. We saw that with the way that people gathered at the Opera House and with the chants they were making. We've seen it since. A lot of that happened before Israel's military response, and people said: 'This isn't antisemitism. We're just against what Israel is doing in their attempts to defend themselves.' A lot of these protests happened before those military operations started—let's not deny that. But, since then, Israel launched some military actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A debate about what Israel is doing is legitimate. Targeting Australian Jewish people because of it is not, and that's what's been happening. It's happened at the Opera House, at MPs offices and at my office in a small way. I mention this because I've had experience of 'Free Palestine' stickers being put and texta drawn all over my office. But I was disgusted with what happened to my friend—a person on the other side of the chamber that I met since I came to this place—the member for Macnamara. I play sport with him of a morning up here, and it's been my great honour to get to know him. For him and his staff to go through what they did at his office is against the foundations of democracy, and it's against a member. The member for Macnamara and I disagree on policy, but we are friends, as I am with the member for Hunter, and I felt that personally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously there's been a great deal of debate about the response since. I thought that the Leader of the Opposition's response had a real moral clarity to it. He spoke in parliament about what was chanted at the Opera House, and that was really uncomfortable for all of us. He didn't use the exact words, but he alluded to them. I saw a lot of people around the House being critical of the opposition leader bringing them up, but you have to say this stuff to face the evil of it. He did that and he's been steadfast since. I think that he's shown real leadership on this issue even when it's got pretty difficult, and I commend him for that. There are people in the Australian Labor Party who have shown some leadership, but, overall, I would say that the response has been too equivocal, and the Jewish community has felt that the response hasn't been strong enough. It hasn't had that moral clarity that we need to face this evil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to talk a little bit about antisemitism as one of the world's oldest hatreds. In my experience, you go back in your own mind and try to think about what you know, what you understand and what forms your view. I've talked a bit about my experiences in Israel, but, even before that, I remember my experience in the late eighties, when I would've been in my early to mid-teens. As I've said in this place, in the country you only had two channels, but I was allowed to watch the late movies sometimes when my parents didn't know that I was up watching the late movie. There was a TV movie on called <span style="font-style:italic;">Escape from Sobibor</span>, and it showed, in graphic terms, what the Nazis were doing to the Jewish population in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s and why the West had the moral clarity to wage war against that evil regime and to stop antisemitism in its tracks. I mention that because what we saw in the 1940s is what this sort of thinking and this sort of evil, when it gets going, can lead to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the response from the opposition leader has had a moral clarity, and his writing to the Prime Minister to convene the National Cabinet on this was the right move. To push for this sort of thing and to keep the pressure on—which is what oppositions do—was the right move. Government take credit for coming out and saying, 'We're going to do something,' but often they do something because of the pressure the opposition puts on them. This bill is an example of that. This bill has come about because of the pressure applied by the opposition. I want to give a shout out to the member for Berowra, who's also shown equal moral clarity based on his own experiences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself—the changes are welcome. I think they're too late, but we have to do this. We should have done it a long time ago, but we are doing it now. That's a good thing. There are some simple straightforward steps that the government are proposing to take. Those steps lower the threshold for criminality, particularly for those who urge violence against individuals or groups. Instead of proving that the person intended that the violence occur, the police now only need to prove that the person was reckless as to whether the violence would occur, and that is a welcome change. These laws remove the good faith defence for those urging violence. As the previous speaker, the member for Lynes, said, you can't urge violence in good faith, not in this situation. It's a welcome change. There's also some expansion of the offences that relate to the urging of violence in relation to a range of personal characteristics on the basis of which a person or a group is targeted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked about what's happened to MPs' offices, what happened at the Opera House, the spray painting of cars and the targeting of people because of what they were wearing. All of this is anathema to what modern Australian values should be. But the worst thing happened late last year. Ironically for me, I was at the Israeli Embassy. I was there that day with the Israeli and German ambassadors. They're neighbours in Canberra; the German and Israeli embassies are next door to each other. The two ambassadors came together to commemorate a person from my electorate—an Indigenous Yorta Yorta man called William Cooper—who, in the 1930s, took a petition to the German consulate in Melbourne on behalf of the Jewish people and was turned away. There was a plaque to commemorate him. We celebrated that plaque the very day that there was a synagogue firebombing in Melbourne. If you didn't understand the necessity for these laws and the fact that they need to go further to protect places of worship, then that was your answer of what there needed to be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That synagogue bombing was an outrage, and it's really rocked—everyone is experiencing that. But there are those of us who are from Victoria and understand those parts of Melbourne, like Caulfield and Brighton, where Jewish people, who make such a contribution to our region, have congregated and live in Melbourne. What a contribution they've made, through business and arts, to our community. For one of their places of worship to be firebombed by some coward or cowards is an outrage. It goes against everything we believe and everything all of us want Australia to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do in this place and the messages we send matter. I hope people get prosecuted. I hope people get caught. I hope they get prosecuted by these laws. I hope that this makes the prosecution of them easier. I hope that this makes the capture of them easier. I hope that this means the punishment can be harsher, but, even if it doesn't, the fact that we're passing this legislation is a message from this place to say that antisemitism will not be tolerated in Australia. Antisemitism is an outrage. It's a hatred that should have died in ashes of 1945 in World War II, when many of our brave Australian servicepeople and, indeed, many from the United States and the United Kingdom fought against that evil regime to put a stop to antisemitism once and for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing it rear its head again here. This parliament needs to send a very strong message that this is not tolerated. This bill's a start, but it needs to go further. We've got some amendments that take this further that I hope the government will consider. We should not only be passing legislation; we've all got to be really strong in our statements about this scourge. I urge the Prime Minister and anyone in a position of leadership to look at the way that the opposition leader acted in the days when this was getting a foothold and to use that moral clarity to guide them in their attack on antisemitism.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  It saddens me today and it's with a very heavy heart that I rise to speak on the second reading of the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. It saddens me because, whilst this is necessary at this point in time in Australia's history, the way I and most Australians view it, it should never be necessary. It should have been stamped out from the very start. It shouldn't have been allowed to escalate to the levels, the hurt and evil, that it has got to at this point in time. It's for that very reason that it saddens me that the leadership has been lacking for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from the profession of arms, and I have spent the majority of my life being deployed to all sorts of places for that very reason—to combat evil. Mostly<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>we stand in front of those being persecuted with a weapons system, and we protect them from that evil. I know a little bit about wiping evil out and eliminating evil from the earth. There's an old saying that goes right back to the Romans; it's in Latin, and it's the phrase, 'Si vis pacem, para bellum.' That means, 'In strength, comes peace.' Unless you have strength and unless you have the leadership that demonstrates that, you will never have peace. Unfortunately, that's what we have gotten to. That lack of leadership has allowed this festering serpent to develop and grow to the point that it is spitting venom at those most vulnerable. I think the actions of this government have lacked that leadership, that strength, that power and that force in stamping this out, and that's why that escalation has taken place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually visited Israel last year at the request of my good friend the ambassador, Amir Maimon. Amir served a life in the Israeli special forces, Mossad. He was an electronic warfare special forces operator working for the Israeli Army around the same time as I was posted in the Middle East. We have a kinship there, and we have become very close. I saw a very hardened man, a tough man, a strong man, a man with conviction and leadership, a man that deeply loves his country and was in another country representing the interests of Israel and the relationship between Australia and our friends in Israel, that great democracy. I saw him heartbroken. I saw him bent over heartbroken because of what was happening to his beautiful country and his beautiful people. Unprovoked, a listed terrorist organisation—the head of evil—attacked their precious country, leaving 1,200 people dead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited the kibbutz Kfar Aza down south. You could see the photos. They had photos up outside the kibbutz. You could see the bloodstains and the bullet chips inside. You could smell after they had been there—these horrible, evil creatures—and burnt the place. This evil was committed in places that were supposed to be secure. There was no warning. Those hostages that were taken—can you imagine what that would be like in your town or suburb where you live today? Can you imagine what it would be like if 240 people were taken hostage, sexually abused and mutilated?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a thing called the '46 minutes', and it's chest cam footage which they captured of Hamas operatives. They were proud and boasting of killing, beheading, mutilating and raping. There were dead bodies of innocent Israelis. You imagine what would happen if that happened here. In retaliation and in trying to get those hostages back, we went on a world quest on who was right and who was wrong. And so the chants began. And so the hitchhikers jumped onto this thing that got a few headlines. If you ask those people chanting 'from the river to the sea' what river and what sea, they wouldn't have a clue about that, what it means or the destruction that I've just described. They wouldn't have a clue. They were just there for the headline, for the footage and to get on television. And that's when the government should have stepped in and been strong, and that's when that head should have been cut from that evil snake. Now that snake has bred, and there are many serpents all over the place, conducting evil on our beautiful country. It should have been stomped out and wiped out a long time ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's with a heavy heart that I have to talk about this. My good friend—he's been like a brother to me—Josh Frydenberg has been on the offensive on the reactive trail, trying to get the message across about how important it was for the government to step up. He turned himself inside out to get this message across. Whilst he's done a fantastic job, and I congratulate my brother in doing that, it fell on deaf ears. It has not been until now, when that evil has been allowed to escalate, develop and dig in, that we've decided to finally do something about it. I worry that this measure is all happening far too late.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that I want to raise is in relation to this bill. Whilst it's all well and good to have a Criminal Code amendment to this bill so that we can prosecute evildoers, this is a cultural act, and this cultural act needs to be cut off at the knees. It's up to every leader at every level—at state level, local government level and community group level; it's up to every person on the street—to condemn this as strongly as possible. I'm not talking about vigilante action, but what I am talking about is that if they know that everybody condemns this in such a bitter way then they might cease and desist a little. If we don't give them the air they so desperately need, and the fanfare and the headlines, then maybe they mightn't be so keen to recommit the same offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My Jewish brothers and sisters—and I mentioned this in my valedictory speech when I was describing Peter Dutton, and I meant it from the bottom of my heart when I said it: I have faith in him, I see a strength in him and I see moral courage in him. I know that you, Peter Dutton, will protect that little girl that is too frightened to go to school because she is Jewish. That's not the Australia I grew up in, and that's not the Australia he believes in either. That's the sort of leadership we should have had 12 months ago on this. That's the sort of leadership Australia really needed. That's the sort of leadership that will return Australia back to the great country it's always been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The actual bill itself amends many things. Apart from a deterrent, it also gives the ability to remove the offender from the ability to recommit the same offence. While that's a good thing, that needs to be strengthened. I don't feel this bill is anywhere near strong enough. As far as I'm concerned, if you are going to commit such an evil act that is so against Australian values, Australian culture and traditions and the very essence of what we stand for as a country, the very accepting non-racist country that we stand for—if you are going to act and carry on like that, then there's no place for you here as far as I'm concerned. They're the sorts of measures that I think need to be looked at when we start being serious about developing this particular legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think after this episode, and with some strong leadership and some strong guidance in stamping this out, we can return to that country that I'm so proud of—a country that accepts people from all over the world irrespective of their race, their religion, the colour of their skin or anything else for that matter. We value you as a human being, the very essence of your soul, your heart. That's what it means to be an Australian. To be an Australian in relation to the matters I'm talking about today means joining with our Jewish friends, supporting them and espousing this terrible, heinous crime we're talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem doesn't necessarily stop with this particular issue, the antisemitism issue that I'm talking about. I'm concerned about where this starts and stops: where does this end up? It's very similar to any action. If you allow one little thing to happen, then it will escalate and something else will happen. So what next? Does that then lead to attacks on the Catholic Church or the Anglican Church? Does it stop with childcare centres? Where does this stop? That's what I'm getting back to. If we don't apply that age-old theory of 'in strength comes peace', if we don't apply enough strength, then that serpent will continually strike, and it will come back, it will return, in even stronger forms. That's what I fear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we're sitting here debating this particular amendment bill, I wonder whether it's simply something we have to have to keep the masses quiet. If it had come 12 months ago, maybe it would have come as a normal means of governance, good leadership and applying strength. The weakness has let in evil. That evil has developed. Innocent people are being hurt. Innocent people, their hopes and dreams, their security, are being crushed. Not many people in this place and not many people watching this particular show on television today know what it's like to have your life in the wind, where it's here one second and gone the next. That's what those Jewish people in those communities feel. They're wondering whether they're going to make it home. Imagine your own children. They're our brothers and sisters. Israel is our friend. They still haven't got their people home. They still haven't got their daughters and sons home. There's still damage there. Those bullet holes and that bloodstained wall that I talked about are still there. Those scars will never leave. They will never heal. But the last thing we need is more damage and more evil because we simply aren't applying enough strength. And that's all I say today. Si vis pacem, para bellum; in peace, we need strength.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  Just yesterday, before the commencement of the parliamentary year here in 2025, many members from right across parliament came together at St Christopher's Cathedral for what I see as almost a traditional display of unity and togetherness—a reminder that, often, there are many things that bring us together and less that keeps us apart. That ecumenical prayer service, which has been going for more than 50 years now, is something which is a reminder for each and every one of us that the words that we say in this parliament matter. It is critical that we should be working for the common good. And, really, that's the frame for this legislation. It comes also a week after I was at the National Jewish Memorial Centre in Forrest—which is only really a stone's throw from St Christopher's Cathedral—to announce the investment by the Albanese government of $4 million for a Holocaust education resource to ensure that, for generations to come, they continue to know the story about the absolute horror of the Holocaust. We can't neglect the importance of education in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting to this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024, of course, creates new criminal offences and strengthens existing offences against hate speech. That's the key and heart of this. The amendments in this proposed legislation protect groups distinguished by their race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability, and members of those groups. This bill would strengthen existing offences relating to urging violence against a group or a member of a group. They apply where a person urges others to use violence against a group or a member of a group and is reckless as to whether the violence urged will occur. This bill will also create a new criminal offence for threatening force or violence against a group or members of a group to cover conduct involving a direct threat from one person to another. And it amends the existing offences of publicly displaying prohibited hate symbols, specifically to cover targeted groups distinguished by those factors that I outlined but, in particular, by existing attributes of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion or national or social origin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sends a clear and unambiguous message that urging or threatening violence and advocating acts of hatred are not acceptable in our country. It is criminal behaviour and will be treated as such. This should be a unity ticket for this parliament. This is something that should bring together people from across the aisle and across all different political groupings in the parliament. It's important. The Australian people are looking to us to show that sense of unity and to show that sense of togetherness that, as I outlined, was pretty clearly present at that prayer service before we commenced parliament this year. Often, the challenge with such services is to ensure the messages that we hear there actually get past question time on the first day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill sends a clear and unambiguous message that urging or threatening violence and advocating acts of hatred are not acceptable in our country. It is criminal behaviour and it will be treated as such. There is clear concern from key parts of our community, quite understandably, about such actions occurring right across our community. The criminal offences that are outlined in this bill will support law enforcement's ability to disrupt, investigate and protect against the activities of those who foster hatred and incite violence, discrimination and other serious damage. The offences in this bill complement existing Commonwealth, state and territory civil and criminal protections against hate speech. The offences in this bill have been carefully crafted to target the most serious forms of harmful hate speech—namely the urging and threatening of force or violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The robust expression of diverse opinions is an important feature of our democracy, and the measures in this bill respect the need for vibrant public debate. The offences are not intended to criminalise mere expressions of belief or opinion. But what we're seeing in Sydney, in particular, is not expressions of robust, diverse opinions. They have been expressions of hatred and they have been designed to incite racial hatred. It's important that, where we can, we send the message that we are working together and that this is a shared mission of this parliament. Wherever there's a sense that there is division or dissent on these matters, it's fodder for those who are trying to foment this hatred across our communities. It certainly doesn't reflect the concerns that have been raised by local communities in my electorate of Bean and across the Canberra community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that this parliament passes legislation like this before we depart this fortnight. It's critical that this federal parliament is seen to act and actually get through key changes because this is the sort of leadership that our communities are looking for. They see it as our responsibility. Whether you're coming from the regions or from the cities, whatever state or territory you might come from, these are issues that should be bringing us together. We have a responsibility to act together, and I support the resolution. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I rise to speak in support of Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. I speak—I am putting on my hat—as someone who came to this country as a 12-year-old child in 1984. I grew up here as an 'other'—a child of migrants. During my childhood and my adolescence, from time to time, I did encounter racism. There's no question about that. It sort of comes with the territory, if you like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially, it was overt, and then, as I grew older and became an adult and started seeking job opportunities, it was probably more covert. However, at no time did I have to encounter the kind of systemic and degrading hate that my Jewish community are now experiencing. I didn't wake up to street corners being defaced. I didn't wake up to schools turning into battlegrounds. I didn't wake up to entire communities feeling like they were under threat. In fact, my experience was quite the opposite; there were intermittent episodes of racism but, because it was not systemic, I still felt and was able to build a sense of belonging in this country. It was not robbed from me in the way my Jewish community are currently experiencing. At no time did I feel like I was an alien in my own country. In fact, it was quite the contrary; I grew up and I thrived, thanks to the welcoming nature of my fellow Australians. It was a nation that changed with me and became far more diverse as I grew.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm now standing here as a parliamentarian in a country that I don't recognise. I don't understand what is going on in this country that is making it acceptable for some people—and they are a minority—to walk around spreading hate against a community of fellow Australians. I just don't understand it. My Jewish community, for context, is large. I have around 6,500 Australians who have a Jewish heritage. This community are highly active. They are contributors. Many of them have been here for multiple generations. They are overwhelmingly descendants of Holocaust survivors. In fact, the largest community of Jews who are descended from those who survived the Holocaust live in Melbourne. This is baked into their DNA, and it is spread from one generation to another. They're acutely attuned to the vibrations that can tear at our social fabric and can lead to the Shoah, the Holocaust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community are active in every single domain right across the economy, from business to professionals to creatives. They are also philanthropists—some of the most generous people who have decided that they want to give back to our country. They have prospered through their work ethic, and they have contributed back to every domain, whether it be in the arts community, business, health or research—particularly in medical research. These people are contributors to our country, yet they now feel like they are aliens in their own land, vilified and made to feel 'other'—isolated. To be honest, they are frightened. Their livelihoods and their lives feel like they are under threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call out special thanks and tribute to my Chabad centre in Malvern. I spoke of people who contribute. These are people who contribute. They run an early childhood education and care centre which employs non-Jewish childcare workers who choose to work there because of the culture of the place. It is so welcoming and warm and it is a proud institution that champions the Jewish faith and inculcates it in small children. I want to also pay special thanks to Rabbi Velly from Chabad Malvern who, of his own accord and with minimal training, set up a mental health group for men. As you all know, I am chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Health. He did this because he found that there was a need for men in the shadows, not just in the Jewish community but also outside that community, to speak about their lived experience, particularly with respect to addiction: a taboo within a taboo. He runs, on a regular basis, a small community group of men who come together to talk about addiction. He links this program of care with the spiritual journey of what it is to be a Jew, because that is how he expresses his Jewish faith—as service unto others. The group is attended by Jewish men as well as non-Jewish men. That tells you something about the sense of giving that the Jewish community has towards the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own community, I also want to call out and pay tribute to King David School. This a truly wonderful school that sits on the more progressive end of the Jewish spectrum. It is a heterogenous group of people, like everyone else in Australia; you can't just dump us all into buckets. There is a mosaic within communities and within minorities. This school links antiquity to modernity. It bakes in at every level—from the early learning centre all the way to year 12—the importance of the Jewish faith, Judaism and linkages to Israel. I had the honour of opening one of the rooms in their early childhood education centre which is named after a particular type of wheat that is regarded as a staple in the Jewish faith and has sustained the people of Israel. The King David School, while embedding the Jewish faith and pride in their students, very much promotes a perspective that is outward looking in their students. The students are not sheltered and are not taught to become insular—quite the opposite. In year 9, they send these students out to engage with the rest of the community. Right now, it's pretty hard for those kids. Do they feel safe entering the wider, mainstream community as young Jewish kids? Do they even wear their uniforms? Occasionally, they don't. Do they wear their jewellery that declares that they are Jewish? They often conceal it, because right now things are not safe. This is a country I do not recognise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this Jewish community that I got to know and learned so much from, I went to Israel twice. I'm the only parliamentarian who visited Israel twice last year. The first visit was in July, by invitation from the speaker of the parliament, to visit the Knesset. It was extraordinary. I went with a multipartisan group of other parliament members. We had the honour of visiting many, many sights in Israel—Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Be'er Sheva where the ANZACs fought. We also had the opportunity to visit the Palestinian Authority and engage with the then Palestinian leadership in Ramallah. It was an eye-opener. At the time, Israel was gripped by protests over the proposed changes to the judicial system. It was really hot, and in the heat—40-degree days—you could see thousands of people, sometimes young families with children strapped to their backs, holding the Israeli flag and marching. Thousands and thousands of people would do that. You could not miss these protests. It showed me how passionate Israelis are about their country, their system of government and their democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second visit was in December in the aftermath of October 7. I was offered this trip to go on. It was sponsored by AIJAC. My colleague Josh Burns, the member for Macnamara, and other members from the coalition attended. I didn't hesitate when given the opportunity. Why? Because I wanted to see for myself what had happened. Until then I had read about it in the media, but I wanted to remove that filter of the media and those biases; there always are biases when you read or consume media. I wanted to see it for myself, and I wanted to go in support of, and show my support in a very tangible way to, my Jewish community. There are things I saw which I cannot unsee. There are smells that I smelt which I cannot forget. I remember there was a moment when I stood at a site in Sderot, a town that had its police station demolished. It took a bulldozer, and it took gunships dropping bombs for about 17 hours to demolish this police station, with terrorists, policemen and service personnel inside because the walls were fortified. I stood on that site, which was basically levelled, with a few bits of concrete and debris, and gave a TV interview. I could smell death rising up from the earth. I'm a doctor; I've smelt death before. It's not something that I will ever forget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I did not expect, though, was to see the level of antisemitism unleashed against Jewish Australians here when I returned. My community warned me from the very beginning that this would escalate, and that if you give antisemitism a foothold, give it an inch, it will accelerate. That is exactly what has happened. That is exactly what has played out, because the Jews are the canaries in the coalmine. We have absolutely seen that happen in 2025, where this has become a daily occurrence in this country. It's completely unacceptable. But I knew this, because I'd also had the opportunity in July last year to visit Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial. For those of you who cannot get there in person, I suggest you educate yourselves by jumping online and having a look at the Yad Vashem website or visiting one of your local Holocaust museums in your major cities. Soon there will be a national museum built here in Canberra with funding we have provided. But it shows how antisemitism, once it takes hold, can lead to the worst possible outcome: mass murder on a scale humanity has never seen—systematised, calculating and highly effective. It happened because of dehumanisation of the Jews. It happened because of centralisation of power. It happened because of propaganda. It happened because of demagoguery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow Australians, those elements are universal; they can happen again and again. So to think this will never happen again is a delusion. It can absolutely happen again if the circumstances are right and if those ingredients are allowed to take a foothold and thrive. It starts with dehumanising the 'other'. In some cases it's racism against people like me or people who look like me or people who are First Nations Australians. In other cases it's antisemitism. It starts with microaggressions. It starts with hate. It starts with language that makes the other feel like they don't belong there, and it robs them of their identity. Hence, I support this bill, which builds upon all the other measures this Albanese government has delivered, from outlawing the Nazi salute to the trade of Nazi symbols to anti-doxxing laws—which, unfortunately, happened again in the aftermath of Jewish creatives being doxxed but will also benefit others, particularly women, because women are the ones who get doxxed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to my final point that although these laws are occurring in the context of unacceptable, virulent and rising antisemitism in this country, these laws will actually benefit everyone in this country. That, if there is a silver lining to this horror, is the gift of this moment. I thank the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  On 26 January, Australia Day, I think everyone in this room would have been out and about in their communities, celebrating a day when all parts of our community come together to celebrate the Australian story and, more importantly, the Australian way. It's a story that's painted through a tapestry of rich multiculturalism and diversity, the coming together of a group of people to create one story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to be able to be in Gawler to help swear in a new raft of Australian citizens, and the joy on their faces to finally be able to say that they're Australian—there was nothing that was going to upset their day. That was replicated right across my electorate, in Playford and the City of Salisbury, and beyond my boundaries as well, in South Australia and across the country. It's a really important point to make because, at the same time we were all coming together to celebrate who we are as Australians, we had a group of people that were trying to drive a wedge of division between our communities, a group who have tried to prey on individuals who are susceptible to impressionism. When I think about this group—and there are not a lot of things that I have to say about them that are nice—they prey on young individuals within our communities who are disenfranchised, hoping they can create a sense of faux outrage and turn that into a tool to assist in their desire to drive a wedge between communities like mine. I'm talking about the National Socialist Network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Australia Day, they used that day of all days to march down North Terrace in Adelaide chanting, 'Australia for the white man!' wearing their black clothing and carrying on in front of our war memorial, displaying their symbols of hatred, trying to strike fear and division in my community and the community of South Australia, which is really disappointing. It's disappointing for a couple of reasons. When I got elected to this place in May 2022, I did so on the basis that I saw myself as a leader in my community. I was very privileged to have the opportunity to get the confidence of my community to represent them in this place. It makes me think about what good leadership is about, and, since my election to this place, I have had the good opportunity to be part of the Defence Force parliamentary program. I had the opportunity to go on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Rankin</span>. It's pertinent when I think about this bill and what this bill does because the motto of that vessel is 'defend the weak'. When you look up the definition of 'defend' in the dictionary it says it's 'to resist an attack made on someone or something, to protect from harm or danger'. The definition of 'weak' is 'liable to break or give way under pressure'. Defend the weak—that's what good leaders do and that's what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2025, enables leadership to stamp out hate and hate crimes. It's about making sure that those who have ill will towards others in our community are held to the highest standards of our laws, as they should be. If you want to urge violence and encourage others to engage in your activities, there will be repercussions. That's exactly what needs to happen. It's not good enough to have people sitting on YouTube or at kickboxing events in the northern suburbs, walking down the main street letterboxing and doorknocking in my electorate, and inciting hatred to persecute your desire to have a white society and drive out the best thing that makes my community so fantastic—that is, the multicultural aspect. It's the bringing together of different cultures harmoniously and creating a society that is interconnected and so much better for it because we get to share everybody's experiences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't have to live in fear. We shouldn't have to worry about elements of our community applying pressure and trying to break the weak. That's why it's up to leaders like myself and others in this chamber today to ensure that we do defend the weak and that we stand up and call out the actions of those like the National Socialist Network, an extremist group that is trying to drive fear into the very hearts of our communities and trying to create an us-versus-them mentality that looks to ostracise anybody that they can for the purposes of their own gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud of this legislation. I think that the minister has done a great job in bringing this forward. It's much needed, unfortunately. It shouldn't be needed. Much like the member for Higgins said, when I came to this place, the last thing I thought that we would be debating is this type of legislation because I just didn't think that we were at this point in our communities. I thought we were well past this. This is a thing of yesteryear. I thought we'd learnt from our mistakes, but, clearly, that's not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do better. We must do better, and that's what this bill seeks to do.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  From the outset, I really want to pick up where the previous speech left off. I commend the Attorney-General for bringing the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 to the House. It hasn't been a quick thing. I know, from hearing the Attorney-General report to the government caucus room and to caucus committees and from talking with colleagues about the development of this bill, which was introduced last year and extensively considered through the proper parliamentary processes, that this is something that he is rightly personally proud of and has put a lot of careful intellectual thought into with extensive consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are complex areas of legislation, as we know, because they intersect with state and territory regimes and balance competing rights. These are always, rightly so, contested bills in a democracy because, when you're measuring one set of rights—and some would rightly say freedom of speech is of critical value in our society, but freedom of speech is not unlimited. It never has been. You can't incite people to violence. You can't defame people. You can't breach national security classifications. In any decent society, there have always been some limits to freedom of speech, and, in this case, there are a complex set of things that we balance. But it is a significant piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let there be no doubt at the outset that the government is committed to protecting the community from those amongst us who would promote extremism, violence or hatred or seek to incite violence. That's a values based commitment. No Australian should be targeted because of who they are or what they believe, and the government has worked diligently to introduce this legislation to create new criminal offences and to also strengthen the protections against hate crimes within existing criminal offences. The bill will create new criminal offences for directly threatening the use of force or violence against a group or a member of a group. I've had a lot of emails from people who are a bit confused asking, 'Does it protect this characteristic or this group?' Importantly, these offences will protect groups or members of groups distinguished by race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, disability, nationality, national or ethnic origin, or political opinion. They will provide protection to Australians right across the community from hate speech and from those who would urge violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make a couple of contextual remarks though. I believe we're the world's most successful multicultural society—one of the most diverse societies on the planet. We can run a bit of a book with Canada, but I'll claim we're the most successful! But just being a diverse society is not the same thing as being a successful multicultural society. We can all think of countries that are diverse that are not successful. Indeed, the member for Wentworth recommended a book when we caught up for a cup of tea last year, and, I will admit I didn't finish it over the summer as I promised—I'll give you this confession now!—but I did get through another couple of chapters. Part of the thesis of that book was observing that, if you look through history, most diverse societies—the Ottoman Empire and other places we could mention—were actually run by authoritarian rulers. The notion of a modern liberal democratic polity existing with the level of human diversity that we have—be it faith, linguistic, cultural or ethnic—is actually a very new notion; it's, some would say, only decades old in the whole of human history. So the jury's out. People in 200 years will look back and see how we did. Hopefully there'll still be a peaceful, democratic, diverse society that we've bequeathed to them, those who come after us, but we can't take our success for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Success, in my view, has three key attributes. First is legal foundations and political intent. This year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Whitlam Labor government's introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act, having abolished the last vestiges of the old, racist White Australia policy. That act has stood the test of time laying the legal foundations, but it alone has not been enough. There are other things that we've had to layer on in that task of trying to maintain a cohesive society in the face of all this diversity and these conflicting views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, as you would know, Deputy Speaker Payne, is investment. Often that's helping new people settle in. The member for Banks over there also represents a diverse electorate. You have to sometimes give some people a bit more help than others to get on their feet, set up life here and succeed. It is investing to allow people to celebrate and cherish their cultural traditions, to pass them on, and, importantly, to share them with the broader community. Again, that takes investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in my view, the magic ingredient, the secret sauce, of success is leadership at all levels—political leadership, faith leadership, interfaith work and community leadership. Day in, day out, it's the community leaders, the volunteers and the people on committees and organisations who do that work of building our social cohesion and maintaining it. Social cohesion is not an end state; it's inherent in the word 'cohesion'. 'To cohere' means to come together. Social cohesion is a dynamic process. We can't take it for granted. When we face stresses and strains on our social cohesion, which I'll touch on in a moment, as we are at this time in our history, we've got to look at all aspects of that formula. Where do we need to strengthen our legal regimes and our protections? This is a good example, where the government is of the view that we need to strengthen the legal protections and the regimes which exist to protect people from hate speech and to allow people to be themselves, whatever that means, and to be safe in the community. It means investing, as the government is, but it also means thinking about leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I learnt a really important lesson in my first six months here, in 2016. I arrived in Canberra bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and full of good ideas, and I was shocked to discover that the then government's main legislative priority—which consumed the then government party room, with Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison and the whole rotten cabal of the IPA—was to weaken the Racial Discrimination Act. That's what they came to Canberra to do. They don't like to talk about that now, because the Labor Party worked with the Jewish community and the multicultural communities of this country to fight and stop the then Liberal government weakening the Racial Discrimination Act. It's a shameful moment in our history, and the leadership lesson that I learnt then was that the words that are said in this parliament and the things that leaders do in this country have real-world impacts. What we saw with that rotten government—and the now opposition leader was right at the heart of this nasty little tawdry campaign—was a spike in racism. People with black skin got abused on public transport. In my community, Muslim women had headscarves ripped off. Sikh guys had their turbans ripped off. Jewish people were bagged in the street for showing the articles of their faith. The leadership lesson I took was: 'Don't be like the Liberal Party. Don't try to divide the community and chase votes based on dog whistling.' Sadly, that's what we're seeing. The Attorney-General rightly described the Leader of the Opposition's disgusting attempts to politicise antisemitism and chase votes as grotesque.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a serious issue, and I know the member for Wentworth and the member for Macnamara over there feel this as much as or more than anyone in this parliament, given what you two have experienced in your community. It's a serious issue, and it shouldn't be politicised. They call for laws on doxxing. They don't like to talk about the fact they voted against the laws on doxxing last year, despite calling for them. Despite the fact they're still trying to claim credit for them, they actually voted against them. So let's see where their vote lands this time. They weren't in favour of this legislation late last year. Let's see how they vote now. The strains on our social cohesion are real. The horrific series of antisemitic incidents in capital cities is probably the most visible sign of that. But there are other forms of discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's racism. The Anti-Racism Framework released by the Human Rights Commission last year called that out. In my community, I don't have a large Jewish community, though I was mayor of a council, I think in the member for Macnamara's electorate, which has the largest Jewish community. We have old and close connections with the conservative and the progressive elements of the Jewish community, if you want to call it that, despite some of the rubbish that gets written in certain media outlets. But in my community, it's Islamophobia. We've seen, since the conflict in the Middle East, more public abuse and personal intimidation of mainly Muslim women going about their business. They'll be shopping with their kids and get abused in the street. There's homophobia. It's all the forms of discrimination that this bill seeks to address. The government is committed to protecting the entire community from those who want to promote extremism or hatred or incite violence. There's no place for that stuff in our diverse society—none whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I decry the politicisation of this. I'll touch on some aspects of the bill. Actually, no, I just want to say a little more on that point on social cohesion. The Scanlon Foundation's work is actually the longest-running longitudinal study examining social cohesion that we've found anywhere in the world. It's not perfect—people can critique the methodology, and that's perfectly legitimate—but the fact that it's longitudinal, even if you want to argue about the questions, means it does give you a year-on-year comparison to see how things are going. To be glass-half-full, what it showed last year was actually no change in the headline measure of social cohesion. Pleasingly, despite all of the strains on society, the percentage of Australians who support our multicultural society, support its character and celebrate their identity as Australians didn't show a major change. I think it went from about 85 to 81. That's a canary in the coalmine. You don't want to see that stuff go down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we did see was a significant rise in the number of Australians holding antisemitic views, and, actually, an even more significant rise in the number of Australians holding Islamophobic views. That's what the data said. They're two particular indices that, for obvious reasons, they've measured for some years. We saw a correlating rise in negative attitudes towards people of faith generally. We've unpicked that a bit. We did it informally. I've talked a bit about this in speeches. The reality of life in modern Australia is that global conflicts and global events do impact daily life here. We're a globally connected society. What happens in the world impacts our communities, be it through family, friends, loved ones, social media, care for homelands and so on. That said the vast majority of Australians don't want global conflicts to rip apart our society. I've called out repeatedly what the Greens political party have done, spreading lies and active disinformation. Again, at the other side of the political spectrum, they've trying to profit electorally, harvest a few votes—it has been a difficult time to govern. We're standing in the centre of that and trying to, I think, do what the vast majority of Australians want, which is not to divide our society and not to see our workplaces, schools, sporting clubs, public transport and public events divided by a global conflict because people in the Liberal Party on the one hand and the Greens political party on the other want to try and chase a few votes by weaponising this conflict here. The vast majority of Australians sit in the middle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also true, I think, that most Australians think: 'Not my cup of tea, mate. You do your thing; I'll do mine.' But they don't like to see faith groups fighting. That's not part of our tradition. I think some of that rise in negative attitudes is actually explained by what is a pretty benign and decent response: 'Just don't bring that stuff here. We don't want to see the fight. You have your view; I'll have mine. We can talk about it.' We need to rediscover the art, in our diverse society, of disagreeing agreeably. I pay tribute to those interfaith leaders who are quietly looking at ways to start to bridge those gaps and restart some dialogue. It's been one of the saddest things to see—the breakdown of decades-old interfaith relationships over this conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Burke has said, if ever there were a time for the Muslim incantation—inshallah or God willing—it would be in response to the ceasefire and the current cessation of overt hostilities in the Middle East. Let's hope, for the sake of people in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon who are affected by this conflict, as well as Australians, that that holds. That's a bit of context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a really important bill. I think it goes to that first part of the success ingredient for a multicultural society—that we need to constantly review and, where necessary, strengthen the legal foundations and the protections for Australians whatever their background. To me, the great promise of Australian multiculturalism is that great Australian promise of a fair go —that everyone gets a chance to fulfil their human potential and live their life in our country free from discrimination no matter their faith, their ethnicity, their circumstances, how long they've been here or their identity. That's what this bill is about—protecting Australians. I commend it to the House, and I hope, as the ASIO boss said, we can lower the temperature.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I remember where I was on 7 October when the news came in of the potential terrorist attacks in Israel. No-one really had any sense of what was going on at the time; no-one understood the scale. It was only as the hours unfolded that we started to understand exactly what had happened. I don't want to focus this speech on the Middle East, but I do think it's important to start there because that was the turning point of things changing here in Australia. I do think that was a turning point where tensions were heightened in Australia and where people started to judge each other and to turn on each other based on what their views were on this particular conflict. I think that we didn't see the human sides of each other and that we took sides against each other. We saw it on our streets. We saw it in the heightened sense of conflict and the heightened sense of division within Australian society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what we have seen not only in Australia but in other Western countries around the world is that, as a repercussion of those tensions and of those legitimate anxieties people are feeling being played out in illegitimate ways, the Jewish community of Australia has been the target of a rise in antisemitism that has frankly rocked my community to its core. It has rocked the Jewish people of Australia to their core. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This country is a country that has built so much confidence, prosperity, freedom and opportunity and has enabled people to contribute to this wonderful country of ours. But it is not possible to do that when there is vilification. It is not possible to do that when there is hate. It is not possible to do that when people are afraid in the ways I have seen of late. We need to fix this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in the other chamber that we need to fix this, and this bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024, is an important step forward in saying what is acceptable by law in this country and what is not. As it stands, this bill is an important step forward that says: 'If you want to create violence and attack someone on the basis of a component of their identity, that is against the law. That will be against the law, and there will be a criminal penalty that will be attached to that act.' That does not exist in Australia right now—that, if you want to incite violence against particular groups, you could be charged by the police and put in prison. Right now, a lot of the potential harm that is done is done under civil legislation. This is a significant step forward towards criminal penalties. I understand there are discussions going on across the parliament around the final formation of this bill. I would make the point that, with this bill, we want to make sure we are doing a couple of things. One is that whatever we agree to as a parliament, it sticks—that the legislation is not one that is repealed from government to government but that all sides of politics are committed to upholding a standard of stamping out hatred and division in our society, together for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want this to be a political contest. I know the Attorney-General is leading those negotiations at this current moment with the coalition and with the crossbench. I want to also mention the member for Wentworth, who has put forward an amendment that I think is absolutely worthy of consideration. I understand these are complicated negotiations and that there are a range of considerations that we do and do not have control over as backbenchers in the parliament, but I wanted to put it on record that I know the member for Wentworth has witnessed the community that she is the representative of—and the community that is the sister community to mine—go under such intolerable pain and hurt and fear. She has come to this place with a suggestion around how to ensure we lift the standards of how we talk to each other and how we show the standards of hate, discrimination and vilification are removed. Whether we end up supporting that amendment or not will be a collective decision, but, personally, I wanted to say that—though I will accept the collective decision of the government—here and now, I think the amendments moved by the member for Wentworth show a real dedication to representing her community. It is what her community wants, and they can rightly be grateful for her efforts in this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish we weren't here, in this place, talking about vilification and hate speech. I can't even begin to tell you that that is the last thing I wanted to do when coming into this place. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to my community. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to the people who have seen the most unimaginable pain over the last 15 months. But when I came into this place, I had visions on policies around housing, climate change and energy. I want to see mental health support for people in this country improved. They are the passions that I have, as well as ensuring that opportunity is spread across this country for migrant families just like mine who came to this country. It wasn't to be facing the rise in antisemitism like we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also make this point—and I know this has been a point of great contention and sadness and frustration for some people—vilification is not a competition. Hatred is not a competition. If there's any form of hatred, we all lose. I know there are people who will be protected by this legislation who have not had as much media attention but still are extremely fearful at the moment, including the LGBTIQ community. I've spoken to the Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia, and he has spoken to me and advised me about the sort of work he's doing to try and support his community as well. I think that is an important objective. I fully support that as well. It is not a competition, and we want to stamp out all forms of hate. But that's not why I came to this place. I want to see Australia restored, so we're not talking about the division in our society, and we're not talking about how people are being targeted—we're certainly not talking about childcare services being burnt down. We're not talking about schools being spray-painted with graffiti. We're not talking about cars and caravans being found with explosives in them. We're not talking about synagogues in my electorate being burnt down. We're not talking about my electorate office being targeted and my staff's place of work being completely smashed in, vandalised and made uninhabitable for months. I don't want to be talking about any of that. I want us to come into this place and show unity and resolve so that we in this country target the acts of hate and violence, stamp it out, set the standards of what is and isn't acceptable in this country and show that Australia is a united force and is not going to accept what is going on in our streets right now because that's what this ultimately is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen throughout history these dark corners of the community come into the mainstream. Antisemitism has existed in Australia since its inception, since there were Jews here. Antisemitism has existed in golf clubs, in theatres and in a range of institutions where Jews were excluded from even participating. The whole reason the Cranbourne Golf Club was set up was because Jewish people in Melbourne were not allowed to join Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Thankfully, that's changed. I'm not a member of Royal Melbourne and not a good enough golfer to ever expect to be one, but the point is that throughout the history of the Jewish community post Holocaust, there have been places where the Jewish community has not been able to fully participate. But on the whole Jews have been safe in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what we have seen since 7 October 2023 is a rise in community anger and in community dissent and division, which has created a perfect cover and smokescreen for the sorts of people who want to see antisemitism brought to the mainstream. We have seen neo-Nazis marching in the middle of Melbourne, marching in South Australia and marching on the streets outside our parliaments. People who are espousing white supremacy are outside our place of proud multicultural democracy. It is an affront to what we are as a country, and we have seen these sorts of hate-fuelled ideologies and inciteful and discriminatory ideas being brought into the mainstream of society before. That is where we are right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question isn't whether or not we stand idly by and what our country does. The question we must confront is: what are we going to do about it? How firmly will we stand together to say this is not going to happen in our name? We cannot stamp this out completely. I wish we could, and we should definitely aim for that, but what we can do is ensure that together, in this place as leaders of our country in this moment, we stand up proudly for what Australia stands for. We are a multicultural country. We are a migrant country. We are a place where we spread opportunity and we spread equality amongst all our citizens equally. We say that everyone is equal before Australian law, that everyone deserves to be in this country free from discrimination and vilification and hatred, that every single person has a right to practice their faith and religion free from persecution and vilification, that every single person has a right to return to their homes safely without it being spray-painted or vilified in the way in which we have seen and that every single Australian has the right to participate fully in Australian life without the fear of being targeted for being who they are. That is the Australia that I signed up to. That is the Australia that gave my family and my grandparents a home after they were kicked out of their previous homes in Europe. That is the Australia that I believe in. That is the Australia that makes me proud to be a representative in this incredible house of democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not one I wanted to ever conceive of, but it is an important step forward to meet this moment and to set the standards of what is and is not acceptable in this country. No person of any race, religion, nationality, national or ethnic origin, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status or disability should feel anything other than equality before the law, and that is what this bill does. If you are going to try to incite hatred and violence against those people, you will be charged and potentially convicted under our criminal law. We might not be able to stamp out every discussion and conversation in this country. We might not be able to restore everything overnight. But what we can say is that, in the mainstream of our society, in the suburbs that we are all proud to represent, we will not tolerate this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I love this country. I love Australia. I love the fact that I am a proud Australian, and I am also a proud Jewish Australian. I'm proud of my community. I understand how much they are hurting right now. I understand that we have not yet confronted this in my lifetime. I understand that people want to see action, and that is exactly what this bill is. I understand that the Jewish community is not asking for special treatment; they are asking for safety. They are asking for the exact same treatment that they used to have and to be the same as every other member of the Australian community. They want to ensure that their kids can go to school, that their littlest kids can go to child care, that they can go to synagogue and that they can worship and practise their faith in exactly the way that they have been doing for hundreds of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a step forward in ensuring that we as a parliament take the clearest of stances, that we respond to the moment, that we respond to the vilification and hate and that we say, 'Not in our name'—that we say, 'Not in Australia's name.' We say that this is not the Australia that we support, that this has no place in Australia and that, in Australia, if you want to incite violence against another group, then you will face the full force of the law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I'm glad to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024 and to follow such a great contribution from my friend the member for Macnamara and, before him, the members for Bruce and Spence. As the member for Macnamara said—I think quite rightly—none of us, as legislators, particularly want to spend time focused on legislation like this, because legislation like this is responding to something that we don't want to see in Australia. We don't want to see division. We don't want to see discrimination and bigotry. And we certainly don't want to see the things that can flow from that way of thinking and that kind of behaviour, which are violence and making people fear violence. That's unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I'd make the point—I think it's an obvious point—that the greatest protection against violence and other hateful conduct that can flow from particular kinds of extreme bigotry and prejudice will not be legislative. The greatest protection will be cultural. The greatest protection is all of us—every member of the community—working all the time to foster, build, maintain and enhance the qualities that have generally prevailed in Australia: tolerance, inclusion, multicultural acceptance and diversity, care for one another and care for broader shared wellbeing. Those cultural elements and values of Australia are the most potent protections against discrimination and bigotry and the things that flow from them. But we nevertheless need protections—legislative and through law enforcement, which is Australia's capacity to follow and enforce those legislative precepts—to guarantee the safety of the community and, in some ways, to reinforce what I said about the importance of culture to set those normative standards. What this bill does is take those standards and that capacity for law enforcement to provide further protection in response to the circumstances that have arisen in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those circumstances have been extremely concerning. As almost everyone who has contributed to this debate has acknowledged, no-one in Australia should face the fear of violence or be on the receiving end of other kinds of hateful conduct because of their race, religion, nationality or national ethnic origin, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status or disability. Nobody should face the most harmful and extreme kinds of discrimination because of their identity, because of who they are. When we see examples of hateful conduct and violence that have antisemitism at their root cause, we should be gravely concerned. Antisemitism is one of the oldest and most harmful kinds of prejudice that human beings have ever fallen prey to. We've seen that in this country and we've seen it more particularly elsewhere, particularly in the 20th century in the form of the Holocaust. We need to be mindful that that kind of discrimination will never entirely disappear, and when it manifests, when it appears, we need to be clear-eyed about it and respond to it. Jewish people in Australia should not feel unsafe or threatened—and nor should anyone—as a result of their membership of a group defined by all those characteristics I just mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are genuine in this place, and if we are genuine in our roles as representatives and, frankly, as community leaders, we have to make sure that our conduct and our words are consistent with what I said about that broader cultural piece when it comes to peacefulness, nonviolence, social inclusion and tolerance. That hasn't always been the case. It concerns me that, when the events on October 7 commenced—the terrible conflict in the Middle East that went on far too long and harmed far too many people unnecessarily—and people stood up and called for restraint, there were other people, including other people in this place, who said that calling for restraint was wrong. As if there can ever be a time when someone speaking up against violence and someone speaking up for a greater and faster move towards a cessation of violence and a return to peacefulness—as if there can ever be a wrong time for that sentiment to be expressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we make these new strengthened arrangements, which are entirely consistent with the approach the government have taken—we have been moving very quickly to provide funding for social cohesion, to make sure that places of worship are properly protected, to create the envoys on antisemitism and Islamophobia, to bring in the legislation that we did earlier in the parliament in relation to hate symbology, which was a first, and now to bring along these further strengthened measures—we should remember that what we are trying to combat in general terms is not new. We should remember that we've seen at various times in Australia's history conduct that is similarly hateful and similarly prejudicial. I think that, as we deal with this particular issue, it pays to reflect on other kinds of discrimination that have been present and continue to be present, and to make sure that we're going to be consistent about those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, in this country in this century, we have seen violence and relatively large-scale social unrest focused on people because of their faith or their national identity; the Cronulla riots in 2005 come to mind. This was an instance where we saw wide-scale violence and wide-scale hateful targeting of people based on the perception that they were from the Middle East or that they might be of the Islamic faith. As far as I can recall—and, if someone has another example, they can make that part of the debate—that would be the most serious kind of prejudicially based violence and civil disorder we've seen in the 21st century. At the time there were people who didn't think that was a particular problem. I think Prime Minister Howard said at the time that he didn't think that there was any reason to be concerned about the racialism and the prejudice that was involved in those terrible events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we bring in an arrangement that will make sure that hatefulness, the advocacy of violence and the threatening of violence through prejudicial hatefulness against people for a range of general characteristics—race, religion, nationality, political opinion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and so on—I think it's worth remembering and having the courage to be honest enough with ourselves to acknowledge that the most harmful form of that in Australia's history is prejudice against First Nations people. There's just no question whatsoever that the history of Australia involves more harm, violence and hateful conduct towards First Nations people than towards any other group. We should be able to be honest about that and apply ourselves to making sure that that kind of prejudice is called out and combatted at every opportunity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support moves to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to combat the most dangerous form of bigotry—bigotry that leads to violence or threats of violence towards people based on their identity—I acknowledge that we should always make these kinds of changes carefully. When responding, as we should, to discrimination and hateful conduct, there will always be a risk that, in seeking to combat a particular problem, we create other issues. It goes to the point that my friend the member for Bruce was making earlier about the balance of things like freedom of speech on the one hand and people's right to live free from fear on the other hand. It's perhaps easy in these circumstances for everyone to lean in to the part of this kind of undertaking that is about stopping kinds of conduct and enabling law enforcement to focus on people who present harm. But I think it's responsible to remember that what is almost always involved in these kinds of measures has the potential to infringe on other freedoms that we regard, rightly, as being very precious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had laws in the past that were, for instance, around the threat of terrorism, and it's quite right that we took those measures. But when we did them, we often said, 'This is starting to move the line when it comes to people's right to have access to legal advice or to not be searched without a warrant,' and a whole range of other things that are core to our civil liberties and core to the basic freedoms that we have in Australia. We should transgress into those areas very, very cautiously and give ourselves the opportunity to look carefully at how they work in operation. We obviously want them to be effective when it comes to combating hatefulness, the risk of violence and the application of that kind of prejudice. But, if we find that there are these other consequences with respect to people's freedoms and civil liberties, we should reflect and make adjustments as appropriate. That's why, often when we've made these changes, there've been aspects that have involved a review. There've been aspects that have given us the chance, as a parliament and as a community, to say, 'Is that, first and foremost, doing the job that we need it to do to protect Australians from hatefulness, violence and prejudice, but, on the other hand, are there aspects of it that are, in an unhelpful way, starting to transgress on other important freedoms and liberties that are core to what it means to be an Australian?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, at a difficult time, when the temperature is high as far as division, a lack of cohesion and a sense that there's this febrile atmosphere that puts people under threat and at risk—particularly, recently, members of the Jewish community but not just members of the Jewish community—it's right that government and parliament take responsible action. As I said, we have done that in a very timely and responsive way at every opportunity over the last 18 months, and we're doing that again now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been people who have been part of this conversation who I think, frankly, at times have not been so much focused on the reality of the problem and the reality of the solution but have, sadly, sought to fan the flames of division, turn up the heat and create a more febrile atmosphere and a sense of argy-bargy, including political argy-bargy, because they think that that suits them. They think it suits them to create that sense of 'us and them', that sense of chaos. I hope that people who have engaged in that or might engage in that in the future reflect carefully because the truth is that, when there is a lot of intemperate, divisive, extreme, aggressive, adversarial language, accusations and behaviour thrown around, it actually produces exactly the kind of thing that we're trying to stop. It's incumbent on everyone who is a representative, a legislator and a leader in the community to practise peacefulness, tolerance, cohesion, engagement and civil respect. The more that we see that, the less we will need these kinds of changes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  In the 1970s and 1980s, great Labor figures like Gough Whitlam, Bill Hayden, Lionel Murphy, Don Dunstan and Susan Ryan led the charge for tolerance and acceptance of people of different genders, sexualities, races and ethnicities. We saw incredible pieces of legislation come in during the Whitlam era and the Hawke era. One of those pieces of legislation, which dates back to 1975, is the Racial Discrimination Act. Section 18C makes it unlawful for someone to do an act that is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate someone because of their race or ethnicity. But, as previous speakers have talked about, there's always a balance, and we've got section 18D of that particular piece of legislation containing exemptions for the protection of freedom of speech. I thought that we'd gone through those kinds of debates in Australia in the last half a decade. There were a lot of debates about the right to be a bigot, so to speak, and I thought we had progressed as a country in a more tolerant, accepting and loving way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my faith tradition as a Christian, the second greatest commandment is to love your neighbour as yourself, and that's a positive thing. It doesn't matter if you're a Catholic, a Protestant or a Pentecostal; it's to love your neighbour as yourself. That kind of provision in Scripture is found in all the major monotheistic religions and so many others. It is incumbent on those of us of faith and of no faith to think about the fact that we have a common humanity. Faith is expressed in many different ways. I'm reading a book at the moment by Peter Ackroyd called <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">English Soul</span>. It's about the growth of the Christian church in the United Kingdom. But what really strikes me in the history is how, in that period of time, we had a greater understanding of tolerance. It wasn't always the case back in the days of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, the Reformation and the like, but I thought we had progressed in Australia. I thought we had got through a lot of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is sad that we've got this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024, before us. I applauded the Attorney-General in 2023 when the government introduced the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023, which passed after some amendments. I was pleased that we made amendments to the Criminal Code. We introduced offences related to displaying or trading in hate symbols such as Nazi symbols. I know the Attorney-General, when introducing this particular bill, talked about that tolerant society to which I referred. He talked about the new and expanded offences introduced in this bill as a response 'to the increasing prevalence of hate speech and hateful conduct in our society', particularly in light of recent global events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Queensland, the Jewish community has made an enormous contribution. It's a lot smaller in Brisbane than it is in Sydney and Melbourne, but its contribution to business, to law, to academia, to sport, to cultural life, to the arts and to community is immense. I'm so proud to have stood on numerous occasions with the Jewish community in Queensland to oppose intolerance and antisemitism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that we have before the chamber today is an unfortunate necessity. There is always a balance between prescriptive conduct, proscribing conduct and freedom of speech. Before I talk specifically on this particular bill, I remember an unforgettable experience I had some years ago. My family came to Australia in the 1880s from Germany with the surname Neumann. They came here fleeing persecution. They were poor. They were religious. They were a minority. They came here and settled in Ipswich, in the Lockyer Valley. That's on my dad's side. My mother's side came from poor people who were virtually Levellers, as they used to call them, in England and from the McLeods in the highlands of Scotland. They were persecuted people. I thought my generation would never see this sort of persecution of other people. I never thought we would. I never thought it would happen. My ancestors made lives for themselves, they did okay and they prospered. One of their descendants is even a federal MP!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I remember being in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, in the Holocaust museum, some years ago. I happened to be in a party and I was separated from them. I was there with my German surname, there by myself really, when I wandered into a group of Israeli conscripts. All these people were young enough to be my children. There they were, being taught about the historical experience of the Holocaust and what they had gone through. For them it was a real life-living experience. For me it was a shock. And it's one of those experiences I'll never forget because I thought, if my ancestors had not come from various parts of Prussia and Berlin and Hamburg and the like, where would I have been? What would have happened? Would I have been caught up in that conflict with my parents and my grandparents? It was a really pivotal moment in my personal and political and even spiritual experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must never, ever forget the Holocaust. We must never, ever forget the six million Jewish people who were slaughtered by the Nazis. And there were other minority groups as well—Gypsies, homosexuals and so many other groups. And let's not forget all those people who bravely stood up against militarism, against fascism and, of course, against Nazism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember being in Trafalgar Square as part of a parliamentary delegation to London last year. There were huge demonstrations outside of where we were staying. I remember seeing Nazi symbols amongst so many of the demonstrators. I remember seeing them and being shocked that antisemitism was there on display—shocked! We have seen those types of Nazi symbols and that type of antisemitism expressed not just overseas in the United Kingdom and other countries like ours but also in our universities, schools and workplaces, on the sporting field and elsewhere. These are places where people, because of their Jewish faith, background and belief system, have been persecuted, abused and the recipients of violence—all because of their faith and ethnicity. It is a disgrace and abhorrence that Australia in the 21st century should have this occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just terrible—and I use the word terrible in inverted commas—that we must do this legislation, but we need to set very firm guidelines. Legislative changes are not just to be implemented; they have a moral force and efficacy like that legislation I talked about—the Racial Discrimination Act—and those giants of the Labor movement I referred to before. This legislation is a statement about what we believe and what we will not accept in this country against any group, Jewish or otherwise. So I want to express my fulsome support for the legislation and go on record to say exactly what this legislation will do in the remaining five minutes of my speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates a new criminal offence or offences, strengthening the Criminal Code—which already has some things in there—and extending specific protections to persons who are targeted due to their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, disability, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion. These are called protective attributes in the legislation. The bill also goes on to strengthen existing offences for urging the use of force, and it takes away that, can I say, intentionality, and brings in an offence of recklessness with respect to the criminal activity. What I mean by that is it provides for an offence that is committed where a person is reckless as to whether the violence urged will occur, lowered from the existing requirement that the person intended for the violence urged to occur. It removes the application of the defence of good faith—how can defence of good faith be there when you're actually urging violence? It extends protections to persons distinguished by sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status or disability, and this is in addition to those protected attributes I referred to before. It creates a new criminal offence for threatening the use of force or violence against a group or a member of a group distinguished by protected attributes. It also amends the existing offences for the public display of prohibited hate symbols in the Criminal Code, which I referred to earlier, and the provisions make it an offence to publicly display prohibitive hate symbols or make the Nazi gesture in public, including where the display of the symbol or use of the gesture is likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a member of a group distinguished by protected attributes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that members of the Jewish community and, indeed, members of other communities living in the Middle East including people who are Palestinian and people of an Arab background should not be discriminated against and have violence inflicted on them on the basis of their faith, whether they're Christian or Islamic or Jewish or any faith whatsoever. That is intolerable and unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation here makes a difference. It shows what we believe as parliamentarians and as a parliament. I hope it is passed in a bipartisan way and the crossbench fully support it. I hope it gets through, because it will say something. It's not just a legislative change; it will have that moral force behind it. We cannot allow people to claim not just that they're bigots—the so-called right to be a bigot—but that they have a right to perpetrate and perpetuate hate in our community and express that in a violent way on schools and synagogues, on mosques and temples or on churches and other places of faith just because they disagree with those persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest men in history is Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who stood up against Nazism. He went back to America, then from America back to Germany. He could have stayed in academia and pastoral care, but he went back to Germany to stand up for his faith, and he died near the end of World War II as a symbol of what it means to be a true Christian: a man of peace, a man of tolerance, a man of charity, a man of love. Dietrich Bonhoeffer stood against this kind of intolerance because, as he said on numerous occasions: 'If they come first for the Jewish community, they'll come for then the Christians. And they'll come then for the trade unions and the politicians.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the German parliament, you will see in the German parliament a book. If you open that book—and on the wall are bullet holes from the Russian bullets—there are the names of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, politicians all who died at the hands of the Nazis. They were either killed or put in gulags—concentration camps—and killed within the first few years of Hitler's abolishment of their parliament. The Christian Democrats are the equivalent of the LNP. The Social Democrats are the equivalent of the Labor Party.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not some academic exercise. This is about standing against extremism in any form of all, and a demonstration that legislation can be passed not just to say, 'We're going to protect our community,' but to show that the opposite of hate is love and that we should love one another as our faith demands—whether we're Christians, Jewish, or Islamic. I commend this legislation to the chamber. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:32</span>):  Right at this moment, in summing up, I thank everybody who has contributed to the debate. I should also thank all the officials and the clerks and the people at the Table Office at this time of night. The circulating of amendments means there are people working very hard and making sure that, procedurally, everything is ready to go. I thank them for that, and I will effectively continue my summing-up speech until that process has concluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up, let me say, first of all, that this legislation will represent the toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes. We're doing that at a time when Australia needs the toughest laws it has ever had against hate crimes. What the parliament's doing in dealing with this legislation is acknowledging that a crime—for example, a crime against property—is already criminal. It should be criminal. People should be caught and they should be punished when they engage in that sort of crime. But when the crime against property, at the same time, is designed in a way to cause fear and intimidation, and to be inspired by hatred of a group of Australians based on their race, their faith, their disability or who they love, then there is an extra layer of offence that the Australian people have. The most high-profile of these crimes—the people who are members of these different groups—have all experienced this form of hate finding its way into violence for most of their lives. One of the saddest things is that while the people most affected by these hate crimes are distressed, they are often not surprised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the publicity that we have seen of late has been about crimes relating to antisemitism—a form of bigotry that is as ancient as it is vile. In bringing forward this legislation, the intention of the government is to see this go through both houses of parliament not with a small majority but with as many members of parliament coming together as possible in a show of unity to the Australian people that these hate crimes, these forms of bigotry, have no place in Australia at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about politics. This is about whether the Australian parliament believes it's acceptable to advocate for, threaten or commit violence against another person because of who they are, who they pray to or who they love. The Albanese government have been steadfast in our condemnation of antisemitism, and we've been taking meaningful action. We've criminalised the public display of Nazi symbols and the Nazi salute and banned trading in Nazi items. We've appointed the first Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism in Australia. We've established Special Operation Avalite as a joint agency between the AFP and ASIO to investigate and deliver high-impact disruptions and prosecutions and committed more than $57 million to improve safety and security at Jewish schools and synagogues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people might be aware that my part of Sydney, the area which I represent here, probably has the highest level of religious observance in Australia. That's the nature of my part of Sydney. In my area, there are very few people who are Jewish. The engagement I've had with the Jewish community, in particular the members of the Adass Israel synagogue, has been particularly moving. The community welcomed me from the moment I first turned up at the synagogue. The leadership has been phenomenal. Their sense of hope and generosity in the face of the hatred that they saw there can only inspire us to see the best of the Australian spirit. It's a reminder of how their resilience represents the best of our country and how the way that the thugs who tried to destroy a place of worship represent views and attitudes that have no place in Australia at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget that, following my first visit there only a few days later, it was mentioned to me, as it had been mentioned to the Prime Minister earlier that same day, that the rabbi's visa was soon to expire. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—the shadow portfolio that the member opposite once held, although when he held it, I'd held it before that as well—I took the strongest action that a minister for immigration can take in this country—that is, when someone has been told they don't belong, you respond loudly by making them a permanent resident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To do that for the rabbi and all his family—we couldn't be in the same room at the time; I was interstate. I'd been at the synagogue earlier that week. I've visited the synagogue again since. When we were there on our phones as he and his family became permanent residents, he was presenting each of them to me in front of the phone camera and they were waving. He made comment after comment about how much he loved Australia. He made comment after comment of praise for our country. It was a pretty rare privilege. I've known members of the Jewish community all my life, but it's a community on my electoral roll that I don't engage with often as a local member of parliament. I always have through various portfolios, obviously. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said to him: 'I know earlier this week, some people tried to tell you don't belong. Today, Australia says to you, "Welcome home."' It was an important moment and a moment that I'm very proud that the Albanese government was able to provide, sending that message that the thugs who wanted to tell that community they didn't belong were the ones who don't belong. It was the thugs who don't match the values of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill today is not exclusively about protecting one part of our community from hate. I've dealt, as other people have in their contributions at length—looking at the clock, more than half my speech—specifically with the evil of antisemitism. But this bill is not exclusively about protecting just one part of our community from hate. For too long, people have been the subject of abuse because of who they are, making them fearful to engage in so many aspects of life that we take for granted. Society has been robbed of their diversity when that happens. This bill will protect all Australians, regardless of their race, ethnicity, faith, gender, who they love and whether they live with a disability. Government and laws alone can't change behaviour. The Director-General of Security reminded us recently that words matter. Words really matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember, for 10 years, running a series of protests to make sure that our hate speech laws in this country were not weakened. Walking through the streets of Lakemba, side by side with imams, priests, rabbis and various other religious leaders—all walking together—in a walk that had a simple title, the Walk for Respect, because it should be as simple as that. People there were protesting against hate speech and protesting against the violence that can flow from hate speech. I had the privilege of organising the Walk of Respect, and the protestors who came—thousands of them turned up—were in a different situation to me, even though we walked together. I'll go the whole of my life in Australia without ever receiving hate speech because of who I am—because of my faith or ethnicity. That was not historically always the case for Irish Catholics in this country, but it's been a few generations since any of that sectarianism prejudice seriously got in the way of someone's life. It's not something that will affect me. It's not a form of bigotry that I'll receive. If I receive hate speech in the street, it'll be because of someone's view of what I've done, not because of someone's view of who I am.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In commending this bill to the parliament, I want to repeat the words that have been used by Australia's Attorney-General, words that have been said by the Prime Minister and words that I would say to any Australian who receives hate speech because of who they are or because of their faith: 'You have a right to feel safe in the community. You have a right to feel safe in Australia.' Anybody who says that hate speech is somehow a subset of freedom of speech doesn't understand that words can be bullets. They don't understand the direct line between some of the hate speech that has been levelled at different points to different parts of the community, and the violence that has followed. Australia is a better place when people are simply able to be themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the debate will focus, I suspect, on penalties and on a series of amendments to potentially adjust the bill in various ways—the focus of the debate often just goes to those amendments and adjustments. Let's not lose sight of the fact that we, as a parliament, are on the precipice now of putting in place the toughest laws against hate speech that Australia has ever had. That's the moment that's before us. As a government, we want, on that journey, to know that the law itself isn't the end point, because the end point isn't just 'Can you catch someone? Can you lock them up?' We want to be able to do that, but the end point that we're actually striving for here is that we want people to be safe. The end point we're striving for here is for people to be able to get on with their lives here in Australia without being subjected to this. That's the end point that we all seek. The government believes that part of being able to get there is being able to send that message to all Australians, a message which is not only an enforcement message but also a goodwill message. It is best sent by us trying to secure the largest possible majority of members of parliament who are able to stand together and send a message to the nation that these forms of hatred are not who we are. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

We've all been shocked by what we've seen at the Adass Israel Synagogue, in Melbourne, most horrendously. We were shocked by the hate-filled words that we heard at the Sydney Opera House on that 9 October night of infamy; the graffiti attacks on Jewish buildings such as synagogues, including the Southern Sydney Synagogue, in Allawah, which is quite close to my electorate; the attacks on childcare centres; and, most gravely concerning of all, the recent discovery of explosives in Sydney with addresses of Jewish targets—absolutely appalling. All Australians should be shocked and are shocked by this unprecedented display of hatred towards Jewish Australians. It is utterly unacceptable in our community.</span>

For this evening's debate I highlight the amendments that we have moved, which focus on offences for advocating force or violence through causing damage to property. It's obviously an extremely serious thing to advocate force or violence in such a way. Our amendments would make various offences for intentionally advocating for another person or group to use force or violence against a targeted group or for being reckless in relation to the targeting of a group for violence through damage to property. Our second amendment calls for imprisonment of up to seven years in these circumstances.</span>

The Greens made it clear to the government over a number of days, and again this evening in the chamber, that we support the bill and we believe the bill essentially could be passed unamended. The bill struck the right balance without the need for further amendments. We do need to take action against hate crimes to protect a broad range of groups, and the provisions in the bill have been through an extensive Senate inquiry process to ensure the balance was right. Whenever one is amending a section of criminal law, potentially amending criminal law, you need to make sure you get the balance right—that is, you protect people but you also protect the rule of law.</span>

The bill could have got through the parliament unamended. Now amendments have been circulated that we've had less than five minutes to look at.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition had previously circulated an amendment that, on our reading of it, we were disposed to support because it was about protecting places of worship. This new amendment from the opposition seems materially different to what had been previously proposed. It involves prison sentences and the chamber is given five minutes to consider it. In the time we've had available we just don't know if this is an amendment that's worth supporting or not. It does appear, from what the government has said, that a deal has been reached between the government and the opposition to support a number of last-minute amendments to this bill that, I repeat, had enough support to get through parliament already because it was a good bill that struck the right balance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Five minutes notice and the merest of speeches that don't go beyond a couple of minutes to speak to a new amendment that people have not seen is not the way this parliament should be legislating about such a serious matter, especially when, I repeat, the bill was in a position to pass without amendments. Accordingly, I will be asking that this question be recorded as being unresolved. Given the amount of notice we've had we're just not in a position at the moment to determine whether or not these are amendments that are worth supporting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) on sheet AA101 is something that, looking around the room, I know will not have the agreement of everybody in here at the moment. This amendment does a number of things—two in particular. Firstly, it puts in place some mandatory minima for sentences contained within the bill itself, Secondly, it puts in a two-year review period for those changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make clear that this amendment is part of the principle that I explained a few moments ago, where I said that the government is determined to be able to see this legislation passed with the largest majority possible to be able to send the strongest message possible to the Australian people. This does not change the fact that the government—myself included—previously, for a long time, has expressed concern about the efficacy of mandatory sentencing. The concern is that it can in some situations potentially result in people not being found guilty when they should be, can potentially take away an incentive for people to cooperate by pleading guilty, and can take away an incentive for some people to inform on their co-accused. It's for that reason that we have put in place the two-year review period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make the priority from the government clear here, because sometimes the mandatory sentencing debate goes back and forth as to who's more tough and who's not tough. That's not the argument here. The argument here is about making sure we have a process that will work. The last thing I think any member of this parliament wants is to end up in a situation where fewer people who should go to jail go to jail or where some people don't end up informing on their co-accused. That's not something we want. For that reason, the review period will, after two years, give the parliament the opportunity to say: 'Did this work?' or, 'What difference did this make?' It gives us the opportunity to be able proceed with this legislation now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be in no doubt: delay on this legislation does come at a cost. This legislation deals with crimes that are happening in real time. We're seeing them on our TV screens. We want this bill to go through quickly; we want to maximise cooperation across the parliament; we want the most significant majority that we can have; and ultimately, as well as sending the positive message to the community, we want to make sure that people who commit these hate crimes are caught, charged, convicted and imprisoned.</span>

Firstly, the two sheet of amendments, I think, were only just made available in the chamber. The minister says that some are uncontroversial amendments and others are likely to be controversial. Had that been made clear before and had we had more than a few minutes notice of this, a different position might have been taken about moving all of these amendments together. It's disappointing that, amongst all the rhetoric about wanting cooperation across the chamber, these have been sprung on us, and people have not been given an opportunity to consider, and potentially even support, some of these amendments. If the intention really were to get the largest majority then I think—</span>

I genuinely do. Hopefully, we'll be in a position to, and have enough time to, consider these overnight. We've certainly made the point today in our contributions that a number of amendments that have arisen out of the Senate inquiry are amendments that, in principle, we support. Because these have only been made available in the chamber now, we want to test that that's what they are, and so, again, I would ask that the question be recorded as being unresolved on this. I do appreciate what the minister has done, and, in the same spirit, we do want to see amendments that reflect the Senate report getting passed.</span>

I note that, according to the footer of this document, this amendment was prepared at 11.31 this morning and involves a massive change to the Labor Party platform and to the laws of this country because it introduces, in its own words, 'mandatory minimum sentences'. Despite it obviously being prepared this morning, it's been given to this chamber with a couple of minutes notice, and we're being asked to vote on something when, as I sat here and listened to a lot of the debate in this chamber, I heard government member after government member stand up and say they oppose mandatory minimum sentencing. Anyone observing this debate could not have anticipated that an amendment like this would be lobbed on us with next to no time to consider it, and yet here we are with a very significant change to the criminal laws in this country that deviates from the Labor Party platform, and we're being asked to vote on it now. That is not the way that this parliament should operate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have very real concerns with mandatory minimum sentencing. This was not something that was subject to the Senate inquiry; this is something that is a clear deviation from principles that this government had said it espoused. And what's more is it's utterly unnecessary. This bill could go through unamended. It strikes the right balance. The government brought this bill to this parliament and considered that they got the balance right, and we agreed with them. Now we're seeing substantial amendments being put forward at the last minute just because the opposition has asked for them, when the bill could've got through anyway. Given the significance of this, the lateness of the hour and the fact we haven't had have notice, I also ask that this question be recorded as unresolved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud of the diversity of my community in Wentworth. We are an electorate that values tolerance above all, acknowledging that Australia's diversity is our greatest strength. But in recent weeks and months my community's sense of safety and security has been very much undermined. This has been an absolutely terrible time for the Jewish community. That is why I'm standing here today in the chamber. I support the Criminal Code Amendment (Hate Crimes) Bill 2024. I've been very clear from the start that I support this bill, and frankly I've been pushing for this bill to come before the House since last year. But I believe that this bill does not go far enough, and that is why I have moved these amendments. Let me tell you why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start with the Jewish community. I will talk about other communities, but let me start with the Jewish community. Since 7 October, my Jewish community has been subject to horrendous antisemitism. There's always been antisemitism. It was a concern of mine before 7 October, but since that date it has been absolutely horrendous. Some of the antisemitism they have most feared is the expression of hate by some preachers. Some are preaching hate against the Jews. Something that has struck fear into my community is that some people have preached online sermons which literally have called for the final solution on the Jews. We all know what 'the final solution' stands for. It refers to Hitler's final solution on the Jews. This happened in this country, and my community, rightly, came to me and said: 'What is happening in this country? Why is this possible? Surely, this is illegal?' The truth is it isn't. We've also had people who, in similar sermons, have called Jews as a whole 'bloodthirsty' and 'criminals'. These sorts of expressions are so incendiary and so undermining of a sense of safety. This was not long after 7 October, in the early days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, we have all seen on the news—and I have lived through it in my community—the devastation of antisemitism. We've seen the former houses of members of the Jewish community sprayed and the cars in front of them burned. There is intentional intimidation of my community at childcare centres, at schools. There was an arson attack on a synagogue. This is what is happening to my Jewish community, but it did start, and it has always started, with words. My concern, despite the laudable aims of this legislation, is that it has not got to the starting point, which is the words. As Mike Burgess from ASIO said, words matter. Yesterday I was very proud that the whole of the parliament united against antisemitism, because our words matter. But our actions also matter. We as legislators have the opportunity to do something about this, to make sure those words, those most incendiary words, have a brake and have guardrails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really disappointed that the government, as I understand it, considered hate speech in its initial drafting of the bill but then removed it later. That is why I have introduced these amendments. I know there have been a lot of discussions on free speech. These amendments are based on existing laws in WA. To those who have really legitimate concerns about restrictions on free speech: WA has had this legislation for 21 years. It has not been used to quell free speech. What it has been used to do is to quell hate speech—speech that is deliberately and intentionally there to promote hatred in our community. In one of the most diverse countries on earth—and, I believe, one of the most successfully diverse countries on earth—we do need to have guardrails on people who are deliberately promoting hate and division.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have put forward these amendments. The government have told me they're not going to support them. I find that really disappointing. I've not yet had an indication from the coalition as to whether they will support them. My view, honestly? I can see that the major parties are working together on this legislation. My feeling is that, had the coalition decided to support these amendments, the government would have supported them, or vice versa—it would have happened. The message I get from my community, time and time again, is: 'Words are great. I want action.' They wanted action in this legislation, it had the support of ECAJ, and I am desperately sad that this has not happened. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken a lot about the Jewish community, and that is because my Jewish community is, as I said, living through the worst antisemitism this country has ever seen. I can't tell you exactly how the community feels about this, but it is extremely devastating for people. The second community that this legislation is very important to is the LGBTQIA+ community, which happens to be another really important part of my community. I'm not trying to compare what the Jewish community is going through because of antisemitism, but for the LGBTQIA+ community, similarly, there has been a long and insidious campaign against its members over many years. There have been many hate crimes against the LGBTQIA+ community, including crimes of murder and actual police cover-ups, because of hatred for the LGBTQIA+ community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these people are a really important and valued part of not just my community but the Australian community. When I say that words matter when it comes to hatred against religious groups, words also matter when it comes to hatred against groups of different sexuality and gender, and we have seen this. When Neo-Nazis can stand in the streets of Melbourne and hold up a sign saying, 'Destroy paedo freaks,' at an anti- LGBTQIA+ rally, we as a country need to have some sense of whether that's okay, and, if we don't think it's okay, what we are going to do about it. The government and the parliament at this stage have said: 'Do you know what? We may not like it but we think it's okay.' I think we can do better on this. The point is that words matter. The fact is that people do this deliberately to try to increase hatred towards a group in our country—that is what they are doing; they're promoting hatred against a part of our community—and we say, 'We won't put guardrails on this unless we can show that there's a direct pathway to violence.' The point is that we know the words start and the violence follows. And it's not always within days or weeks. With the antisemitism we are seeing in the country right now, it has taken almost a year for that antisemitism to go from words to particularly violent actions. So for the LGBTQIA+ community this is also really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had other communities reach out to me since I've been speaking up on the issue to say that it's not just the Jewish community and not just the LGBTQIA+ community but many communities in this country who are targeted on the basis of their race, religion or sexuality. This is happening in this country. There are people who are trying to promote hatred and division in our country, and I think we need to have guardrails around it if that is their intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's really where I'm at. I've put forward these amendments in very good faith and I appreciate the conversation that we have had around this, but I'm extremely disappointed to get the feedback on it. I think both the major parties have spoken very sincerely about wanting to fight antisemitism, but my challenge to both of them is: where is the leadership at this point to actually do something about it? We'll probably see changes in the law in New South Wales, we're potentially seeing changes in the laws in Victoria and we already have these laws in WA. We could have set the direction at a national level and said, 'This is one country, and we do not want to see this hate speech across any part of our country.' We can come up with the appropriate guardrails, and we have failed to do that. I think that is extremely disappointing to key parts of my community, and it's disappointing to me because I believe this parliament can do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever happens after this, this is something I will continue to speak up on because we as a parliament need to speak up on this and need to make sure we back up this strong rhetoric which has come from all the leaders in the parliament with actual action.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:15</span>):  First of all, I thank the member for Wentworth for bringing this forward, for her advocacy—including the public advocacy—and for the occasion where I met with one of the examples of an antisemitic attack that the member referred to; I met with the member for Wentworth at that site with a local rabbi and the member for Kingsford Smith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just normal streets that should be homes. In saying this, as has already been made clear and as I said privately to the member a little while ago, the government won't be supporting these amendments. In the first instance, on the concept of 'should we be involved in action', this bill is serious action. This bill is still the strongest laws Australia has ever had in dealing with hate speech. These are the strongest laws Australia has ever had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I will add is I am glad we are now in a different debate about how we should improve our protections for people who are the targets of bigotry. For nine years the argument from the government of the day was whether or not we should in fact be weakening our protections. We were told that that was in the name of freedom of speech and we were told that the right that mattered was the right to be a bigot. I'm glad we are in a different debate. To move from a situation where hate speech is dealt with through a civil process to one where it is dealt with by a criminal process is a really big step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has two views. One is that we are wanting this bill to go through with the maximum majority possible. I would add to that that we want to make sure everything is fully thought through, particularly a step shifting from having a debate for some time about where the civil lines should be to stepping into the criminal area—and, for some categories, in a way that has not even been covered in the civil process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member in one final part. While I say thank you, I get the disappointment in the actual position; I'm not pretending otherwise. These amendments, when they deal with categories of hatred, deal with all categories. Just as in my speech earlier I spoke about a community that is not in large numbers in my part of Sydney, the categories that the member has referred to include some people who are well and truly covered in my part of Sydney but not hers; I just wanted to pay some respect to that. I'll give the simplest example from my part of Sydney. If a woman catches the train from Punchbowl into the city, by the time she comes home she probably will have received abuse, but it is unlikely to have been racial abuse; it will have been abuse for her faith. We have moved the debate, as this bill already has—although the member for Wentworth is proposing taking it one step further—from the right to be a bigot to how we can improve the protections. That is the right debate for this parliament to have. It is a fundamental change from where we've been at for a decade. We need to be really careful whenever we decide the criminal law is the answer for new offences. What the bill has put forward is something where I have no doubt we are taking the right step. I do believe we're not in a position right now to be able to take the step that the member for Wentworth has advocated, so the government—certainly at the moment—is not in a position to support the amendment.</span>

Someone was convicted by a jury and jailed for three years for hate speech. It was an antisemitic attack. But the law has also been tested in the other way in the sense that, when there was a mildly offensive remark, it wasn't invoked. So I think that the law shows that it's possible to walk an appropriate line, and that is part of why I feel such disappointment. There are precedents here that the country could have moved on that it hasn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments make one further amendment to the list of targeted groups in this bill by removing the outdated term 'intersex status' and replacing it with 'sex characteristics,' as requested by Equality Australia in their submission. The Senate inquiry acknowledged this is a reasonable change to the law, including it as recommendation 4. This terminology is consistent with the national trend towards the choice of language, which better represents and reflects the preferences of this community. We're not the first movers to have done this; in fact, the Senate inquiry notes several states and territories have already pivoted to this term in recognition of the international human rights recommendations. So I urge the government, the opposition and the crossbench to support these amendments on the basis that this is requested by the community and there are significant precedents in the law across the land.</span>

I will simply provide the House with what I've been advised. First of all, when the current terminology was put into the act, at that point, it was welcomed, and the terminology has moved on since. There are a large number of acts, as I understand it, which interact, where, if the terminology were to be changed, it would need to be done together. There was one other occasion in this term when it was sought to be changed in one act, and the advice at the time was not an in-principle objection to the change; it was simply that to do it one bill at a time could in fact take people's rights away, because of the way some of these bills interact. So I don't want the government's opposition to this to be taken as an in-principle opposition in any way, shape or form, but I've been advised that there is a practical problem in doing it this way.</span>

These new amendments have been circulated with limited time and with no consultation with us, so we're not in a position now to advise whether or not we support these amendments. Certainly, as I said, the previous ones that were moved were ones that we were inclined to support, but I just don't know whether these ones are different. So, on that basis, we'll be calling for the question to be unresolved.</span>
