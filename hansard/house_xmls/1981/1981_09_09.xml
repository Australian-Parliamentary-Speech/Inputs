      </para>

       We the undersigned are concerned that the closure of CYSS Projects may lead young unemployed to become involved in anti-social behaviour such as crime, vandalism, prostitution, rebellious behaviour and mob action. There is the even more frightening prospect that many more young people will give up hope of obtaining a job, become idle and even contemplate suicide.

       Trans Australia Airlines
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Liberal party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sale of Trans Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) higher domestic air fares.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans Australia Airlines.

      <para>

       Plant Variety Rights

      </para>
      <para>
       1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.

      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.

       Tertiary Education
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a ''poor risk'' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance.
      </para>
      <para>

       Privacy and Personal Information

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that 'between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent.'
      </para>
      <para>
       It is your petitioners' sincere belief that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) An adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) As a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) A parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray:

      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1971 would force many currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing and able at present to undertake post-secondary study from doing so.
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       3. The wastage of the Federal Government funds perpetuating large bureaucratic institutions and organisations where there are often few disabled people on their boards and little emphasis is placed on consumer participation in decision making.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The failure of the Federal Government to encourage independence of disabled people, or to develop 'normalised' support systems-attendant care.
      </para>

       5. The failure of the Federal Government to provide 'noninstitutionalised' specialised accommodation for those people who would not be able to benefit from, or cope with attendant care.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. Failure by the Federal Government to alter, or create a 'disability' allowance means test free for all disabled people-this would assist with necessary equipment and mobility costs.

       7. Failure to provide a national compensation scheme thus saving time and enabling people to be automatically covered in the event of a disability.

       8. Failure by the Federal Government to abolish tariffs on all equipment available to the disabled-e.g. Optacon.

       9. Mismanagement of Federal I.Y.D.P. Funds-e.g. non-receipt by some States of funds through unresolved negotiations.
      </para>

       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that immediate action be taken to remedy the above stated and that the Federal Government recognise that disabled people are citizens who should have equal rights.

       Aboriginal Land Rights
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1978 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.

       Australia increase diplomatic contacts with countries with whom we have differences, not reduce negotiations.

      <para>
       At least as much time, thought, and money be available to find such mediators as Australia now spends to plan military defence and forge military alliances, and to appoint conciliators and arbitrators whenever our international negotiations falter or break down.
      </para>
      <para>
       Experts of departments, faculties and institutes for peace studies have equal facilities and status with military experts in international negotiations of our country, especially for disarmament talks or military pacts, and such studies have more government support.
      </para>
      <para>
       The United Nations organisation develop into a body or bodies more democratically chosen by more enlightened people of all nations, with powers given to it by member nations to improve international law between consenting members, to provide adequate extension of the personnel, functions and facilities of the International Court of Justice to satisfy those countries which agree to abide by such courts' decisions on matters in dispute between those countries, with the powers and right to arrest, try, sentence and enforce penalties upon individuals in those countries who breach such laws, and the right to raise revenues from licensing and controlling of international activities of types agreed between the nations concerned.

       Staging of American B52 Bombers

       Impedes the sovereignty of the Australian nation in that Australian citizens would have neither control nor knowledge of whether B52's:

      <para>
       (b) Were engaged in bombing missions against another State.
      </para>
      <para>
       Violates the Australian people's independence and links this nation irreconcilably with United States foreign policies thereby destroying the potential for independent Australian defence policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Violates democratic procedures in committing the Australian nation to participation in future wars without due consultation and informed assessment by Australian citizens and further increases the militarisation of the Indian Ocean thereby increasing the likelihood of super power conflict in this region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Jeopardises the welfare of the Citizens of Darwin, in that noise pollution and the threat of accidental radioactive fallout will increase substantially to the residents.
      </para>
      <para>
       Negates the potential of the Australian nation to establish itself as a nation of Peace in the Pacific region and violates Australia's commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

       Your Petitioners therefore pray that the Members of the House of Representatives will ensure that the Prime Minister withdraw the offer of Darwin, or any other location in Australia, as a base or depot for American B52 bombers. And that furthermore will ensure that any request of such usage by the U.S. Government be rejected.

As the article in the Australian Financial Review points out, that particular section has not been affected by the staff ceilings in the manner in which other sections of the Taxation Office have been affected. I say more generally to the honourable member for Dundas that the effect of the staff ceilings upon the Taxation Office is currently under examination by the Commissioner of Taxation and the Public Service Board. It is the desire and concern of the Commissioner and me to ensure that in no way does the imposition of staff ceiling reductions hinder to any significant degree the implementation of the Government's anti-tax avoidance program.

         —I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it a fact, as reported in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, that horse meat has been discovered by Victorian Department of Agriculture inspectors in cartons of Profreeze labelled export beef? Is it also a fact that this horse meat carried traces of methyl violet, the dye used to indicate that this meat originated from a knackery and was thus unfit for human consumption? Is it also a fact that there is no full time inspection service at knackeries to ensure that all the products of these works are comprehensively dyed with methyl violet to prevent possible substitution as product for human consumption? Does the Minister agree, therefore, that this incident of dyed pet food appearing in beef cartons highlights the serious threat to public health posed by a lack of a strong and uniform inspection service throughout Australia?

         —I am advised that traces of methyl violet have not been found in cartons examined so far. Therefore, the matter has not been referred to the Australian Federal Police by either my Department or the Victorian Department of Agriculture. As to the latter part of the question relating to the general problem of meat inspection services, the honourable member will be aware of my concern and effort for some time to get a single meat inspection service. He may also be aware that at the Australian Agricultural Council meeting on Friday this matter was discussed and it was decided that the Commonwealth and Victoria-Victoria having agreed to further talks on this matter-should meet in the next couple of weeks. There will be a meeting on 18 September to try to resolve the issue. However, I have to say that the New South Wales Government has not shown the same alacrity to try to resolve the problem concerning the introduction of a single meat inspection service. Nor has the Queensland Government shown the same alacrity. However, the Victorian Government has shown some concern in getting a single meat inspection service. I hope that, as a result of the meeting on 18 September, a further step will be taken along that line.

         —I am indebted to the honourable member for Mitchell for giving me the opportunity to expose certain facts. I am disappointed that the New South Wales Minister for Housing has seen fit to attack the policies of the Federal Government. One can only presume that he believes attack is the best means of defence. Quite obviously, he has many things to defend. I bring to the attention of the House some of the very high cost factors in New South Wales. The first is the very high cost of land. The average cost of a block of land in Sydney is $30,000; elsewhere in Australia it is $15,000. The reason is that the New South Wales Government has not seen fit to develop urban and regional development policies. I also draw to the attention of the House the fact that the cost of building per square metre is higher in Sydney than anywhere else in Australia. The cost of building an average home in Sydney is about $42,500; the cost elsewhere in Australia is $39,000. Those are some of the things for which the New South Wales Government should rightly take the blame and take up the challenge. More specifically, in money terms stamp duty collections in New South Wales increased from $121m in the previous year to $184m last year-a staggering increase of 52 per cent in the one year.

         —As I have said to the House before, the fact is that I have delisted 27 independent boning rooms and six boning rooms attached to other establishments following the discovery of horse meat in Australian meat in America. The fact is that the independent boning rooms that have export licences cannot export to America at the moment because of the requirement to lay down new and stricter procedures for them to follow. Following the delisting, yesterday I announced that three of them had already been put back on the list. Another one was put back on the list last night and more are to be put back on the list today. I can only say that, once the boning rooms make their application for relisting and satisfy my Department that they can follow the stricter security procedures in relation to the transfer of meat, they will be relisted. It is, therefore, in the hands of each boning room to make sure that its house is in order.

The Government is convinced, as I have said on other occasions, that it is in the best interests of all young unemployed people that they should be encouraged to use the Government's expanded training and work experience programs. We believe that young unemployed people can best be helped by helping them to acquire the skills, training and work experience that they need and which employers seek.

        It may be, as a result of the interviews that are presently being conducted by officers of my Department with participants in the CYSS projects and the project officers, that it emerges that some young unemployed people are unable to avail themselves of these expanded opportunities. That may be because of the geographical location of some of those concerned. The illustration which the honourable member gives may well turn out to be one such case; that is to say, there are no technical and further education colleges or similar institutions in the immediate locality. It may also be that their own unsuitability is such that some particular need emerges in some areas or with respect to some such people. Should it emerge that there are particular needs of that sort which are not catered for by the present expanded programs, then the Government will, of course, look very closely at the need for any different or new forms of assistance or special program action that might emerge. Naturally we want to give all young unemployed people positive help that meets their real needs. The Government's record on that attitude is there for all to examine. We will be looking very carefully at what emerges as a result of our investigations.

I indicate, in response to the honourable member, that as all honourable members would be aware there is no freehold of any sort in the Australian Capital Territory, either for persons of Aboriginal descent or for any other Australian citizens. However, I will look at the proposed legislation to which the honourable member referred. I have had representations both for and against the introduction of a freehold system in the Australian Capital Territory. The only other matter which I think is relevant in answer to the question raised by the honourable member is that when one looks at the granting of freehold to any group of Australians by means of an Act of Parliament one also ought to have in contemplation other Australians who do not have the chance of getting freehold, no matter what their race or origin may be.

         —I think everybody in this House will agree that a great surge of resource development is taking place. Some people even refer to it as a boom. I think it is an unfortunate word. I have said that before. It is interpreted by some people as meaning that a bust will follow. In fact, the resource development that is proceeding very strongly is the best ever in Australian history because it is based mainly on long term contracts. There will not be a bust, provided we can keep the sound progress going and retain the confidence in the industry. Most of these developments-such as those involving uranium, steaming coal or alumina-are based on long term contracts, for up to 10 years or longer in some cases. It means that the situation is very stable for people to invest huge amounts of money in these development projects. In fact, I think everybody is very proud of the impact that the development is having on the Australian economy as a whole.

        Certainly we would like to see Australians benefiting to the maximum and we would like to see more Australians participating in the ownership of these resources. The idea of an Australian trust, which has been promoted by the honourable member and by other honourable members of this House, is worthy of consideration to try to help the small investor to participate in the rewards of this sort of development. I hope that when the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System reports it will make reference to this particular aspect of encouraging people's savings into this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to refer to the criticism by the ACTU. I think it is quite unfair to reflect on the Government's policies which have been so eminently successful in getting this development going. It is because we have given stability to the economy and confidence to invest in this country to people that progress is now taking place. The policies that have emerged from the ACTU appear to me to be nothing more than a mish-mash of old, discredited, tired Australian Labor Party policies such as imposing a resources tax, establishing a hydrocarbons commission and taking over the private sector-in fact, a reintroduction of its old socialist policies.

If it introduced the policies, as it has suggested, it would bring resource development to a halt, as we previously saw when those sorts of policies were introduced by a Labor government. I think the ACTU could best help in resource development in this country if it did everything possible to discourage the irresponsible strikes that take place-strikes which do so much damage to our international trading credibility-and if it could do more to restrain the excessive wage demands that are being made. That would help considerably in the progress that is being made in resource development, which will be so valuable to every Australian.

Only two incomplete copies of that film were discovered to be in existence. The National Library's film archives, with the financial support of the Australian Film Commission, has done a remarkable job in putting together those two films to provide a nearly complete copy of the original film. The film was outstanding in its time. It would be regarded as outstanding even when measured alongside the achievements of the present day. Because of the achievements of the present day by the Australian film industry there is increasing interest in looking at films developed in the early history of that industry.

If the indications of the response received at the Sydney and Melbourne film festivals are anything to go by, the film when publicly released should be one that will attract large audiences. If honourable members have not already received notification concerning this film from me, I hope that early this afternoon when they return to their offices they will do so.

It goes without saying that in this meat fraud case I have been in very close contact with the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police on the way in which he is pursuing inquiries into the allegations that have been made. It is true that in the advice he has furnished to me he said that, in hindsight, it is a pity that investigations made in the past were not pursued with more vigour. I cannot comment on that. I was not the responsible Minister then, so I would not wish to examine what the Commissioner said in that context. One thing I would like to say because I think it is very relevant to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday is that in the advice presented to me by the Commissioner, which included the comment to which I have just referred, he has made it clear that he has never been 'nobbled by heavyweights from the highest level'-the words used by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.

I assure the House that the Australian Federal Police force, in co-operation with other concerned departments and Ministers, is pursuing this inquiry with all the vigour it can command. The Commissioner has advised me that he has given the officer in charge of the inquiry all the resources that he needs and that he stands ready to provide any more assistance that officer may ask for. In recent days I have been able to commend the Commissioner of the AFP for the personal commitment he is giving to this inquiry.

         —The Government has given consideration to the cost of pharmaceuticals. I acknowledge that the cost can be considerable in cases where, for instance, a large family may have some illness within it or where chronic illnesses occur. However, looking at the costs associated with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Government is not in a position at this stage to alter the arrangements that have been made.

         —There seems to be a fair amount of ignorance among certain members of the Opposition with respect to our training and work experience programs. I thought I had made it plain that there would be 70,000 new approvals under the work experience program in this financial year in addition to 20,000 people whose training would be carried over from the last financial year. In fact, the program could well benefit 70,000 individual people. In addition to that, of course, the transition allowance is payable. Last year we paid 8,800 of those allowances. This year we have budgeted for 16,000 allowances. The system encouraging employers to take on additional apprentices by way of rebates last year catered for 92,000 apprentices. This year 95,000 apprentices will be catered for. Other schemes also cater for a large number of people and particular programs apply to young people as well as to adults.

        I have made it perfectly plain that the Government has in place a large range of programs. Those programs have been expanded with respect both to funds and to the number of places available. The Government is quite confident that it is acting in the best interests of young unemployed people across the board. More attention should be given to those schemes by those who profess to be interested in the welfare of young unemployed people. I hope that the debate we have had over the CYSS issue will at least serve this end and that it has drawn attention to these schemes which are practical and sensible. It should be understood, perhaps more widely than it has been in some quarters, that this is a real and substantial contribution which the Government can make to the interests of young unemployed people. They must get the skills and the training they need to acquire a job and keep it and they must get the work experience which employers demand.

As Special Youth Employment Training Program subsidies are now classified under 'work experience', can employers now quite freely employ someone for the period of the subsidy and then sack him and get another person on subsidy? Has this change to the Special Youth Employment Training Program been instituted because the staff of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs have recently been insisting that special youth jobs have, firstly, a training aspect and that, therefore, barring special circumstances, a person trained on subsidy should be kept on at the end of the subsidy period? For example, does the Minister now consider it reasonable that an employer should take on a car washer on 34 weeks special youth subsidy, presumably taking 34 weeks to learn to wash a car, then to be laid off, presumably having been unsuccessful in his or her training?

         —Honourable members will be aware that in March this year I announced a major inquiry into Australia's migrant selection system-the Numerical Multifactor Assesseent System, NUMAS. This flowed from the Government's policy statement for the election last year and its previous commitment, made at the time NUMAS was introduced, to review the system after a reasonable period of operation. The objective of the review, which is still under way, is to ensure that our selection system provides, as efficiently as possible, migrants who can settle easily and make a contribution to the economic and cultural life of Australia without displacing Australians from jobs. As part of the review process, an independent Committee of Review was set up to report to me on the views of the community, as well as on the findings of a number of studies undertaken on the operation of NUMAS. The Chairman of this Committee was Dr Charles Price of the Australian National University. Other members were Mr Justice Gobbo of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Mr James Samios, President of the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales and during Mr Justice Gobbo's short absence overseas in June, Mr David Cox of the University of Melbourne.

        The Committee's findings are contained in the report which I have just tabled. Copies of this report may be purchase from Government bookshops. The Committee had the task of reporting on the operation of NUMAS. It did this by sounding community views on the operation of NUMAS and by analysing the results of a number of studies. The views of the community were obtained through a series of community forums held around Australia and through submissions which were invited by the Government. The report, in accordance with the Committee's terms of reference, contains findings but no recommendations. The Committee has done a splendid job and I am indebted to it for this report. The Committee's findings are now under consideration, and I expect that during the present parliamentary sittings I will be able to announce to the House a new migrant entry policy. I commend the report to honourable members.

         —I wish to respond to the statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). I commence with the observation that the report of the Committee of Review on Migrant Assessment is a disappointing document, and in that respect I sympathise with the Minister. The Committee concluded that it was not within its obligations, as described by its terms of reference, to submit recommendations to the Minister. In that respect I believe the Committee copped out. The Minister, in his Press release on 5 March this year relating to the setting up of this Committee, said inter alia:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        . . . the review of NUMAS is aiming to establish:
       </para>
       <para>
        whether, in the light of these findings, any changes to NUMAS are indicated- . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        whether a new selection system and, if so, what system, should be introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Neither of those very positive requirements has been responded to, and both make it explicitly clear that the Minister felt it was incumbent upon the Committee to come down with the recommendations. In the absence of recommendations one must then resort to the findings of the Committee, and again I am disappointed. There seems to be more implication than explicit assertion in relation to NUMAS, the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System. Certainly, in a comparative sense it is very strong on the English language as a prerequisite for migrant selection procedures-I think, and I stress that, because one is required to read between the lines. There seems to be a great deal of hedging in this report on any particular finding which is prescribed. For instance the very last paragraph on page 115 of the report, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Concern was expressed that a non-discriminatory policy could jeopardise social cohesion and harmony within the Australian community but there was also strong support for the retention of the present non-discriminatory policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can have it one way or we can have it the other. I repeat: I sympathise with the Minister as he seeks to navigate his way through the rather tricky course of findings that have been laid down by the Committee. I repeat that the report is disappointing. I would interpret it as a cop-out. NUMAS is clearly a problem in the community. It is a major problem for important ethnic groups within Australia. They see it as a symbol of some discrimination, some unfairness of a varying order. Some see that unfairness as being of a very large order. Certainly, it generates dissatisfaction. Its pre-occupation with the English language tends to give it an Anglo-Saxon dominance in selection procedures. I suggest that, taking everything on balance, we need a broader vision in terms of our selection procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia, as an Anglo-Saxon enclave in this part of the world, is really an anomaly. Whether we like it or not, the future of Australia increasingly will be determined by events in our region. The populations of the countries of our region have two things in common; they are all brown-skinned and none have English as their first and basic language. The implication of NUMAS is that it discriminates in favour of Anglo-Saxons. It discriminates even more in favour of English speakers and it certainly discriminates in favour of people who are higher on the socio-economic ladder. In a very important respect there is an explicit clash of principle between the application of NUMAS and the enunciated purposes of the Government's immigration policy. The Government declares that its immigration policy is based on multi-cultural principles, yet here we have a selection system which discriminates in a significant way-although not completely-against the development of such a principle.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have outlined the sorts of things that I believe are needed in this country. They are things which, had there been a different result at the last national election-it was nearly achieved-would in many cases have been applied by now, and those which would not have been applied by now would apply in the near future. I refer to the abolition of NUMAS and the introduction of a new family reunion program to enable all unmarried children of all ages to be reunited with their families. I believe that we should allow Australian residents to sponsor all their relatives, including parents. We should abolish maintenance guarantees, allow former permanent residents to return to Australia and grant citizenship to permanent Australian residents after 12 months' continuous residence-and I mean all such people. English should no longer be a prerequisite for Australian citizenship and all new citizens should automatically be enrolled on the electoral register.
       </para>

        I think we need to declare a more philosophical content to our approach to immigration. I suggest that the aim of an immigration policy for Australia should be to achieve a cohesive, pluralistic society which gathers strength and fulfilment from its diversity of composition and the sharing of common national goals. The enrichment of the Australian nation will come from the diversity of and the mutual respect among all people who go to make up the nation. In essence I am declaring that the cohesiveness and greatness of achievement of our society will be built upon variety which will strengthen tolerance rather than upon uniformity which imposes restrictiveness. There is no room for bigotry or prejudice. In that respect, thank goodness, White Australia is a crumbling hulk in a forgotten graveyard for grotesques from a public life belonging to an earlier and less thoughtful era.

        Australia is a rich country and there is a moral imperative for those who are guided by ethical standards in the daily conduct of their lives and in their sense of social responsibility that riches ought to be shared. There have been great flows of migrants to this country, especially in the post-war period. Indeed, in a very real sense, all of us, except perhaps full Aborigines, are transplants or the products of transplants from other countries-the progeny of people who came in search of an ideal and in pursuit of a better deal. In that sense Australians have been the beneficiaries of that philosophy, although the benefits are not distributed fairly. For all that I prefer to see Australia still as a haven for many of those who come here, and as a land of greater opportunity-in the variety of ways in which the word 'opportunity' can be positively interpreted-for all who reach our shores. Our immigration policy should not be based on a narrow-minded perception of the need of our industrial system and our resources development. We want to offer more than the opportunity of merely being forgotten factory fodder.

        Some people look to distant parts of the world such as England and react with shock at the social tensions and conflict that have taken place there in recent times. But it is wrong to look at the colour of the skins of people confronting authority and conclude that therefore the race of people determines that this sort of conflict is inevitable. It is wrong because many white skinned people are involved in the confrontation and clashes but it is more especially wrong because by so doing we fail to understand that those disturbing social clashes are a product of terribly harmful and quite unfairly imposed economic policies. They are a sort of social radioactive fall-out from the impact of Thatcherism on an economic system in no condition to bear that sort of devastating impact. It is wrong too because there is a far nastier conflict nearby in Northern Ireland, one of which I am aware of with melancholy concern. There all of the skins are of one colour-the same as ours.

        I am talking about a sensible multicultural immigration policy attracting people who can add to the variety and develop the harmony of our society-a non-discriminatory immigration policy, one which will enrich us materially, socially, culturally and spiritually. Australia of the year 2080 will be vastly different from the Australia of 1980. Its success, a century away, will be determined in many important respects by what we are doing today, and no less importantly than in this field.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has issued a bipartisan invitation to the Opposition on the issue of the development of immigration policy. There will be no dispute about the need for a non-discriminatory policy. But there will be areas of disputation about the numbers, about the timing of the numbers, about the composition and most of all about the treatment and support of people who arrive here. I support an immigration policy which will enlarge the population of this country. I believe that ultimately a population of something like 50 million would add a great deal of strength and security to this country, most especially in the area of economic need. But a pre-condition of this will be that increases in immigration flows must be associated with economic recovery. It is pointless to bring people to Australia on the promise of a better deal and better job opportunities and when they arrive here they discover that by government policy the economy is being screwed down and all we can offer them is the rather mean fare of unemployment benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        In composition there should be no racial bias-the principle should be the ability to settle in and participate in and enrich our way of life. We accept refugees as long as they are genuine refugees. In this respect I remind the House of the concern I expressed here a few weeks ago that the overwhelming number of Vietnamese now coming here who are being presented as refugees are no such thing. They are short-circuiting proper immigration procedures. On that score I am pleased to have noted some of the public comments of the Minister in the past several days.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it is the issue of treatment and support that gives us greatest concern on the Opposition side. There will be an increase in the intake of immigrants this year of some 10 per cent, but the budget for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be reduced by nearly 6 per cent; that is, the capacity of the Department to be attentive in an appropriate sense and a continuing sense of the needs of new arrivals will be diminished.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will be more specific. In migrant education, in spite of the forecast increase of some 10 per cent in the immigrant intake in 1981-82, the education budget will be reduced by some 3 per cent in real terms. In real terms in 1981-82 the budget for migrant education is more than 12 per cent down on that level which was provided in the Budget of 1975-the last Australian Labor Party Budget, the last Budget that really demonstrated a caring concern for immigrants as people and did not merely treat them as imports for the needs of the industrial system.
       </para>
       <para>
        If, in fact, the aid for migrant education over the past several years of the Fraser Government had equalled in real terms that provided in the 1975 Labor Budget in this area alone immigrants would be some $37m better off than they have been.
       </para>
       <para>
        One in three migrant students needs remedial assistance. Approximately every second migrant child between 10 years of age and 14 years of age has serious reading difficulties, and yet we find over this period of the Fraser Government a substantial reduction in assistance. There has been a reduction from 10 weeks to five weeks in English language training under the Australian orientation education program for Indo-Chinese refugees. In regard to community support the Budget will provide $1.87m for 118 agencies serving ethnic communities to employ social welfare workers. The description of the task comes from the Government sources. That is less than $16,000 for each agency. One cannot afford to employ a qualified stenographer with the equipment a stenographer requires with that level of support from the Government. Translating services are now in the profit making sector and are to provide profits for entrepreneurs-scarcely an appropriate area for welfare services to operate in. We find the amount allocated is nearly $1.5m-almost as much as is provided in that crucial welfare sector I have just mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to housing in 1981-82, in spite of an anticipated increase of 1,700 immigrants requiring hostel accommodation there will be a decrease in spending of over 60 per cent, and in real terms a drop of over 80 per cent on the level provided in the 1975 Labor Budget. Migrants who arrived 18 months prior to June 1981 have an unemployment rate of 15.7 per cent. The Australian rate is a little over 5 per cent. That is, the rate of unemployment for those migrants is three times higher than that which applies for Australia generally. So in whatever respect honourable members consider this matter, immigrants are being treated much less caringly, there is much less compassion, there is much less sensitive understanding of their requirements, and overlying it all there is no respect for them or a welcoming of them as individuals who can create and contribute as individuals in our society. They are being seen increasingly and exclusively as inputs for the industrial system-as just cheap factory fodder. We resent that and we reject that. Until that attitude changes it will be very difficult to obtain bipartisanship from the Labor Party in this important area of immigration policy because we respect them as people.

         —Consumer protection is, or rather should be, a prime responsibility of the national government. This Fraser Government, however, refused steadfastly to accept its moral responsibility in this area. In fact, it is backpedaling at 1,000 miles an hour-just as fast as it can-to opt out completely from this most important area of real public concern. The razor gang cuts in the area of the Trade Practices Commission highlight the total abrogation of the Government's duty and, in fact, its arrogance towards the Australian consuming public. Is that not each and every one of us? Mr Deputy Speaker, do you not think it is ludicrous that in a country as rich, sophisticated and technically advanced as Australia we are conspicuously lacking in terms of any uniform national code relating to food purity and product safety. Almost every other advanced society on this earth is in front of us in this area of governmental concern.

        We in Australia, shackled and constrained as we are by this Government's philosophical hobbles, exist not as Australians but as New South Welshmen, Victorians, South Australians, Queenslanders, Taswegians, et cetera, because almost 100 years ago our founding fathers, for whatever reason, drew funny lines on the map of Australia. We have a national defence force, albeit a fairly run down one under this Government's control, to protect us from international threat. Does anybody seriously consider that this governmental military action on a national basis is a manifestation of latent socialist tendency or rampant government monopoly? Of course they do not. Does it not strike this Government therefore that the protection of people's health and well-being throughout this nation is also a national issue? Can the Government really say that public health and safety standards should be a matter of where in Australia or in what State particular people live? Surely a person in Perth is worthy of as much protection as one in Parramatta or Prahran. Surely we Australians are entitled to expect more than this Government offers, or should I say refuses to offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fragmentation of consumer protection between State governments is just not good enough. Leaving protection of consumers to the good graces of business interests is, in most cases, like leaving a drunk in charge of a brewery or Dracula in charge of a blood bank. Self-regulation in most cases does not work given the profit motive under which most businesses operate. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), who is at the table, is living in fairyland if he thinks his recent exhortations to business to implement a stronger voluntary code of recall of dangerous products will be followed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been several notable cases in recent times of dangerous or impure products appearing on the Australian market which I feel reinforce my case. This Fraser Government has been totally delinquent in its moral responsibility to protect all Australians, all the people who elected it to government, from dangerous products-imported or otherwise. I would like to refer briefly to a few of those cases. In 1980 some insulin was produced in Australia which was released onto the market for use by people suffering from diabetes and other complaints requiring the use of insulin. The insulin was found to be faulty to the extent that it produced dangerously high levels of sugar in the blood or urine of diabetic sufferers. The company that produced that insulin was in fact a signatory to a voluntary recall code in the drug area. When it was pressed to recall that particular product, it refused. The only way that users of that insulin knew that the insulin that they may or may not have been using was dangerous was through Press reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Canberra the Canberra Times, to its disgrace, published only a very small 10-line article regarding that insulin. I think that particular case points up the fact that voluntary recall codes just do not work. It certainly needs some sort of legislative implementation by the Government to make sure that there is a compulsory recall code on dangerous products. Earlier this year in South Australia a matter arose concerning pickled onions, of all things. I know that pickled onions are a particular fascination for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), for putting in people's pockets. These particular onions were being placed in people's mouths, to their great detriment. I have a Press report here from the Adelaide Advertiser of 27 August. It reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Spring Gully Pickles Pty Ltd has recalled all its jars of pickled onions because some are believed to contain up to 12.6 times the legal amount of preservative.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cardiac sufferers and asthmatics were 'highly susceptible' to such levels of preservatives, the Metropolitan County Board warned yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone suffering from severe cardiac complaints could suffer a cardiac arrest-depending on the amount of onions eaten and preservative level in each jar . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        If all those jars had been labelled as they should have been labelled under a national code which protected people's health and, in fact, were batch coded and date stamped, the recall process would have been much more simple. But as it turned out it was very difficult to have all of those jars of pickles returned from the delicatessens where they were on sale. Consequently, the health of everybody who was exposed to those pickled onions was in jeopardy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another case which has made a fair bit of Press in the last couple of days was that relating to some bandages imported from India. It appears that these bandages are anything but as aseptic as they should be. In fact, they contain a certain amount of infection. A case was reported of a woman having to have her finger amputated after having used one of those bandages on a cut finger. I know that the Government's usual response when challenged in this area is to say that consumer affairs is a State matter. But this case highlights the total dishonesty of that claim because these bandages were imported; they had to come through Customs. If this Government undertook its proper responsibility there would be protections in this area to see that impure products are not imported into Australia. This does not happen. Now we have the problem of having to recall all of these bandages which are kept in first-aid kits all around Australia. In fact, I understand that some bandages have been used by the Army. These have to be recalled in order to protect the health of people which is prejudiced because of the lack of Government control and the lack of Government interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        More particularly, and perhaps more urgently, I refer to the very tragic case of the salami salmonella. Over the last few weeks 350 cases of salmonella poisoning, including the death of one young child, have been reported because of some salami which was manufactured in Melbourne by a highly reputable firm called Tibaldi Small Goods (Australia) Pty Ltd. That firm, in fact, has been in business in Melbourne since 1934-for 47 years. It developed a business engaged in making salami and other small goods. Within the meat industry it is respected as being probably the most highly quality conscious and purity conscious company in that area. But because of some accident in its factory some salami was produced which, in fact, included some salmonella newport, a very dangerous bacterial form of salmonella. Salmonella is a very emotive term, I guess. People tend to be scared of it but they should not be because salmonella is found in almost every animal that is killed for human consumption. It is found, very commonly, in most humans. I guarantee that if all of us in this chamber were tested for salmonella at the moment some residual level of salmonella infection would be found within us but not at a dangerous level. It is only dangerous when it manifests itself in the form of salmonella newport.
       </para>
       <para>
        This salmonella could have found its way into the salami or into the product which was used to make that salami from the piggery, from the abattoirs, during the production process or even at the delicatessen. But the result was that 350 people became sick and one boy died. The most tragic point about that boy's death was that it occurred three weeks after the first case of salmonella poisoning was reported in Melbourne and the first person was admitted to the Fairfield Hospital for infectious diseases. The simple fact is that if we had a national code which required people manufacturing salami or people engaged in other manufacturing food industries to batch code their products, it would be a simple matter to have them returned.
       </para>
       <para>
        To its eternal credit, Tibaldi took every possible action to try to get all of its product back, at great expense and to its great embarrassment. If the Government had implemented the recommendations of the National Health and Research Council regarding date stamping and batch coding, recall would have been much more simple and more prompt. The culprit in this case was the Government. I have no desire to score political points from the death of an innocent child but if a lesson is learned from the death of that child perhaps his death is not in vain. The aim of the Government should be to redress the imbalance of power between the supplier and the consumer. Consumer protection should not become bogged down in the continuing controversy over State rights. At a meeting held in 1974, convened by my colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison), then the Minister for Science and Technology, between all the State Ministers involved in the consumer affairs area, they all agreed that responsibility for setting consumer standards belonged rightly with the national government. The States agree, the industries agree, consumer organisations agree, but the Fraser Government is out of step.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to putting to the Government a case which indicates that it has a capacity to introduce national legislation in this area. I know that the Minister probably will say that it is the States' responsibility to do that. I suggest that in this area various roles should be played by bodies under the control of the Commonwealth Government. Specifically, I want to say a few words about the Trade Practices Commission and the Trade Practices Act which it administers. It is worth emphasising at the outset that the Commonwealth Government has ample power under the Constitution to make laws with respect to consumer protection in general and product safety and production information standards in particular. There is scope under the corporations, interstate and international trade, Territories and even the foreign affairs powers for the Commonwealth to make national uniform and far-reaching laws, which are so badly needed. The judgments of the High Court on section 92 are clear and consistent, at least on the Commonwealth's authority to make laws to regulate trade when such regulation is to promote the health and well-being of the population and to make trade safe. Section 92 is no impediment to a national code. Yet because of either lack of interest or a misplaced faith in Dickensian economics, successive Liberal Ministers have not made the best use of the powers given under the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, the Trade Practices Commission is under-resourced and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act are seriously deficient. I deal first with the state of the legislation. The States have a multiplicity of legislation, much of which is poorly drafted and confusing to business and consumers alike. Varying standards placed on products from one State to another place added costs on business. Business would prefer one uniform national product safety and information code. The Trade Practices Act could embrace such a code. In contrast, only three States-New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-have any thing approaching coherent statute law in that area. The Trade Practices Act has two major deficiencies. Sections 62 and 63 of the Act purport to cover the field but they contain major omissions. The Act contains no provision whereby a manufacturer or other supplier can be required to take steps to recall defective goods which have been supplied in breach of section 62. Some ancillary orders are available, by the procedures are slow and not satisfactory for a number of technical reasons. Following amendments brought in by this Government in 1977, sections 62 and 63 of the Trade Practices Act do not apply to goods that are intended for export. That exemption goes to the very heart of our recent problems in the meat industry. If goods go abroad, we just do not care. I do not think that is a way to promote good trading relations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn briefly to the treatment of the Commission. The Commission has suffered two severe staff cutbacks since December last year. The Commission even has a contingency plan to abolish its consumer protection division and its State offices no longer have separate consumer protection sections. That has diminished rather than increased co-operation with State agencies. It has meant that information spreads less quickly through the national network of consumer bodies, with the type of result to which I referred earlier. The Government just does not understand that the Trade Practices Commission is there to promote competition and the making of the market. As I said earlier, that lack of understanding is matched by disinterest and neglect. I ask honourable members to consider the pathetically small number of regulations made by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs setting product safety standards. There were only six. Summing up, I assert that the Government has been quite delinquent in refusing to accept that the health of the people of this nation should be a subject of national concern.

         —I welcome the initiative of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) in bringing forward this matter. The Government, far from resting in fairyland, as he claimed, is very conscious of the role played by the Trade Practices Commission and the consumer organisations. After all, we believe in private enterprise. As a consequence, the consumer is king, and to meet his demands is the ultimate aim of any manufacturer, provider of services or anybody involved in the market-place. This basic misunderstanding by the socialists of the problem of the market-place is not new; it is very consistent. In similar debates I have noticed that the socialist cause has always been dominated by the belief that government must control. The socialists say: 'Let us have more regulations, let us have more rules. Do not have self-regulation which might be understood by the manufacturers, the consumers or people who might be interested in what is going on. Instead of self-regulation let us have yet another government body'.

        One of the problems in administration is that there is far too great a gap between bureaucracy and the general consumers of Australia; there is far too great a gap between business and government. To create a government agency to review and regulate everything that moves in the nation will surely stifle business, competition and enterprise. That is something which the Government does not stand for; certainly I do not stand for it. I am a great believer in the role of private enterprise and I know that the honourable member for Parramatta is secretly an admirer of it also. When he referred to fairyland I thought he might have been misconstruing some of his private enterprise background.

        To top off what I have said already, I can only point to the fact that there are such things as State governments and that the State governments existed a long time before the Federal Government came into being. Under the Constitution of Australia the States ceded to the Canberra Government, then based in Melbourne, a series of powers. This Government has not sought to interfere with those powers. In a number of areas we have attempted to adopt a co-operative federalist approach, be it in relation to companies and securities or consumer affairs. Because of that we have had to look at the co-ordination of the various roles of the States. It is true, as the honourable member for Parramatta said, that business would like to have one standard applying to all States, not one standard in Queensland, one in Western Australia and one in yet another State. It does wish to see movement in that area.

         —I am glad the honourable member brought that up. Clearly he has not looked at the way in which the ministerial council of consumer affairs has moved to bring labelling into the national sphere. Very great advances have been made in that area with the full co-operation of all the States. I am not denying for a minute that negotiation with the States is difficult and time consuming, but in the overall interest of the whole of Australia it is pretty clear to me that negotiation is the most appropriate course. I believe that self-regulation is the best way in which any industry can provide for the consumer. That does not mean to say that there should be a closed shop operation in which certain areas of the private sector do not really welcome competition; the system must ensure that they do welcome it. But, properly seen to, self-regulation certainly provides the best product and the best performance for consumers.

        The honourable member for Parramatta had some pickle problems with onions and perhaps some other produce. I think that the general area of food in Australia is one area in which there has been some co-operation. All the State Health Ministers have agreed to what is referred to as the model food legislation. In 1980 Queensland passed the relevant legislation. We are now waiting for the other States, including New South Wales-that famous Premier State-to pass similar legislation. If the State governments would go along with what their Ministers agreed to and implement legislation--

         —If it was too conservative, why did the New South Wales Minister for Health agree to it? He agreed to it in the ministerial council. He had better get on with it rather than standing back and saying nothing is wrong. That legislation provides for mandatory recall and destruction or denaturising of adulterated food. That would cover all the aspects raised today by the honourable member for Parramatta in relation to a variety of food products. On top of that, a national register of banned and recalled food products has been evolved in association with departments and statutory authorities, including the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, State and Territory departments of business and consumer affairs, health, and primary industry, and the Trade Practices Commission. These people have all made a contribution to the establishment of the national register. All States, once they invoke the legislation, will be far better placed to provide the sort of protection that the Commonwealth would like to see for all Australians. By doing this we have, I think, made a significant contribution in this area.

        The honourable member for Parramatta raised a couple of other points in relation to the contamination of certain products imported into Australia. These, of course, have to be faced up to. The products were recalled in conjunction with the State Ministers after testing. It is not possible in real life to sample every product that enters Australia. If we were to stand at the ports of entry into Australia and physically sample every product that came across the dock there would not be an employment force in any other part of Australia. A sampling process must be embraced. Of course, this requires a certain time delay. Nevertheless, it was undertaken by the Commonwealth investigating body, the National Biological Standards Laboratory. As a consequence, in co-ordination with the State Health Ministers, the offending contaminated wound dressings were recalled. I can only point to that as an area in which positive action was taken by co-operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was also alleged that somewhere along the trail we are not using the provisions of the Trade Practices Commission to ban unsafe goods. Quite clearly that is wrong. I do not know the precise number of unsafe goods which have been banned but I refer the honourable member for Parramatta to the answer to question on notice No. 49. The question was asked by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). He asked how many goods had been banned under the Trade Practices Act since the introduction of provisions empowering the declaration of consumer products safety standards and the banning of the sale of unsafe goods. The answer contained a whole page of such goods. I do not know the number but it is certainly more than the six items which, I think, was the number used by the honourable member for Parramatta.

        Frequently the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs has activated himself in relation to toy standards. In the last Christmas period New South Wales held a series of tests on one particular toy and as a consequence banned the product. Victoria and Tasmania checked the same toy. They applied a test and decided that it was not unsafe and no ban was enforced. South Australia conducted the same test as New South Wales but got a different result and decided to take no action. In those varying circumstances the Commonwealth decided to seek co-operation and to review the reports as a whole. As a consequence we took no action. There is no doubt that toys are a very emotive area. They certainly cause concern to parents throughout the nation. The ministerial council for consumer affairs has asked the Australian Standards Association to bring forward for its consideration a product information standard for determining these sorts of problems in the future. These products are of concern to parents. I certainly agree that if we can bring about a rationalisation of consumer demands in this area it will be most encouraging.

        I am surprised that the honourable member for Parramatta did not take some interest in fireworks. That is an area with which the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales has had a particular relationship. It has caused considerable concern in consumer affairs. The ALP had a big fireworks party. A particular brand of a firework-the Horse brand magical roman candle was sold by the ALP despite the fact that it had been banned by the New South Wales Government. The firework was still being sold by the ALP branch in Sussex Street at the time that it was banned by the Government. Eventually the ALP caught up. I have no doubt that some of the great big balls of fire-no doubt they were coloured red-that were pouring out were all good for the sideshow that goes on in the New South Wales branch of the ALP. That incident bears a resemblance to the type of multicoloured, multihanded approach that the ALP has to consumer policies. They are a mishmash of confused views which do not coincide with the requirements of Australian consumers. They certainly do not meet the real desires and aspirations of the manufacturers and providers of goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure a Labor government would not understand that it takes two people to make a market. There must be a buyer and a seller. Quite clearly, the buyer will not be in the market place if the goods are seen to be inadequate or, if food is concerned, not suitable for consumption. They will certainly not buy toys if they are seen to be inadequate. In view of those circumstances the very real discipline of market forces will win through and make sure that the producers in this nation meet the market in terms of price, quality and supply. Because of that the matter brought forward today by the honourable member for Parramatta falls rather flat.

         —The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) in his reply to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has given us a great deal of justification for his being the Minister for business but very little justification for his being also the Minister for consumer affairs. He has explained to the House why this Government has abrogated its responsibility to protect Australian consumers. He has attempted to give us an argument that the market place should be allowed to control everything in Australia. It is the view of the Australian Labor Party that in certain areas the Federal Government has a responsibility to take control. The honourable member for Parramatta has given many examples of this, particularly as it applies to the need for adequate protection to ensure food standards. However, before I extend that point I will give the House some other examples which highlight the great neglect that we have seen in Australia over the last five years. I have been able to gather a few examples in the last few months.

        The Adelaide Advertiser on 11 July this year reported that a health food company was fined a mere $500 for selling chocolate bars and muesli bars infested with insects and beetle larvae. The Sunday Telegraph on 29 March this year contained an article discussing the use of cleaning fluid to decaffinate coffee beans. The use of a dangerous chemical stain remover, called trichlorethylene, and other dangerous inorganic solvents was banned by United States food and drug authorities after they discovered cancers in animals who were fed traces of the chemical. Any controls which exist in Australia apparently are implemented only after United States authorities have taken action. In the meantime, Australian consumers suffer from government inaction. The Canberra Times on 20 February this year contained a report about a brand of mineral water with excessive levels of radium. The problem was first noticed in Queensland and the other States subsequently recalled their stocks.

        This is a ludicrous situation. An unsafe product is unsafe wherever it is sold in Australia. Consumers should not have to wait for seven sets of State machinery to take action on a problem. Uniform national standards are clearly in the best interests of all Australian consumers. We need protection not only from unsafe or contaminated products but also from inadequate or untruthful labelling or advertising.

        The Sydney Daily Telegraph of 31 March this year carried a report about the lack of meat in the famous Aussie meat pie. I think we can put 'meat' in inverted commas these days. The Sydney Morning Herald of 13 July 1981 carried a warning from the Cattlemen's Union that consumers, when buying meat, have no way of knowing whether it came from prime cattle or old cows. These days we can add horses or kangaroos. It is interesting that the spokesman also said that the beef industry had concentrated mainly on the export markets and had paid little attention to domestic consumers. If the recent beef export fiasco is the result of concentration by the industry on the export market, God help the local consumers. But these examples are only a small sample which serves to indicate that Australian consumer standards are well below those of overseas. For example, in the United States the supreme courts have outstripped their government counterparts and have established a large body of judge-made law giving direct rights of action against the manufacturer. I noticed with interest an article in the Australian recently which said that to find a decomposed cockroach in one's breakfast cereal in the United States is better than winning a $1m lottery. Australian laws do not protect people to anything like that sort of degree because we have no real uniform legislation. The recent kangaroo meat scandal and the examples I have mentioned clearly indicate the need for effective consumer protection. The 'she's all right mate' mentality displayed in recent weeks over the export of contaminated meat is deplorable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party recognises that it is more difficult these days for the consumer to decide on the best value between a large range of competing products. Consumers are in a weaker position than producers and suppliers who know how their products compare but do not pass the information on to consumers. National legislation is necessary to ensure that the information provided to consumers is not misleading or deceptive. But we do not want to make life hard for businessmen by harnessing manufacturers or shackling them and the ALP clearly recognises that, despite the accusations that we have just heard from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Suppliers themselves know the advantages of having to deal with only one set of laws. Manufacturers themselves have called for national food legislation because different State laws and regulations mean that they have to meet different requirements. What we are doing is acting alongside many of the manufacturers. Life would be made much easier for them if they knew the national laws with which they had to comply. Under the present system, instead of producing one food item for all of Australia, costs are increased because six different State laws have to be met. In this case industry and the Labor Party have one interest in common-reducing unnecessary cost and thus saving money for the consumer. Obviously this does not interest the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Party has a completely different outlook from that of the present Government with regard to consumer protection. We would do two things. Firstly, we would enforce the consumer provisions which are already in our legislation and which Liberal-Country Party coalitions prefer to let lie idle. For instance, under the Trade Practices Act the Commonwealth Government has the power to ban the sale of unsafe goods, as the Minister has outlined. But really what has it done? Do not tell me that every product in the market place is completely safe. That is simply not the case. In fact we know that there are hazardous products in the market because the Labor Party has already taken action with regard to many of them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us consider the example of the toy referred to by the Minister in his speech. This toy, a hydropneumatic rocket, was banned from sale in New South Wales. The toy had been tested by the department of Mr Einfeld, the New South Wales Minister responsible for consumer affairs, and had been clocked at speeds of up to 650 kilometres an hour, even though it was labelled as being suitable for use by children of up to eight years of age. The Federal Minister was correct when he said that other State governments decided not to ban the toy. But in the Australian Capital Territory we were faced with the situation that over the border the toy was banned but, because the Government would not act within its powers, the toy could come over the border from Queanbeyan to Canberra to be sold. That situation just is not good enough. Is it really good enough to have a toy which is able to move at speeds of up to 650 kilometres an hour and which can be played with by children of up to eight years of age? It is not good enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of consumer protection carried out by the Federal Minister's department is to be cut back even further now. It has been reported, as a result of the Lynch razor gang recommendations, that consumer protection areas in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs are to be further scaled down by 'more selective complaints and investigations, reduced adjudication work, reduced education functions and safety and information standards monitoring'. This area of consumer product safety is a glaring example of the inadequacies of the Government in protecting the consumer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second major aspect of the ALP's consumer protection policy is our belief that it is essential to have a seperate department of consumer affairs to co-ordinate consumer affairs functions and to be responsible for the enforcement of legislation. We believe it is totally incongruous to combine the business portfolio with that of consumer affairs. We intend to take action in that respect by establishing a separate department of consumer affairs so that we would have one body, not a whole range of departments, controlling and operating proper and effective consumer protection in Australia. Because there has been so little action in this area, which in fact covers a whole range of areas, this 'it's all right Jack' mentality with respect to consumers exists under this Government and has led to people in Australia just accepting things without questioning their rights in the area. I believe there is a great need for consumer education and the Labor Party would act on this.

         —I must admit that I have some sympathy on this subject with members of the Opposition, although not so much with the substance of their call for the Commonwealth to implement legislation, because I have some doubts as to whether the Commonwealth has that capacity. I share some of their concerns that there are a number of products, whether they be food products, recreational products or whatever, including chemicals, that give cause for concern in this country. I recall being presented a number of years ago in Japan during a visit there with a gas table lighter which was operated simply by applying pressure to the side of it. Not being a very bright individual I packed the lighter in my suitcase with the net result that the suitcase was set alight because of the pressure of clothes on the lever. I can only say that it was fortunate that my suitcase was burnt while it was in the hotel in Japan and not in the baggage compartment of the aircraft I flew on. That incident brought home to me how easy it was to bring into this country, or for another country to manufacture, a product which was quite blatantly unsafe, considering the uses to which it could be put and the circumstances under which it could be transported.

        In this debate we have looked at a number of issues. We have heard about pickled onions, salmonella, salami and contaminated bandages. We have talked about the exportation of contaminated meat and about the consumption of contaminated meat products within Australia. We have discussed Rapitard insulin, toys and fireworks. Flammable clothing is one matter we have not talked about, but we could very well do so. We have not yet mentioned the rather disastrous circumstances that surround toxic shock syndrome and tampons in the United States and to a much lesser degree in Australia. In the time available I wish to use some of those examples to point out how various means of control-whether voluntary, or the responsibility of the manufacturers or distributors, or by State governments, or the Commonwealth Government in association with the States-have to some extent worked.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe we should follow the line advocated by the Opposition speakers that all power, all responsibility, all control, and all administration in this area should be vested solely with the Commonwealth. Responsibility must also lie with the manufacturers, the distributors, the wholesalers, perhaps the retailers, and with the State governments, who are responsible for much of the legislation that applies in the area of consumer protection. Of course, other areas which are very clearly the responsibility of the Commonwealth are those involving prohibited imports, which come under the Customs regulations, and the Trade Practices Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has pointed out that some measures have been taken under those two pieces of legislation. I agree with the Opposition that it is not a very exhaustive list. In fact, only 12 goods or classes have been banned as unsafe under the Trade Practices Act and, as of earlier this year, only 10 consumer product safety standards have been declared. Some of those standards apply to things such as children's night garments and their flammability. In my opinion, that is something that should have been done long ago, and the States have been just as irresponsible, or at least as slow in moving in this area, as the Commonwealth. Buoyancy aids is another area where it was only relatively recently that some fairly strict standards were laid down, particularly in relation to aids for children. We can all recall cases where children have drowned or nearly drowned as a result of unsatisfactory buoyancy aids. I compliment the Minister and his Department for imposing those safety standards, but at the same time I believe that they are only just a start. There are many other areas where further standards could be introduced.

         —No, not necessarily. I am just taking a bob each way. Let us look at some of the areas to which the Minister referred. He advocated that there was a need and an opportunity for voluntary codes in many areas of consumer protection. A good example of voluntary response occurred late last year and early this year in relation to toxic shock syndrome and the use of certain tampons containing carboxy-methyl-cellulose. In October 1980 the Minister for Health, through the National Biological Standards Laboratory, released a statement saying that in America there had been a number of instances of TSS associated with certain tampons. The Laboratory considered that there was a very small risk of TSS through the use of such tampons in Australia, and fairly detailed suggestions for the use and handling of these products were given by the Minister in October 1980. I think that in that case the Minister for Health made a fairly responsible statement, and it was made, as a result of some circumstances that had occurred in the United States, well before any case of TSS was identified in Australia. We know that in January this year a case of TSS was identified in Melbourne, and again it was associated with one of these products containing carboxy-methyl-cellulose. Again the Minister made a statement which, from memory, was well reported. It confirmed that the bacterium staphylococcus aureus was associated with this product, and very clear instructions were put out by the Minister as to what women who use this product should do. The manufacturer and the parent company were very quick to apply a voluntary code, and immediately withdrew that product from the market. I think that was a very effective example--

In March this year, after pretty exhaustive examination by the National Biological Standards Laboratory and some independent bodies, it was shown that the products available on the market in Australia had not contained staphylococcus aureus and that manufacturing facilties had been inspected and declared satisfactory. The voluntary freeze was discontinued, and to my knowledge there has been no further problem. Indeed, there is some significant doubt as to whether it was the tampons or their ingredients that caused these few cases of toxic shock syndrome.

        Let us consider another example. The National Biological Standards Laboratory identified pathogenic bacteria in certain wound dressings and bandages imported from India. To my knowledge, it was not brought to the Government's attention by users but was identified in routine testing and examination undertaken by the Laboratory. Again, that is an example of checks in progress, checks which have identified unsatisfactory products, and consequently appropriate action has been taken. This is not to say that in every instance this has been a satisfactory way of handling the matter. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has pointed out quite rightly that the salmonella scare with Tibaldi salami in Melbourne is a matter that should have been covered by State and perhaps Commonwealth legislation.

        It is interesting to note that if the codes recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council on food labelling, batch coding at manufacture, and date stamping had been followed in this case-these codes were established several years ago, but I understand that only New South Wales has taken up date stamping and batch coding-it would have been much easier to trace the source of infected and contaminated salami. That may well have prevented not only the death that occurred but also the severe illnesses that resulted from eating the product. In this case the code has been developed by an agency of the Commonwealth, and it is up to the States to accept the code and to implement legislation accordingly. Likewise, on the model food legislation, I am informed by the Minister's office that only one State, namely Queensland, has accepted the thrust of the legislative recommendations relating to the destruction, denaturing and otherwise disposing of food products that are unsatisfactory and may be dangerous to public health.

        I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, and in the short time available to me I wish to outline another area of considerable concern relating to hazardous chemicals. The Committee is conducting a very comprehensive inquiry into hazardous chemicals in Australia, and it is rather disturbing to find that in practice there is virtually no requirement for the correct labelling of hazardous chemicals, some of which are certainly dangerous to public health, some of which are suspected of being carcinogenic. I think the discussion on this subject has been useful. I do not accept the Opposition's proposition that control should be entirely the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. It is a responsibility that should be shared between the Commonwealth, the States, and the manufacturers. I suggest that this is a matter of national importance and should be shared by all those bodies.

         —The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 is not the most exciting piece of legislation to come before the House in this session. Indeed, the fact that I am the only person listed to speak about the Bill indicates that it has not exactly grabbed the imagination of the Parliament. However, that is not to say that it is not an important piece of legislation. It gives effect to a taxation agreement which has been negotiated between Australia and Denmark. The agreement is essentially the same as several others that have been negotiated between Australia and other countries in recent years, none of which has been opposed by the Opposition. Countries with which we already have such agreements are the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, West Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Philippines, Malaysia and Sweden. We have not opposed the application of any of those agreements, nor do we oppose the application of such an agreement now between Australia and Denmark.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        All these agreements relate to taxation of income, both of individuals and enterprises, and have three essential purposes. Firstly, they aim to prevent double taxation of income where the income is earned in a country which is not the taxpayer's country of residence. Without such agreements it is possible that the same income could be taxed in both countries without allowance for tax paid in the other. Secondly, the agreements aim to simplify the obligations of taxpayers so that they know how their income earned in a country other than their country of residence will be taxed; and, thirdly, they aim to prevent avoidance of tax on income by taxpayers who are able to use the international scale of operations to manipulate their affairs so as to avoid tax in one or both of the countries involved. Such reasons seem to the Opposition to be worthy of support. We are especially concerned that tax avoidance through transfer pricing, as it is known-that is, pricing of goods or services that are sold from one branch of a transnational corporation to another at artifically high or low levels designed to minimise the transnational corporation's global taxation and to maximise after tax profits-should be eliminated.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the opportunities for such tax avoidance are ever increasing as transnational corporations control an increasing proportion of world trade. The Brandt report, as it is known-the report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, headed by Willy Brandt, the former West German Chancellor-which was published last year, pointed out that the best estimation that could be made at that time was that between one quarter and one third of all world production was controlled by transnational corporations and that intra-firm international trade, that is, trade between branches of subsidiaries of transnational corporations in different countries, accounted for over 30 per cent of all world trade. Thus the opportunities for transfer pricing are rife not only in regard to goods but also in regard to services provided. As these already large scale transnational corporations penetrate our industries in an ever greater degree, especially in mining and manufacturing, there is an ever increasing opportunity for transfer pricing to be used to avoid Australia company tax. No estimate is given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or the Australian Taxation Office of which I am aware of the possible loss of revenues involved.

         —As I was saying, there is no authoritative estimate as to the kind of tax losses involved through tax avoidance as a result of transfer pricing, but Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association estimated earlier this year, on advice given to him, which he says was from an authoritative source-I have checked this personally with him-that in the Melbourne Taxation Office alone the annual loss of revenue through the use of tax havens and transfer pricing amounts to something of the order of $2,000m. Extrapolating that figure to the national level, given that there is a high percentage of company head offices in Melbourne, this would mean an annual loss of between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Whether in reality that is a gross exaggeration or an approximation I cannot be sure, but Mr Risstrom asserts that it is a realistic assessment of the tax losses. If he is even remotely correct we are talking about a massive and extraordinary loss of tax revenue through the operation of such measures as transfer pricing and the use of international tax havens.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The importance of a double tax agreement in regard to transfer pricing is that it does two things. The double tax agreement supplements the existing taxation law and also makes it easier to obtain the information needed to overcome tax avoidance by the use of such devices as transfer pricing. With regard to the first aspect-that of supplementing the existing law-I suppose it needs to be said that the international agreements override the existing taxation law and so give additional power to control transfer pricing. Such an agreement commonly provides, as does the agreement now before the House, that where an enterprise in one country carries on a business in another country through a permanent establishment, the recorded profits of that establishment or firm can be re-arranged by the tax authorities in the latter country to show for tax purposes the profits that would have been earned had the enterprise been wholly independent of its parent or associated company. This power to re-arrange profits for tax purposes is a very important one. The fact that such a power is provided by the double tax agreement considerably increases the power of the Taxation Office to overcome some transfer pricing activities. In effect, the double tax agreement enables the Taxation Office to employ the arms length principle; to treat enterprises which are related to enterprises overseas as though they were totally independent of the overseas enterprise, to assess what the real market price of the goods or services transferred between them really is, to adjust their profits accordingly and to tax them on that re-arranged profit.
       </para>
       <para>
        This provision is of special importance when the national law relating to transfer pricing is weak and ineffective, as ours has been and still is. Section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act purports to deal with transfer pricing but, for reasons that I explained in a speech in this House on 1 April this year, it has been rendered quite useless by various High Court interpretations. Thus the only effective law we have against transfer pricing at present is that which is contained in the double tax agreements. This is not to say, however, that it does not matter if section 136 is ineffective. Indeed, it matters greatly, because double tax agreements give no protection against transfer pricing with enterprises in countries with which we have no such agreement. This is important not only because it means that transfer pricing through many countries is not covered but also because transnational corporations based in countries with which we have a double tax agreement can interpose a third country with which we have no such agreement and so avoid the impact of the double tax agreement on the transfer pricing activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is essentially what happened in the Commonwealth Aluminium case decided by the High Court last year. In that case the Australian company sold bauxite to Japanese buyers through a company jointly established in Hong Kong by the Australian company and the Japanese buyers. The price to the Hong Kong company was artificially low but the price from the Hong Kong company to the Japanese buyers was roughly the real market price. The profits were therefore made in Hong Kong rather than Australia. As the Hong Kong company tax rate is 15 per cent to 17 per cent compared with Australia's company tax rate of 46 per cent, the after tax profits were thereby greatly increased and were shared equally between the Australian company and the Japanese buyers who jointly established that Hong Kong company.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that such blatant tax avoidance could occur despite a double tax agreement between Australia and Japan shows that it is absolutely essential to have an effective national law against transfer pricing, the effectiveness of which can be considerably enhanced by the exchange of information provisions of the double tax agreement. The exchange of information provisions generally require each of the countries involved to exchange information for the carrying out not only of the agreement as a whole but also of the domestic laws of each country in regard to the taxation of income and so enhance the effectiveness of the national laws against tax avoidance by means of transfer pricing. This is of great importance because clearly the prevention of tax avoidance by transfer pricing requires not only that the laws be upheld by the courts and therefore be effective in that sense, but also that the Commissioner of Taxation be able to obtain the information necessary to prove that transfer pricing has taken place and to fairly reconstruct the company's profits to display what profit would have prevailed in an arms-length transaction. The agreement now before the House contains such an information exchange provision, as in fact I think do all of the other double tax agreements, and so helps to ensure that the Commissioner of Taxation is able to obtain the necessary information for the prevention of tax avoidance by transfer pricing between companies operating in Denmark and Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that such agreements help in these ways does not, however, as I have already explained, overcome the deficiencies in our national taxation law. For that reason we welcome the statement by the Treasurer on 27 May this year that the Government intends to legislate to amend section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove the deficiencies so clearly exposed by the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case. That statement by the Treasurer was made as an addendum to this second reading speech on the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 to introduce the new Part IVA into the Income Tax Assessment Act. That was a renewed attempt to achieve an effective annihilation provision against blatant tax avoidance schemes in general. Debate after the Treasurer's statement did not centre on the section 136 announcement but rather on the Part IV element, which was the subject of the Bill before the House.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Opposition I say now that we strongly welcome the Government's long overdue announcement of an intention to legislate to revise section 136. We have been calling for such action for at least the past two and a half years. Indeed, it has been clear since the Asprey Taxation Review Committee reported in early 1975 that section 136 had basic deficiencies that rendered it quite ineffective. The Asprey Committee recommended that amendments be introduced but nothing has been done until now, some six and a half years later.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of aspects of the foreshadowed legislation of which we approve and some aspects which cause us some concern. I shall refer briefly to both of those elements-firstly, aspects of the Treasurer's speech of which we strongly approve. He said in his statement on 27 May that the legislation to revise section 136 would apply from the date of that speech. We have not seen the legislation yet, but presumably when it comes in it will be, as he said then, backdated to 27 May. We applaud that limited element of retrospectivity. It is just a pity that it was not brought in much sooner, particularly if Mr Risstrom is anything like right in his estimates of the tax losses involved. Secondly, we note with great interest that in that statement on 27 May the Treasurer said that the tax avoidance which will be covered by the revised section 136 need not be the dominant purpose of an arrangement but merely one of a complex mixture of tax and other arrangements. This notion of a not merely incidental purpose is directly contrary to the test applied in Part IVA and conforms to Labor's ideas on what Part IVA should have included. When we debated Part IVA, which in general we supported, it was a very strong part of our criticism that it was too weak in the sense that it required that tax avoidance to be the dominant purpose of a transaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in the same speech in which the Treasurer launched that legislation and in which he claimed that such a dominant purpose would have to be shown for a transaction to be covered by part IVA he went on to foreshadow legislation amending section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to cover transfer pricing. He said that it would not be necessary to show that the dominant purpose was in fact tax avoidance for the revised section 136 to act against such a transaction. That seems to be an extraordinary contrast.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is appropriate to apply not merely an incidental purpose test in regard to section 136, which we thoroughly applaud, why do we not also have such an approach to part IVA? It seems to me to be quite extraordinary that in the course of the one speech the Treasurer was capable of saying that one form of test should apply in respect of one form of tax avoidance scheme but that in respect of another set of tax avoidance schemes relating to transfer pricing another test should apply. There seems to be an extraordinary inconsistency there. In regard to section 136 I do not in any way wish to criticise the Treasurer for establishing the test which he has foreshadowed he will apply, which is that the transaction need not be the dominant purpose of an arrangement in order for it to be covered by legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A third aspect of which I approve and to which I refer briefly is that the guidelines given to the Commissioner of Taxation to reconstruct transactions and to recast taxable income, according to the Treasurer's statement, enable him to use explicitly the arm's length provision which is already embodied in double tax agreements and forms the basis of United States of America anti-transfer pricing arrangements. Section 136, as it currently stands, does not specifically authorise the use of that principle. That is one reason why that section is ineffective. Even if one can get it to apply to a situation-given the High Court interpretations that seems not to be the case at present in most instances-the Commissioner of Taxation then faces the problem of how he should go about reconstructing the transactions so that he can come up with a profit which is more taxable than the one which is nominally shown. It does not give him the specific authorisation to use an arm's length principle, and that is a deficiency in that legislation. From what the Treasurer has now said, the Commissioner will certainly have that power, and we applaud that.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was also said by the Treasurer that if there is no basis available on which to determine an arm's length price, such as in monopoly situations and particularly in vertically integrated situations, the Commissioner will be able to assess taxable income on whatever amount he deems appropriate subject to review by the courts and boards of review. We also approve of that and note that there are various ways in which that can be done. These have been set out in Recommendation on the Determination of Transfer Prices Between Associated Enterprises, which is a publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We note also that the Treasurer said in his statement of 27 May that business and non-business transactions and all forms of receipts or potential deductions will be covered. We think that is also highly appropriate rather than a more restrictive view of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although we applaud all those aspects, I have just a few elements of concern. Firstly, we note that section 136 has fallen down in the need to show that a business is controlled principally by non-residents and on behalf of non-residents. This has been easily overcome by interposing a resident company or a majority of Australian directors, as in the case of Commonwealth Aluminium, who still act in the interests of foreign shareholders. The Treasurer in his statement has given no indication of how this problem will be resolved. This may be covered by referring to parties not acting at arm's length or by reference to associated parties, as in double tax agreements, or by defining indirect control. But the Treasurer has not spelt that out. We presume that he will do so in the legislation, but it seems that it would have been appropriate to mention that in his statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps more serious is the Treasurer's statement that the penalty tax applicable in such situations should be of the order of only 10 per cent. That contrasts strongly with the 200 per cent maximum penalty tax which is to apply in the case of Part IVA. Again I remind the House that that statement by the Treasurer was part of a speech in which he announced to the House his new legislation for Part IVA, under which there is a 200 per cent tax avoidance penalty. But now the maximum penalty to apply in respect of transfer pricing arrangements is 10 per cent. There is an extraordinary difference and no real reason that we can see why there should be any such difference. Is one to argue that tax avoidance through a blatant tax avoidance scheme of a Curran type is any more heinous than the tax avoidance in the Commonwealth Aluminium case involving transfer pricing? I do not think one can argue that one is worse than the other. It seems quite remarkable to have such an extraordinary difference in the degree of penalty. I foreshadow that if the legislation, when it comes forward, contains the penalty provision which the Treasurer has foreshadowed we would be critical of it and probably would move to amend it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I refer to some other problem areas which are not covered by the proposed legislation. If we are concerned about tax avoidance through international transactions, more than transfer pricing is involved. As I said in my statement to this House on 1 April this year when we were discussing other double tax agreements, we should be looking also at arrangements made by Australian residents to reduce their income tax obligations through international transactions such as through the operations of section 23Q of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the lack of a foreign tax credit scheme. The use of foreign tax havens is rife as shown by Mr Risstrom's statement, and much more than transfer pricing is involved if we are really to clean up this area of the tax law. I recommend to the Treasurer that he do a thorough job-he would not deal with just one aspect, although admittedly an important one-by cleaning up these other areas of blatant tax avoidance.

In response to a question from the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) during Question Time today, I stated that I was advised that traces of methyl violet had not been found in cartons examined so far bearing 14OC markings and that therefore the matter of dyed meat had not been referred to the Australian Federal Police either by the Department of Primary Industry or by the Victorian Department of Agriculture. I received advice at 3.30 this afternoon from the Bureau of Animal Health that the Deputy Director of Agriculture in Victoria had advised that his Department had found no traces of any dyed beef in the 14OC cartons which currently are impounded and are being species tested. However, the Victorian Department has found some small traces of dyed horse meat in these cartons, and this matter is part of the current police investigation.

         —For a Budget to achieve its economic and social purpose, it has to do more than expound generalised theory and abstract statistics. It has to enlist the active co-operation of all Australians in an economic enterprise which is national in the true sense of the term, having meaning not simply for a government but for the community as a whole. There must, therefore, be a perceived and creative balance between restraint and opportunity, between taxation and reward, between sectional claims and fair play for all. Otherwise, there will be no widespread enthusiasm or effective opportunity for national economic growth and, as a result, no capacity to cater for real social need. A Budget should not become a scoreboard for winners and losers; rather, it should offer the chance for everyone to participate on a just and rewarding basis. To the degree that a Budget fails that challenge, it fails its own strategy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In future, I would prefer to see a Budget framed on the basis of its being as economically and socially productive as possible. By 'economically productive' I mean a Budget that encourages the kind of national economic growth which generates real wealth for the benefit of all Australians. By 'socially productive' I mean a Budget which caters for carefully identified areas of genuine human need and avoids a situation in which those who do not need government assistance are given help at the expense of those who do. If one wants to see a Budget in national housekeeping terms, there is no inherent value in coming out even at the end of the period if, in the meantime, some members of the family have been allowed to be gluttons at the expense of those who have been undernourished.
       </para>
       <para>
        A good Budget needs to be more than a balance of figures. It needs to promote balance in the process of growth itself, ensuring a sensitive adjustment between the challenge of economic productivity and the satisfaction of social need. A Budget has to be evaluated in terms of how well or how badly it meets these twin objectives: The objective of promoting broadly based and stable growth and expanding opportunities, and the objective of meeting genuine social need. I am talking here not just of broad aggregates-that is, whether certain monetary targets are met and the size of the Budget deficit or surplus, important though these are-I am talking also about how the Budget affects people-individuals and families-and about who is being asked to bear the burden for the Budget strategy, and why. It is not enough to see the Budget as a technical economic document. It has far reaching and very direct effects on every member of the community. Let me give some examples:
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, the Budget's tax policies have a direct impact on the attitudes to work and productivity that now permeate the whole of the Australian community. From these flow current attitudes to wage claims and industrial disputes as well as people's capacity to spend in the Australian economy and to generate a steady demand for goods and services. Secondly, budgetary and monetory policies determine the level of interest rates to be paid by millions of homeowners and those seeking to own a home. Thirdly, the Budget directly affects small businesses throughout the country and the cost structure of all business.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whatever their specific needs, all Australians are looking for a Budget which conveys a sufficiently broad national vision about the economic future of Australia. A constructive Budget will be fundamentally concerned with realising this country's economic potential. Unless we are effective in creating new wealth, we shall correspondingly be limited in our capacity to assist those in the community who really need government help. The direct link between productivity and welfare is one that Labor ignores. The Labor Party's policies emphasise the need for welfare without at the same time giving due recognition to the corresponding need to create the additional productivity to pay for this welfare. The need to foster additional productivity should be a central concern of any Budget strategy, and the possibility for balanced development should be a basic criterion against which we judge the national opportunities a Budget provides.
       </para>
       <para>
        There can be no doubt that the policies of this Government since 1975 have been instrumental in restoring the basic strength of the Australian economy, particularly relative to the rest of the world, and have laid the base for sound expansion through the remainder of the 1980s. The stated aim of this Budget is to strengthen the foundations laid in the last five years, and in particular to deal with the threat posed by the signs of re-emerging inflationary pressures over the last year. This is absolutely appropriate. To this end, the Budget aims to restrict monetary growth to 10 per cent to 11 per cent. It aims for a domestic surplus of $1.5 billion, despite a real growth in spending of 1.9 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1981 Budget must, however, be evaluated in the context of the total spectrum of the Government's economic policies. Firstly, monetary policy has been significantly tightened during 1981. Long term bond rates have risen from less than 12 per cent 12 months ago to their current level of 15 per cent; other interest rates have moved up to a similar degree. Secondly, the exchange rate has moved up by 8 per cent since January, which affects export and import competing industries. Thirdly, as a result of the Premiers Conference and Loan Council decisions, State Governments and their authorities have been forced to restrict their expenditure growth and loan raisings. Fourthly, in July, new health arrangements were announced, together with the half-indexation tax cut and the abandonment of tax indexation for the future. Fifthly, wage policies are in a state of uncertainty since indexation was abandoned by the Arbitration Commission, and sixthly, new directions are being assessed, and properly so, in tariff policy and other assistance to industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's stated objective is to cut back the size of the government sector to allow the deployment of resources into growth-generating private sector activities without adding to inflationary pressures. While I support this objective, I believe that with this Budget the Government is risking excessive contraction of the economy during 1982. In the Government's own words it expects an erosion of profit margins in 1981-82 that would more than offset the rise incurred in 1980-81. Private capital inflow is set to play an important role in financing new investment. If capital inflow falls below projected levels-and there are signs that this may be the case-the Government must not allow credit conditions to become excessively tight. We do not want a repetition of the credit crunch that Labor administered in 1974. We do not want any more sudden lurches in policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that Government economic policies allow for progressive improvement of the economy without excessive expansion or excessive contraction. An economically efficient and socially humane approach to management of the national economy involves smooth and timely changes of gear. Flexibility is, of course, essential but it should not be at the expense of the stability people hope to find in Liberal as opposed to Labor Party management. Not only businessmen but all Australians need to be able to rely on a degree of certainty and predictability in Liberal government policy-making. State governments would also appreciate some predictability and stability at the national level. As they assume greater responsibilities that were previously acknowledged by the Commonwealth Government, the States are looking for-and should receive-more room to move. In this context, while total Budget outlays are expected to increase by 12.6 per cent in 1981-82, direct outlays by the Commonwealth will increase by 15.1 per cent. By contrast, payments to the States will increase by only 8.2 per cent. This is despite a transfer of functions to the States and curtailment of their borrowing capacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the key elements of the Government's strategy is the containment of wage increases. I am not convinced, however, that the Government is going about it the right way. Since the abandonment of indexation there is no real wages policy. The Government appears to hope that if profits are squeezed business will do the job for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have said before that I believe the Government's objectives in the longer term should be to hand over to employers and employees greater responsibility for wage fixation, perhaps through a system of collective bargaining. But this cannot be done overnight. No country in the world has collective bargaining without an institutional or legislative framework. It must be introduced within a new framework of industrial law. The present system unquestionably needs a complete overhaul. While this is occurring there should be, firstly, a return to the disputes settlement role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and, secondly, a national wage case in which the Commission can adjust for the consumer price index on a retrospective basis, all those wages under federal awards which have not moved, or have moved less than, the amount determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the primary aim of this Budget is correct, the burden of its achievement will fall most heavily on those least able to afford it-such as young families wishing to purchase their first home and families with low earned incomes or statutory incomes. The average family has been faced in the past 12 months with increasing taxes and charges on all fronts-higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, higher health charges and now higher sales tax across the board with little or no compensating increase in real disposable income. To my mind the real disappointment of this Budget is that the Government hopes to achieve economic restraint not by reassessing its own spending, but by effectively increasing taxes levied by the Commonwealth at a time when State Governments will also, inevitably, be moving to impose higher taxes. Commonwealth Budget outlays will remain at around 28 per cent of gross domestic product in 1981-82, down only marginally from the peak of 30 per cent in 1975-76 and well above the 24 per cent level of the early 1970s. Outlays of all public authorities, which include government authorities outside the Budget and State Government spending, will be 38 per cent of GDP in 1981-82, the same level which prevailed when we assumed government in 1975.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the revenue side, the income tax burden on the individual has continued to grow. More importantly, it has fallen very unevenly on wage and salary earners paying pay-as-you-earn tax, to the benefit of those with the capacity and indeed the inclination to avoid tax. Individual income taxes have grown at an average rate of 19 per cent a year in the last ten years and they are now projected to grow a further 19 per cent in 1981-82. They now amount to just over half of all Budget receipts. PAYE taxes are expected to grow at 22 per cent in the coming year, compared with expected wage increases of 13 per cent. There can be no doubt of the damaging effects of the Government's growing dependence on personal income taxes. High taxes stifle incentive and encourage tax avoidance and tax evasion. It is hardly surprising that wage and salary earners seek to protect themselves through higher wage claims. Higher income taxes promote speculative investment for capital gains, and discourage productive, income producing investment. I endorse the Government's moves to close loopholes in the tax legislation and its commitment to examine the income tax treatment of small shareholders following the Campbell report.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, I support the objective of broadening the tax base by moving towards increasing reliance on indirect taxation, something which is much more difficult for the unscrupulous to avoid. However, the implementation of that objective has to be fair. I have reservations about the proposed sales tax increases, particularly because they have not been accompanied as was indicated previously that they would be-by genuine reductions in the burden of personal income taxes. The Government has promised tax relief and people expect it. Australians will make sacrifices when required to achieve reasonable longer term objectives. But they also expect a fair sharing of the burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I see it, the problem lies in the area of government expenditure. Despite promises to the contrary, real Commonwealth outlays have continued to grow. The fastest growing areas during the past decade have been education, health, and social security, all of which have achieved average annual rates of growth of over 20 per cent. On reflection we must surely question the extent to which this rising expenditure is economically and socially productive, and whether it meets genuine social need. So much of government spending goes to people who demonstrably do not need government assistance; that is, do not need an extra $76 a month from the Government to support three children, do not need a $3,000 grant from the government to buy their first home or who do not need the Government to pay one-third of the cost of their family's health insurance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me illustrate some of the expenditures involved: For example, firstly, in the social welfare area dependent spouse rebates, costing $578m in 1979-80, and family allowances, estimated to cost $1,040m in 1981-82, or over 11 per cent of total cash transfers, are given regardless of income.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this context, I am rather perplexed by the decision to limit increases in family allowances to families with three or more children. There are many large families with low income who will benefit, but the fact is that the majority of low income families have fewer than three children. Secondly, health insurance rebates, which will not be income related, are expected to cost $600m when they are introduced in 1982-83. Thirdly, a large part of the increase in housing spending-some $30m-will go into the Homes Savings Grant Scheme which provides generous benefits, regardless of income, at the expense of funding for the States for welfare housing. Fourthly, at the same time, the position of many statutory income recipients has worsened, for example and in particular, the young unemployed, because not all benefits are indexed for increases in the CPI. These people will be particularly hard hit by, for example, the sales tax increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have singled out these areas because they form a significant part of Government outlays. There are many other areas which would bear similar scrutiny. Expenditure on social security and welfare will be a key area of Government spending for the future. Already it amounts to $9.9 billion or around 27 per cent of total Budget outlays. The value of all pensions has increased and more people are taking up the age pension. Since 1970 the number of income support recipients has risen from 15 per cent of the working-age population to about 27 per cent. With an ageing population this ratio will move even higher. If the Commonwealth Government is to respond to this growing need and to protect the real incomes of those relying on it for support, without imposing an increasingly onerous taxation burden on the workforce, then a fundamental reassessment of the taxation welfare system is unquestionably required. I think we need to go back and re-examine the recommendations of the Henderson report. I am not pretending that there are any easy solutions. Needed decisions will demand a good deal of courage from Government leaders. I think a start could be made by making all assistance to families and individuals income-related. I am not overlooking the problems inherent in means testing, in particular the taxing of benefits at the margin, nor of the abuse the system receives from some. But I believe it should not be beyond the wit of man to come up with schemes more equitable than those we have at present.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion I believe the primary aim of this Budget-to prevent a resurgence of inflation-is undoubtedly correct. I support a firm monetary and fiscal policy. But the Government should be prepared to ease controls should credit conditions become too tight. My main concern is the means adopted to achieve the objective of restraint. Families have been hit with higher government taxes and charges, small business and sections of industry have been hit, State governments have been squeezed, while Commonwealth spending continues to increase. The Government needs to reassess its approach to spending, concentrating on the areas of genuine need, cutting out expenditure to those who do not need assistance, and thereby enabling the genuine cuts in personal income tax that this Government has so long promised. The essence of our budgetary strategy should be the opening up of opportunities. A vision of growth-balanced growth-must motivate the drafting of a creative national Budget.

         —It is a tragedy that many of the matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) were not heard by so many honourable members who sit opposite. This year's Federal Budget characterises the Fraser Government. It is a disaster for Australia. It is a document riddled with meanness and elitism. The Budget continues the regressive distribution of wealth in this country which is the hallmark of the Fraser Government. There is nothing in this Budget for the vast majority of families except higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates and higher unemployment. The rhetoric by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget Speech is typical of the duplicity of this Government. For example, while saying 'It is vital to the nation's interests that there be no acceleration in the inflation rate in 1981-82', two Government decisions, the decision on sales tax and the earlier decision on health insurance arrangements, will add at least 1 1/2 per cent to the cost of living. All Government members are as guilty of duplicity as the Treasurer is guilty. But one of the most blatant examples comes from the inept Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh). In the document entitled, 'Department of Housing and Construction, Notes for the 1981-82 Budget Debate-Housing and Construction Activities', the Minister stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The broad objectives of the Commonwealth Government's housing policies are (inter alia):
       </para>
       <para>
        to ensure that every family in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is absolute nonsense. The Minister is ignorant of, or is ignoring, the facts. The independent report by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation found that housing is now out of the reach of 50 per cent of families because of high interest rates. The sales tax on building materials will add at least $500 to the price of a new home, taking it further out of the reach of most families. The fact that this Budget makes yet another increase in interest rates inevitable demonstrates the total failure of this Government in the area of housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at some independent views on this issue. In April this year, before the latest interest rates increase, the managing director of Jennings Industries Ltd, Mr J. J. Wood, said housing activity would slow substantially in Australia if mortgage interest remained above 12 per cent. Now the Government has forced even savings bank mortgage interest to over 12 per cent and building society interest to a record 14.75 per cent. In an article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of 7 April this year, Mr Wood said that in looking at what was an affordable interest rate on mortgages, a number of key factors had to be kept in mind. Some of the factors mentioned by Mr Wood were these: Half of all employees in Australia earn less than $200 a week; the normal maximum term of a housing loan is 30 years; and an increase of one per cent in interest rates reduces borrowing power by around $2,500 for a family which can afford mortgage payments of $100 a week. Mr Wood said further that to sustain a weekly repayment of around $100 on a $30,000 house and land package, purchased on a 10 per cent deposit, a young couple would require a gross weekly income of around $350.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Bankers Association Research Directorate on 3 September 1981 disclosed that the value of housing loans from banks grew by 5.2 per cent over 1980-81 and from building societies by 2 per cent, while the value of loans from finance companies grew by 44.3 per cent. This was a massive increase on the 7.7 per cent growth for finance companies in 1979-80. The consequence of loans from finance companies growing at this rate at exorbitant rates of interest is horrifying and is another matter which the Minister has ignored. This issue is of grave concern to all Australians, particularly those in the electorate that I represent where many families are being forced out of their homes as a result of mortgage repayments. So much for the statement by the Minister that the Government's policy is to ensure that every family in Australia is able to obtain adequate housing within its capacity to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        A study conducted for a Melbourne family care organisation and produced by the department of social work at Monash University, based on 1976 statistics, found that the four municipalities of Berwick, Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sherbrooke:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . have a high proportion of young families who are in the process of buying their own home. Mortgages tend to be higher than average and hence suggest that financial liabilities and stress might be suffered by many prospective home buyers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a fact that stress is being suffered by so many of these home buyers. In this rapidly developing area people are leaving their homes or are suffering under unbearable loan repayments. They will not be satisfied or placated by the bland assertions of the Minister. These people desperately need help. But again, the Minister has failed to act in the interests of the majority who will continue to suffer under this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nowhere in the Budget is the cynical and inhumane attitude of this Government more obvious than in youth unemployment. The Treasurer acknowledges that the level of unemployment will increase but at the same time he makes the decision to terminate the Community Youth Support Scheme. The 50,000 young people who depend on the Scheme for support are now faced with despair as a result of that cruel Government decision. The young unemployed are faced with desperate financial and psychological problems caused by the Government's failure to provide an adequate unemployment benefit and its obsessive rejection of job creation programs. Through the Community Youth Support Scheme the Government was providing valuable assistance for the young unemployed. Dedicated project officers have provided essential support and advice. In addition, there is the support that the young unemployed have given one another.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many of the projects operated under the Scheme have achieved true community support. It has come from voluntary workers committees and generous help has been provided by service clubs. Of course, those factors would not appeal to this Government. The Community Youth Support Scheme was working to educate the community about the real problems of unemployment. In areas in which Community Youth Support Scheme projects were working with community involvement it was difficult to hide or distort the problem by blaming the victims, which has been a favourite pastime of this Government. People were starting to realise the appalling situation of the young unemployed. I have no doubt that that awareness, created to a large extent by the Community Youth Support Scheme, was a major reason for the decision to axe the Scheme. The alternatives proposed by this Government will not help the long term unemployed. The Treasurer claims that new programs are more attuned to labour market conditions. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) in a Press release dated 30 August claimed:
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time when the economy is growing and with it employment opportunities for the young, the Government considers that the most practical way of helping young people is to provide increased education, training and work experience opportunities. In that way they will be able to improve their skills and better compete in the growing labour market.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister further stated that circumstances had changed greatly since the Community Youth Support Scheme was introduced in 1976. For a change, that statement certainly is true, as between August 1976 and February 1981 the number of young unemployed in receipt of the unemployment benefit increased by 86,858, a massive increase of 80 per cent over a period of 4 1/2 years. What absolute nonsense to talk about the growing labour market!
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government continues to attempt to sell that nonsense by fiddling the figures, using Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment figures and refusing to collect Commonwealth Employment Service statistics because those statistics give a true analysis on a regional basis of the number of registered unemployed and the number of jobs available. However, the facts on unemployment are still revealed by statistics available through the Department of Social Security. Those statistics show that in August 1976 the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit was 190,632. By February 1981, the latest date for which figures are available, the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit was 332,560, which represents an increase of 141,928. An analysis of those figures for the young unemployed shows that in August 1976 107,092 of those people in receipt of the unemployment benefit were aged under 25 years. By February 1981 that figure had increased by 86,858 to 193,950, representing a percentage increase of 80 per cent in 4 1/2 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet the Treasurer talks about programs more attuned to labour market conditions and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs compounds that ridiculous assertion by talking about a growing labour market. The facts are that the Community Youth Support Scheme provides assistance for at least 50,000 young unemployed. An analysis of the Budget statements covering the so-called alternative programs indicates clearly that those programs will provide not more than 20,000 positions in training in addition to those for 1980-81, leaving 30,000 young people still unemployed, not in training and left to rot by this Government. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs places great emphasis on skills training to provide assistance to overcome specific skills shortages and to train unemployed persons towards employment in occupations in demand. Yet Budget Paper No. 1 shows at page 176 that funds for skills in demand will allow for 11,000 on-the-job and 1,100 formal training approvals in 1980-81, compared with 15,600 and 1,900 approvals in 1980-81, a decrease of 5,400 positions. That information is taken from the Budget Papers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, we keep coming back to the problem of the 30,000 young people who are not catered for in any alternative scheme. That figure is a conservative estimate, as many young people currently unemployed are not participating in Community Youth Support Scheme projects and will not be catered for in the new programs. For those young people the Government proposes one scheme, namely, the Community Youth Special Project, which will receive a miserable allocation of $340,000. That would finance about 10 projects of a nature similar to that of programs under the present Community Youth Support Scheme, which covers about 275 projects and gives support to 50,000 young unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs really believe that young people suffering from depression, loneliness and frustration from long term unemployment will be suddenly integrated into a work force which has rejected them for such a long period? As clearly indicated, when not enough jobs are available, finding employment will be very difficult for people who obtain skills through training, but it will be absolutely impossible for so many young unemployed who are unable to cope with skilled training. I doubt that even the Minister is so stupid that he cannot see that, but he and this Government have decided to ignore those young people. The work experience and training schemes proposed by the Government will fail. Despite persistent claims to the contrary, there are not enough jobs available and there is no job creation element in any of the schemes. They are elitist to the extent that preference will be given to suitable unemployed persons, whatever that may mean. One thing is certain and that is that it will not apply to many of the long term unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much has been written and said about the psychological effects of continued rejection for employment. That position will be far worse when young people are rejected not only for employment but also for job training or for any support scheme. Since 1976 those young people have had real support through the Community Youth Support Scheme. The Government has now taken away the only real backup provided for the young unemployed. The tragic realities of prolonged unemployment include increases in suicide rates, alcoholism, drug abuse, violence and crime. One of the few studies on this matter was conducted by Doreen Parsons of the Department of Psychology at the Swinburne College of Technology. The report on that study states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Whatever the aims of the Government are and whatever else it's doing or not doing about the unemployment problem, it appears that while young people are unemployed the C.Y.S.S. groups provide an alternative to hanging around and reduce the incidence of offending which could be increasing due to the effect of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        How worse the situation will become now. Experience in England should be a stark lesson for this Government but honourable members opposite are very slow learners. It must be said that when all the problems manifest themselves the blame will and should be placed on this Government, which, on this issue, has reached the depths of political depravity. The response of people associated with the various projects has been predictable. Their first reaction was one of shock, which was followed by deep resentment against a government which had deceived them. Deceive them the Government did. In September 1980 the then Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner), paraded around Dandenong mouthing soothing utterances for people associated with the Community Youth Support Scheme. His visit was reported in the Dandenong Journal of 10 September. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister told other group leaders that funds for the CYSS had been increased in the Budget by $1.6m. Mr Viner said the increase would allow full retention of the 275 projects currently being undertaken in Australia, and enable funding of up to ten new ones. Mr Viner said there was strong community support and involvement with CYSS operating in the district.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, at that time the Government was facing an election. We all know about the record of this Government in sticking to what it says at election time. Not to be outdone, the new Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs was most emphatic about future funding for the scheme. In an article in the Advertiser on 2 June 1981 he announced that youth support schemes need not fear coming changes to funding operations. How can we be expected to rely on or even take seriously any future statements by this Minister? In taking the decision the Government did not bother to evaluate what was done by the projects and the benefits to the participants. It must be condemned for its failure to consult with those involved at all levels of the CYSS projects. A classic example is the Peninsula Unemployment Assistance Board, a Community Youth Support Scheme project in Frankston. This project moved to new premises about six weeks ago. The premises were opened by Mr Weideman, the Victorian Minister for Tourism, acting on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) who at the time was overseas. This opening took place on 14 August to be followed by the now infamous decision to terminate funding on 18 August.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has acted blindly without even attempting to understand the consequences of the actions taken by the Government. There was no research or justification. In fact, the last evaluation of the Community Youth Support Scheme was carried out by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs in 1977. That report concluded that the projects were a success and were providing essential assistance and support to the young unemployed. The Minister's performance on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program PM on 20 August was pathetic. Commenting on a demonstration by the young unemployed he said: 'I'd ask them to go home, to use the Commonwealth Employment Service where there are jobs available under our training schemes, or do some other course, one of the many courses or programs we have got so that they can get the skills and experience they need to get a job.' In the first place, many young unemployed do not have a home to go to. Obviously, the tragedy of youth homelessness is another issue which the Minister prefers to ignore. He adopts the same attitude to job vacancies.

        It is not too late for the Government to reverse this appalling decision. There is a domestic surplus of $1,542m in this Budget, yet these mean, miserable people have refused to allow the expenditure of a meagre $14m for our young unemployed. Surely the Government should show some compassion. If the Government fails to reverse this decision it must bear the full responsibility for its action. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has engaged in a vicious deception of those involved in the Community Youth Support Scheme. The failure of the Goverment to evaluate or even attempt to understand the consequences of its actions is appalling.

        —At Question Time today I asked a question of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in relation to Protean (Holdings) Ltd and its subsidiaries. Of course, the question related to meat exports. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) took a point of order and said that there was confusion on my part and that the company which had been suspended was called Profreeze; allegations about the substitution of horse meat had been made against it, not against Protean (Holdings) Ltd. I wish to get the record straight. I asked a question concerning export expansion grants and export market development grants to Protean (Holdings) Ltd and its subsidiaries. The Minister for Primary industry took the point of order to which I have referred. I have checked some of the records which are available. On 2 September Samsons Meat Co. (Victoria) Pty Ltd lost its licence over evidence of horse meat being included in meat for which it was responsible for exporting. On 3 September Mr Leslie J. Harrison, company secretary of Samsons Meat was interviewed on the program AM. I will quote a short extract of the transcript. It reads:

       On the basis of that evidence the substance of my question stands. It is verified by the record. In two places in the question I referred to Protean (Holdings) Ltd and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary, Samsons Meat Co. (Victoria) Pty Ltd, certainly had its licence suspended in relation to the meat scandal.

         —In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 I am sure that most honourable members who were listening to the speech by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) could not fail to be impressed with some of the points he raised. I was going to reiterate the need for a definite shift in the whole form of the collection of taxation in Australia in coming years. He pointed the finger at the very real need for a review of the tax collecting techniques in this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The comments he made regarding the provision of social services to the people of Australia were also very telling. When we look through the Budget Papers and see that social security payments are such an incredibly high percentage of our national outlays we can obviously see that there is a very real need to overhaul these payments. The allocation of social security payments on a needs basis rather than under the free for all system that seems to operate in Australia now is something that needs very close attention. It is true that there are many recipients of social security payments in Australia who, quite frankly, do not need to have that sort of money. Many large families who will benefit quite substantially from the increase in family allowances, frankly, have no need for that extra cash. If we do nothing else in the next 12 months an exercise that could be undertaken to make sure that social security payments go to the areas of most need would certainly be well worth our while. It would be well worth a review in order to reach the objective of cutting government expenditure and making our social security payments more telling than they are at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, the Government is looking towards a shift in the collection of taxes. We have seen in this Budget for the first time the implementation of a broader spectrum of sales taxes. I acknowledge that this measure is not without its problems. Some people in our community will be affected in a very real way by these changes in taxation. But I am sure that we can see exactly where they will lead us. There will be a shift in the collection of taxes. We will move more and more towards sales taxes. Obviously, if we have a Budget surplus there will be room to move in future months to provide some sort of personal income tax relief. That, I believe, is the desire of every honourable member on the Government side of the House. There is a very real acknowledgment that there must be a form of income tax relief if we are to allow people to reach their full maturity and govern their own lives to a very great extent. That philosophy comes through to me in very strong terms in the Budget Papers that have been delivered to this House.
       </para>
       <para>
        I express some concern at the way in which some aspects of the sales tax measures have been implemented. I was interested earlier in the day to hear matters raised in the House by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). They spoke of the effect that the sales tax measures will have on the boat building industry. My electorate joins that of the honourable member for Griffith. It is quite easy for us to see the very real effects in those electorates. It is true that by virtue of the allowances made by the Government last year there has been somewhat of a boom in boat building in Australia. It is true that some unscrupulous people have claimed that they are buying charter vessels, have applied for the 27 1/2 per cent reduction but perhaps will not use those vessels for completely legitimate purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect on the boat building industry throughout Australia, especially in Queensland, will be rather drastic. The fact that the extra 2 1/2 per cent sales tax has been put on boat building, which was previously exempt, means that most of the boats being built today will attract a sales tax rate of about 17 1/2 per cent. The effect has already been seen in Brisbane. In one shipyard alone two contracts worth $2.5m each have been cancelled in the last week. Another contract worth $3m in another yard is now in jeopardy, and two boat building yards are already threatening to close down. Obviously the full effect of the implementation of the sales tax is not going to be seen, but people who have already put in a legitimate order need some room to move to get some sort of exemption from this sales tax slug. That is not to say that I am against the prospect of having a broad-based tax in the form of sales tax across the whole spectrum. For reasons that have already been propounded in the House this afternoon, I believe it is a fairer form of taxation. It is a means by which people who tend to avoid tax can be caught up. It is a tax which is paid as one spends. Obviously many people are going to pay a fairer amount of tax than perhaps they are now paying by virtue of the broad-based nature of the tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation of the boat building industry in Brisbane is serious. Directly hundreds of jobs are in the balance and indirectly, if we take the situation to the nth degree, quite a number of sections of the community will be very badly affected. I sincerely hope that the appeals being made by various honourable members in this House will reach the ears of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) so that something may be done in the short term to overcome this problem. There is no doubt, as was mentioned previously in the House, that a very real boom is happening in the tourist industry in Australia. Part of that tourist industry is the operation of launches, pleasure boats and cruise boats, especially in the waters of Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have spoken on a number of occasions in the House on the effect of tourism in Australia over the last few years. As I have just mentioned, the boating industry is a very real contributor to that industry. However, some speeches made in this House in the last couple of weeks, following the announcement of the Budget provisions, have worried me. There would seem to be abroad in the community a fear that the tourist industry will be adversely affected by some of the moves that have been made in the Budget. Obviously I would reject some of those implications. In a speech earlier this session, dealing with the increase in departure tax, it was suggested that there should be a different method of collecting departure tax. it has been interesting to see the reaction from the industry in the last few weeks. Telegrams have been received saying that the $20 departure tax applied to people leaving Australia is one of the highest in the world. In fact, in terms of its direct method of collection, it is the highest. I sincerely hope that the appeals to the appropriate Minister asking that there be reconsideration of the collection of departure tax will be heeded. It still seems to me to be a rather silly system of collecting departure tax to employ people to sit in airports around Australia to take in the money when we know that the collection procedures cost in excess of $880,000 a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us really look at where tourism is headed in Australia. There is no doubt that it is a giant. It is almost like a volcano ready to explode. We are reaping the benefits of what tourism can provide-more than $1 billion spent on tourism this year in this country and one million visitors expected to come to this country this year, both of those factors contributing to employment. It was pointed out in a speech last night that in Queensland alone some 3,500 new jobs were created in the industry in the past 12 months. I do not really think many honourable members in this House realise the enormity of the industry. It is huge. It is as big as the motor vehicle industry in Australia and, in terms of the income it provides, it is almost as big as the mining industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at the provisions made by government for the tourist industry, I suppose we can be thankful for small mercies. There have been rather major increases, but when we look at the protection, assistance and depreciation allowances provided to the motor vehicle and mining industries we really wonder just how much recognition there is of tourism and of what it is providing for Australia. Estimates show that between 2,000 million and 5,000 million people will be touring the world by the turn of the century. Australia obviously can have a very real part of the wealth and benefits that those people will provide. In Australia in the next five years between $5,000m and $7,000m will be invested in travel-related facilities. I suppose that really is an indication of just how huge the industry is.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose the question we should all be asking is: How much of that money will be wasted in Australia because it will be applied in the wrong places at the wrong time? The growth in the number of Australians holidaying overseas is slowing down and by far the majority of Australians-about 80 per cent-will be holidaying in Australia this year. As I said, we hope to have one million overseas visitors coming to this country this year and between 1.5 million and 2 million by the year 1985. Provided strikes do not scare them away, that will mean a very real increase in employment in this country. If we look round the industry in Australia at the moment we can see that 20 first-class hotels are under construction in our major cities. They are going to attract a great deal of the business traffic over the next few years.
       </para>
       <para>
        When looking at some of the very real tourist attractions in Australia, I wonder just what provisions are being made for some decent accommodation in those areas. For instance, touring by car and coach in the Northern Territory is very popular but there has been very little development of hotels and motels on the Darwin to Alice Springs stretch. In places such as the Kakadu National Park, the attraction of which to visitors is almost unlimited, we are providing virtually nothing at all. It is true that not all holidaymakers want to take their tents and go camping. We really must take stock of the development that is happening in Australian tourism to make sure that we have the right infrastructure to handle the incredible increase not only in the number of visitors coming to this country but also in the number of Australians touring around it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has already made some quite generous gestures to the industry by providing export market development schemes. We have seen increases in the amount of money spent on the promotion of internal tourism in Australia and some massive increases in the amount of money spent overseas. In the overseas offices of the Australian Tourist Commission at the moment we employ 29 staff, out of a total staff of about 76 on the Australian Tourist Commission. One could ask: Should the Government be providing all that infrastructure for promotion of Australia overseas? I suppose that really the answer is no, that the Government in many respects has taken the lead in getting tourism off the decks overseas but that now we must really look to the Australian tourist industry to start providing some of the leadership which is obviously so necessary and which will be required so much in the years to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is one area that worries me because there are a number of industry organisations that we in this House virtually never hear of. I suppose that the Australian Federation of Travel Agents would be the most effective tourist-related body. In fact I believe it is coming to Canberra next week for its annual meeting and to meet with Government and Opposition members to let them know what is happening in its part of the industry. But the rest of the industry is still fairly scattered. It is a conglomerate of a great number of areas and, as yet, these different factions have been unable to get together to provide a really united industry voice. While I will always preach in this House the gospel of tourism and the benefits it can provide, it really is about time that we looked to the industry itself to provide some of the leadership and some of the plans that will be necessary during the next decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        The plain facts are that Australian tourism does not really know where it is going. I do not think it is necessarily up to the Government to provide leadership forever. It is about time that a number of tourist organisations started telling the Government in which direction the industry should go. If nothing further happens in the next 12 months, I am not quite sure where we will be and whether or not we will be able to handle the tremendous tourist boom that is starting in Australia. I appeal to all sections of the tourist industry to get together, to unite, and to start working out a very real tourist plan so that we can take advantage of the employment prospects, and indeed the money, that will be provided by visiting tourists and by Australians travelling around their own country. We must have an industry that is prepared to contribute towards its own well-being. More and more we should see governments-Federal, State and local-pulling out of the whole business of tourist promotion and making sure that the industry is prepared to support itself. With the work the Government has done over the last four years, the infrastructure is probably there now. We have created a situation in which the industry can boom. It is up to the industry to take very great advantage of the situation we have created.
       </para>
       <para>
        Referring to the cessation of the Community Youth Support Scheme, which has been mentioned this afternoon, there is no doubt that a lot of feeling exists within the community that the CYSS provided a very real service to the young unemployed. I do not think there is any doubt that some CYSS schemes were not as effective as others. I suppose every Federal member could stand up in this House and tell the world that the schemes in his area were ideal, and served a very real purpose and there was nothing wrong with them. I would join that group in relation to one of the schemes in my electorate, but I am the first to admit that we closed down a second scheme because it was not really reaching the needs of the people. The people about whom I am most concerned, and I sincerely hope that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) will come forward with a scheme, are those who could be loosely described as unemployable, and there are large numbers of them in our community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The retraining programs, which will provide 90,000 positions during the next 12 months, are to be commended. I believe they have quite a lot going for them. Nevertheless, in the next six weeks or so some scheme must be provided-I think we can do it now with a lot of community support-to make sure that those people who may not fit into the training schemes, who could be loosely described as unemployable, are not thrown out on the streets. We must make some very real provision for their welfare in the coming months. No doubt a lot more criticism will be heaped on the Government, but I think it will be some time before the full ramifications of the closure of the CYSS scheme around Australia are realised and we have a real indication of just how many people must be picked up in some other scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I close by paying a very high tribute to the people who have been involved in the CYSS schemes, to the local committees and the project officers who were prepared to do a real job. They have made a contribution, and I do not believe that that contribution will be fully lost. I believe that they can still make a contribution by providing some alternative that will pick up and provide facilities for those young people who may be displaced from the new retraining schemes.

         —The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) had the temerity to say what a good job the Community Youth Support Scheme had done. At the same time he applauded its closure. No comfort is offered to the families of Hotham in the sixth Fraser Budget. Very few families in my electorate will gain from increased family assistance for the third, fourth and fifth child as the Government will take this away with increased taxes on shoes, clothing, school books, stationery and school requisites. In fact, there will be increased sales tax on every item that a family needs. The sixth Fraser Budget, like the previous five, is calculated to reduce family living standards and to increase unemployment. It is a long-standing belief of this Government that by increasing unemployment it can reduce inflation. It has certainly managed to increase unemployment to a record level since it grabbed power in 1975. At the same time, inflation is still high. As a matter of fact inflation is again on the increase and is likely to reach 12 per cent.
        </para>

       <para>
        As I said at the outset, this Budget has nothing to offer the people in my electorate. It has nothing to offer pensioners, wage and salary earners, the sick or the healthy. The sixth Fraser Budget-I am sure we cannot afford many more-will harm most people. Income tax paid by wage and salary earners will be at a record level of $21,000m. If that is compared with the $5,000m paid by companies, honourable members will come to the conclusion that in this country, under this Government, the poor and the employed pay taxes while the rich please themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many people use every loophole to avoid paying taxes. The big foreign companies use transfer pricing and other methods to cook their books. Family trusts and other perks are available to the rich, while the rest of the community is taxed more and more every year by this Government to make up for the tax avoiders. Income tax collected from wage and salary earners will rise by 22 per cent. The Fraser Government has abandoned tax indexation, despite its election promises. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) pledged to bring in tax indexation 'to keep the Government honest'. We all know the value of the Prime Minister's promises. As recently as 31 August, in his weekly electorate broadcast Mr Fraser stated in relation to health insurance:
       </para>
       <para>
        The new arrangements reflect the Commonwealth Government's commitment to small government. This is important if people are to be free to decide how they will spend their money rather than having the Government take the decisions for them through heavier taxation burdens.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a hypocrite! The Prime Minister has the temerity to say that people should be free to decide what to do with their money after he has made damn sure, through this Budget, that most people have no money left to decide what to do with. There is no doubt about it, this is the highest taxing Government in our history. It even wanted to tax the Bible. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) had to issue a Press statement three days after the Budget saying that he did not intend it to do this. It is a lean consolation to people, after being taxed on school books, to find that they can still buy a new prayer book exempt from tax. At least we can still pray that this Government will be thrown out of office so that Australia can prosper. Members of the Liberal Party of Australia did not mention in their election campaign last October that only 10 months later they would introduce sales tax on scores of new items and increase the existing tax significantly. They did not seek, nor did they get, a mandate from the Australian people for the imposition of such an unjust and inequitable tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party will oppose this new burden placed on Australian families. Those who canvassed the people's votes under false pretences 'to keep the bastards honest' went to water at the first test. No amount of rationalisation by the Australian Democrats about their duplicity will lessen the voters' feeling that they have been short changed. People who do not keep their promises will not keep any bastard honest, least of all the big bastard.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for his language. When we add together the income tax and sales tax slug, the petrol tax, the compulsory health insurance with increased rates and the increase in home loan interest rates, which at present are at the record level of 15 per cent, we understand the predicament of the ordinary Australian families that I represent. The latest round of home loan interest rate rises caused by the policies of the Fraser Government will prevent most young people from acquiring new homes and will force many householders to sell their homes as they will not be able to afford the high repayments. When this Budget was formulated by the Treasurer it was based on an optimistic assumption that our economic situation is approving. However, our economy is now in decline and this contractionary Budget will damage it further. Besides the threat to our living standards by this Budget there is an even more sinister move to endanger the livelihood of the people of Australia. Moves are afoot by the Fraser-Anthony Government to open the flood gates to foreign imports and to dismantle our manufacturing industry. Unless this Government is stopped, it will add hundreds of thousands of unemployed to those already out of work by lowering the protection of our industries. In my first speech in this House last year I warned that this Government intends to abandon our manufacturing sector. In that speech, on 4 December 1980, I stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This Government is culpable for allowing the unbridled exploitation of our resources by foreign interests and for neglecting to protect our manufacturing industry . . . The Government has bowed to transnational companies whose plan is to turn this continent into their quarry and to supply raw material and energy resources for their investment in cheap-labour Asian countries. There is no room in their master plan for Australia's manufacturing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since my first speech it is becoming more and more obvious that it is the intention of this Government to abandon our manufacturing industry. Only recently both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) were advocating tariff reductions. Also, the Industries Assistance Commission is recommending in its draft report the halving of tariffs, the abandonment of import quotas and an 85 per cent local content requirement for the vehicle industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I represent an electorate that has more than 1,800 industrial undertakings, mainly small industry, owned and managed by Australians. Many of these undertakings are manufacturers of automotive parts that are threatened by the IAC draft report. I have visited a number of these industries that employ, directly or indirectly, thousands of people from my electorate. During the last few weeks I have spoken to hundreds of workers, technicians and managers. They all agree that if the draft report is accepted by the Government our motor vehicle and components industry will be killed by foreign imports. By foreign imports I mean mainly those from Japanese makers, who have not only made heavy inroads into our markets but also are threatening local producers in both Europe and the United States of America. Many countries have had bitter experience with Japanese competition and are now protecting their local manufacturers to save their industry. We all know from experience that prices will not be cheaper because of such competition. Once our industries are dismantled and our jobs lost, the foreign car makers will screw as much as they can from the Australian public. They will be in a monopoly position and we will be at their mercy. I remind the House that Japanese businessmen are not known to be charitable. I am not alone in forecasting what will happen to our motor industry. Let me quote from the submission by General Motors-Holden's Ltd to the IAC inquiry. It reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        If the I.A.C.'s draft recommendations were implemented, G.M.H. would take the necessary decisions to concentrate totally on completely built unit imports. This would result in:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The cessation of future investments and ultimately the dismantling of our existing facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. A reduction in G.M.H.'s total employment from the current level of about 17,500 to less than 1,000. Under C.B.U. imports and no change in the level of market, employment in vehicle distribution will not increase. With market growth, any increase in distribution employment would not be commensurate with the reduction in manufacturing employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. A massive reduction in our business with local original equipment components producers and raw material suppliers. As about 60 per cent of our expenditures are payments to suppliers for materials, components and services, there would be a substantial rundown of production and employment in the local components manufacturing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the effects on our business and our suppliers, we believe that the implementation of the I.A.C.'s draft recomendations would lead to a rapid decline and the likely cessation of components manufacture and automobile assembly in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question at issue is: Does Australia want a motor vehicle manufacturing industry?
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt in my mind that Australians want to maintain their motor industry. The question is whether the Fraser-Anthony Government wants one. I have often been asked by workers why the Government would sacrifice the motor industry that took us over 30 years to build, that has so many million dollars of our investment and that employs so many of our workers. The answer to this question is not so difficult if we take into account the fact that foreign capital, exploiting and exporting our mineral resources, is exerting pressure on the Government to increase and facilitate the importation of manufactured products to balance the export of our raw materials and energy resources. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that such a proposal is bad business for Australia. Of course, in addition, knowing that the coffers of the coalition parties are filled by the mining companies' donations, the Government's desire to oblige is understandable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Added to this, the pressures of export oriented big grazing wool and wheat interests certainly convince our National Country Party members. They do not care for the families of city workers, nor do they care about electorally unpopular measures. They are not elected by popular vote. Their re-election is ensured by the gerrymander of the electorate. The same goes for types such as Mr Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland and Sir Charles Court in Western Australia. The Liberal partners, on the other hand, who have to face the consequences of their unpopular decisions, are powerless to resist the pressures as the National Country Party dominates the decision making. Only last session it was revealed to us by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), that the Co-ordination Committee, dominated by the Prime Minister and his powerful National Country Party colleagues, is superimposed over the Cabinet. It is very much the case of the National Country Party tailwagging the Liberal dog. The Deputy Prime Minister complained in a recent speech that too much noise is made about the tariff debate. He is surprised that the people working in the motor industry are fighting to retain their jobs. I wonder how loudly he would squeal if his farm were being taken away from him.

         —The free marketeers of the Liberal Party are also squealing-not like pigs. They attacked the joint advertisement of General Motors-Holden and the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia. They are unhappy to see labour and capital on the same side. They accused the industry of misleading advertising. I ask: Who are they to object to misleading advertisements? Do they not remember the election advertising of their own party last October? The Liberal Party's election advertisement was a blatant example of misleading advertising if ever there was one. Do the pious members opposite, who pontificate about the GMH advertisement, not remember their own party's election advertisement in 1977 showing the fist with the $5 notes? We have never seen those five dollar bills which were promised by the Liberal Party but the Liberal Party's hand is still around digging deep into the workers' pay packets. I can assure honourable members opposite that the people working in the motor industry will not remain silent. I emphasise that this time, on this issue, labour and capital, workers and management, are united. They are mounting a strong campaign to defend their industry and, with it, their jobs. They are bitter about the IAC draft report, bitter to the extent that they call the Industries Assistance Commission the 'Industries Assassination Commission'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I also make the point that even without a reduction of tariffs imports into Australia are becoming cheaper as our dollar appreciates. As yet we have not received any benefit. The importers have not reduced their prices as their intention is to squeeze every dollar that they can out of Australian consumers. At a time when most countries are protecting their motor industries there is a great danger that the Fraser Government may reduce the level of protection to our industries in general and to the motor industry in particular. Such moves not only would endanger the jobs of tens of thousands of Australian workers but also would result in loss of skills and weaken greatly our defence capacity. If this is the price that we have to pay for our so-called mineral resources boom then this nation might as well be without it.

        As I said previously, I have visited several automotive parts manufacturing plants in my electorate. I have seen the resolution of the workers and the managers to defend their industry. They are sending thousands of letters to their local members stating:

       <para>
        'I am concerned that I might lose my job in the Australian automotive parts industry. I want you to ask the Government to adopt policies that will keep the Australian motor industry strong and viable, safeguard job opportunities for Australians and encourage new investment in the industry. Please take Australia's part and help save my job.'
       </para>
       <para>
        I strongly support the campaign to save their jobs. I wish to deliver the letters written by scores of my constituents to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), who is at the table, so that he can inform his colleagues, the Government members, who are absent from the chamber most of the time, that the workers and the management of the Australian automotive parts manufacturing industry request that the IAC report be rejected. Now I have the pleasure to take the thousands of letters written by workers in my electorate and give them to the Minister.

         —The Budget brought down by this Government on 18 August gives high priority to containing and reducing inflation and at the same time sustaining private sector growth. The year 1980-81 was a year of achievement for the Australian economy. When we examine the figures for the June quarter of 1981 we find that excellent results have been achieved. The consumer price index increased by 2.2 per cent in the June quarter and by 8.8 per cent over the year. This must surely be one of the best records in the Western world in containing the inflation rate. Consumer spending rose strongly for 12 months-the 14 per cent increase far exceeding the increase in the CPI. Private dwelling approvals increased by 9.4 per cent in 1980-81. Employment rose by 2.3 per cent over the year. Unemployment fell from 5.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent in 1981. Motor vehicle registrations increased in 1980-81 by 4.5 per cent. This was the greatest increase in motor vehicle registrations for some considerable time. Any fair-minded person, irrespective of politics, must surely applaud that excellent performance. Evidence of the strong economic situation can be gauged by the fact that overseas countries, such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom and West Germany, are prepared to invest millions of dollars in this country in resources and agricultural. Indeed, as one travels around the countryside in New South Wales this is very evident.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Budget provides for the expenditure of $40,862m-an increase of 12.6 per cent over the previous year. Priority is given to social security payments, payments to the States, defence and foreign aid. The defence provision of $4,112m represents an increase of 16.3 per cent in current prices or 5.3 per cent in real terms. Social security expenditure is $11,357m, an increase of 14.5 per cent. Who states that this Government is not a compassionate government when the social security field takes a major share of the Budget funds?
       </para>
       <para>
        The speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) supported deficit budgeting and took us back to the Whitlam era, when irresponsible spending produced a deficit of $4 billion and inflation was running at the rate of 17 per cent. In the Australian Labor Party's last Budget expenditure rose from $16 billion to $22 billion, the greatest percentage increase in the history of Australian Federal politics. No wonder the people of Australia rejected the Whitlam Labor Government at the polls. Its efforts to balance the Budget by borrowing $4 billion from outside the normal financial system were disastrous. We have heard in the past few weeks about that gentleman, Khemlani-an Arab sitting in a dingy office in London-getting into financial problems in the United States and in other countries. This is the character from whom the Whitlam Government was trying to borrow $4 billion instead of going through normal banking channels. The present Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer in the Labor Government. After listening to his speech in the Budget debate in this House I feel that his policy and that of the Opposition has not changed.

        I repeat: Deficit budgeting as recommended by him is the last thing that Australia needs. It would be disastrous and would ruin the great efforts made by the Fraser-Anthony Administration to bring back sound economic measures which have achieved excellent results. It has taken five years to bring back sound conditions and restore confidence to the people of Australia and to our overseas trading partners. This is extremely important. Australia does not want socialism as espoused by the Leader of the Opposition. I feel sure that the public does not want it either. The public wants good, solid and sound administration, of the economy. The Fraser-Anthony Government is giving them that.

        Australia is on the verge of tremendous resource development in coal, liquefied petroleum gas, iron ore, uranium and petroleum-a vast number of diversified minerals-apart from recording increases in the production of sheep, cattle, grain, cotton and other products. One of the greatest resource projects in history is commencing on the North West Shelf and will result in the production of liquefied petroleum gas. It is a tremendous and magniflcent project. It will bring liquefied petroleum gas 132 kilometres from the seabed and distribute it throughout Australia. What a magnificent project. Huge amounts of capital are required. We must expect and encourage overseas participation, not to take over our enterprises completely but to have a minority shareholding. This is taking place today. This is how the great United States of America brought about its development. We have to do the same, and indeed we are doing the same.

        One of the present problems with the development of our overseas trade is the very unreliable shipping situation that exists in this country. This is by reason of industrial strife at our ports. Ships loading coal, iron ore, grain, sugar, sorghum and other products often are held up for weeks and sometimes months. When I was travelling to Canberra only this week I flew over the ports of Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla. I suppose 60 or 70 bulk carriers are being held up off these ports because of a strike involving three fellows on a tug who had a fight. One of them was suspended. So the ship workers in those three ports went out for three weeks. How do we overcome that sort of a problem? It is absolutely ridiculous. We are being held to ransom. Visits to overseas countries highlight the problem of unreliable delivery of Australian goods by reason of these strikes. We rely on our exports for our livelihood. Surely the Australian trade unions must realise this because not only is the economy of this country being penalised but also their wives and children must be affected. It is high time that the trade union movement in this country woke up and realised what a wonderful country we could have if we all pulled together. It is interesting to note that in the United States of America trade unions are on the way out because they became too powerful. Today only 20 per cent of the United States work force belong to trade unions. That ought to be a warning to the trade union movement of this country.

        The Opposition, at every opportunity, endeavours to castigate the Government for the unemployment situation. Let me say very definitely that under this Government the unemployment situation receives every careful attention, and it is improving. It is agreed that unemployment can be a problem. However, we have figures which show that there has been an improvement. In July 1979 the level of unemployment was 5.9 per cent, last year it was 5.8 per cent and this year it is 5.6 per cent. Spread over the whole of Australia, those figures represent a grand achievement. During the year to July 1981 the number of unemployed youth dropped by 10,000. It must be remembered that 6,500,000 Australians are in full employment in this country. The Government's policy of stable government will continue to assist in alleviating unemployment. Employment grew by 2.7 per cent in 1981. Some 114,000 new jobs were created and were filled by Australians.
       </para>

        The Budget has an emphasis on manpower and training programs to provide practical and positive help for young unemployed people and to increase the supply of skilled workers needed by industry. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), who in the House tonight, brought about this state of affairs. No doubt, when these programs get underway, they will be of great benefit to unemployed youth. Programs with expenditure amounting to $230m in 1981-82 for employment and youth affairs are planned. Expenditure on manpower and training programs will increase over that of last year by nearly $50m, or 31 per cent, to $197m. The Government has brought about a great increase in regard to manpower and training programs. It should be of great help to young Australians. Work experience programs will be provided with an expenditure of $65.1m, a 58 per cent increase over the figure for the last financial year. This will assist long term unemployed young people to obtain work experience over a 34-week period. Twelve thousand young people will benefit this year. Technical and further education expenditure is to be increased. An estimated 16,000 young people can take advantage of this program. It can be seen that the Government is doing everything possible to train and assist young people.

        Members on the Opposition side of the House have castigated the Government because on 31 October-that is next month-the Community Youth Support Scheme will cease. In the electorate of Paterson only two CYSS projects succeeded-one in the city of Maitland and one in the city of Mudgee-otherwise they were disastrous. Their success depended entirely on the person who had control of the project. The same situation applied to Labor's Regional Employment Development scheme which was brought in years ago. For political reasons, Opposition members have condemned the CYSS until now, but because it is to be done away with and a better scheme is being brought in, they are condemning the Government. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) stated:

        is no more than tokenism, confined to creating drop-in centres, providing cuddle therapy rather than the jobs young people really need. The guidelines even limit training, preventing formal educational classes or instruction in job skills as normally provided by educational or training institutions. The $12.6m would be better spent on genuine job creation and training programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is just what is happening today. It is a remarkable thing that, for political expedience, Opposition members can change their attitudes overnight. Interest rates are causing great concern at present, particularly in the housing area. The present level of interest rates results from the fact that the current level of demand for money in the community considerably exceeds its availability. In such circumstances interest rate rises are unavoidable unless the Government increases the availability of money. This would have inflationary consequences and would be disastrous. Unless savings banks are able to offer attractive rates to the depositing public they will not have funds to lend. That is the situation that exists. If interest rates in certain areas-for example, housing-are held down too far and for too long investors will take their dollars away from institutions which traditionally lend, and the capacity of those institutions to provide housing loans will be reduced. The experience of savings banks and permanent building societies bears testimony to this fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        The best contribution the Government can make towards a case for lower interest rates is to act in all possible ways to reduce the Government demand for money. That is why the Government acted as it did at the June Loan Council meeting-only a couple of months ago-and why in recent years emphasis has been placed on reducing the Budget deficit. We will not print notes. We are a responsible government. That can be seen from those facts which have just been enunciated. It is realised that recent events in the interest rate field have been unpopular, but economic responsibility has made it necessary for such decisions to be made, and the banking institutions made statements to this effect earlier this week. If these decisions had not been put off the pressure of adjustment would have been much greater, the economic pain more intense and the political fall-out all the greater.

        As usual, the Government has considerably increased funds for pensions, benefits and other welfare payments and services to the order of $1,265m to $9,865m for 1981-82. This represents an increase of 14.7 per cent on the 1980-81 figures. The indexation of pensions is still a policy of the Government. It will cost an extra $716m for pension rises based on the consumer price index in November 1981 and November 1982. This is a compassionate government, one which is prepared to look after the funds of the pensioners of this country. The area of pensions is growing and is a major item in Budget considerations. A total of 1.9 million pensioners in this country will receive a pension rise. The standard single rate will be $69.70 a week; an increase of $3.05 a week. The married rate will be $116.20 a week, an increase of $5.10 a week. Further, pensioner rental allowances will rise by $3 to $8 a week. Family allowance payments for the third and fourth child have increased by 50 per cent to $39 a month. Altogether, 540,000 families in this country will benefit this year. This will cost $62m, and $124m in a full year.

        Crisis accommodation will be assisted by this Government. That has been clearly set out in the Budget Papers. There will be quality and effectiveness in existing services for the handicapped. This is the year of the handicapped and funds are being made available in that area. There will be funds for production of braille and audio books for the print handicapped. Gifts this financial year to Commonwealth and State committees for the International Year of Disabled Persons will be deductible for income tax purposes. There is no doubt the Government is looking after the needy, despite remarks from honourable members opposite.

        At present we have a great resources boom and with the development of the North West Shelf gas project and coal mining in Queensland and New South Wales the demand for funds is of a very high order. Overseas capital must be welcomed to overcome this shortage. We must be very careful to see that this capital does not take over completely. The Foreign Investment Review Board vets all overseas capital propositions and has strict guidelines set down by the Government. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) is responsible for the actual decision in this field. Far too much capital is coming into Australia-mainly from West Germany, United States of America and Great Britain-for complete acquisition of farming properties. Overseas investors are being helped by the favourable exchange rates. They are, in many instances, forcing land values up. Representations have been made to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Treasurer to have a look at this situation as it could stop fine young Australians from financing agricultural properties.

        In education, the Commonwealth role in funding for schools is primarily a supplementary one in various States. It is a role which has grown remarkably in a relatively short period. It has achieved dramatic results in the improvement of the overall quality of education available for Australian children. The extent of this commitment has been maintained generally even though there are statistical indications of a growing reduction in overall numbers of school children-an estimated 23,000 fewer this year in government schools. Despite this trend the Commonwealth has maintained its direct contribution to recurrent spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        The role of the Commonwealth Government is to finance universities and colleges of advance education, the responsibility for primary and secondary schools being the responsibility of the various States. The Federal role is one of topping up funds in this area. An amount of $1,008m has been set aside for education in 1982, which is an increase of $48,295m over the 1981 level. There has been a falling off in the number of students attending government schools, and private schools which receive financial assistance only from federal sources have been allocated $489.3m.

In retrospect, I should have acted to name him after the event, quite apart from at the time.

He and those honourable members who knew of his action have brought this House and themselves into disrepute. I intend to report the incident to Mr Speaker.

         —The Appropriation Bills which we are debating tonight constitute the major economic statement for the year by a government. It is not the only economic statement for the year. Of course, it would be absurd to imagine that a government could run a country by making only one economic statement. But nonetheless this is its major economic statement. I guess that through the year the causes of many of the changes and various economic variables which take place, such as the alterations to interest rates and to the money supply and these sorts of things, are never really stated by a government. They are simply matters of day to day economic management. No matter how importantly or how hard they affect the ordinary people, these matters are never adequately debated or the causes ever properly understood. That is the reason why some of the debates in this House on such economic matters seem to have a happy knack of repeating themselves year after year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, the Government sets the agenda for what is and what is not to be discussed in the Parliament. I guess that some of the very real and very large questions facing Australia today include technology and technology transfer, the so-called resources boom, manpower policies and protection to industry and how a small economy can cope with the multinational giants. All of these very large and real issues are never adequately or properly discussed in the Parliament. In effect, we have rather piecemeal debates and give piecemeal attention to these matters. I guess that the information that the media filters out to the general public relates largely to the more immediate things rather than longer term things. It is the longer term things that we should make some mention of so that we can debate them more adequately.
       </para>
       <para>
        From that sort of background I regard this Budget document as being rather depressing and cynical. I say it is depressing because there is nothing in it for the people of an electorate such as Werriwa. I say it is cynical because the Government can always assume that it can follow a three-Budget strategy-a pretty tough Budget in its first year, a moderately tough budget the next year and, come election year, all manna can flow from heaven. This Budget comes on top of quite a few imposts on the ordinary people living in electorates such as Werriwa and people living in big cities. From 1 September there will be increased payments for health insurance due to the Government's fifth change to the health insurance arrangements since it came to office. Already interest rates have gone up and housing interest rates are going up again. The people will have to pay for that. The Budget document states that income tax collections will go up by 22 per cent this year. Housing interest rates will go up. On top of all that there has been a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax imposed. Nothing much is spared from sales tax. Today I received a letter from the local newspapers in my electorate. They take particular offence at the fact that the Government is virtually putting a tax on information.
       </para>
       <para>
        By and large the ordinary people cannot win when one considers some of these big changes and economic variables. Interest rates went up before because the Government had a tight money supply policy. In other words, there would not be enough money to service all of the demands in the economy. Of course, Government spokesmen always said that interest rates would not go up knowing full well that the money supply targets which the Government was setting predicted the fact that they must go up. Now we are awash with funds. Instead of $1,500m coming into the economy with the so-called energy development boom some $6.5 billion was received. Suddenly we are awash with money. So what happens? The Government has to put up the bond rate to mop up some of the surplus funds and interest rates go up. It does not matter if the money supply is short or the money supply is long, interest rates go up. Ordinary people cannot win. That is the sort of thing that they do not understand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consider some of the other ideas in the Budget expressed in monetary terms, such as the social welfare policy and the family allowance and relate them to an electorate such as mine. The change to the family allowance did not consider the needs and priorities of ordinary people. My electorate has many, many single parent families. Some of the suburbs in my electorate have 30 per cent to 40 per cent of single parent families. These suburbs have populations of 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 people. Most of those families have less than three children. I suggest that a single parent family with two children is in a far worse situation than a family with three or four children and where the so-called breadwinner in that household actually holds a job. I guess that there is some benefit to people who receive the supporting parent benefit if they have more than three children. But even so, no measure in that welfare benefit actually advantages the bulk of the people in an electorate such as mine. Never is any priority given to the people actually in need.
       </para>
       <para>
        The poorest people in our society are those who depend on social security payments for their only income and have to pay rent. To lift the rental allowance from $5 to $8 by some complicated formula, is so ludicrous that it is laughable. It is an absolute nonsense. Surely to God, if we are going to fiddle around with the rental allowance it could be doubled, after all the time that it has remained at this level. If we look at the fringe benefits which attach to pensions and look at all of the various provisions that attach to the unemployment benefit for example, we see that the criteria required for people to receive them go back to 1969. They have not been changed since. Again, in this Budget, the unemployment benefit for people 18 years of age and under still remains at $36. It has remained at that rate since 1975. Consider the amount that widows are allowed to earn before their pension entitlement is touched. That figure was fixed far earlier. The allowable income before the pension is touched should be something like four times as high as it is now.

        Members of the Government are quite right in saying that Australian Labor Party members said at the time that the Community Youth Support Scheme was introduced that it was a bandaid or a mollycoddling, child-minding sort of thing. That is true; it was a bandaid scheme. It was set up by the Government to try to convince the people that it was trying to do something about youth unemployment. But the fact is that as that scheme developed, due to the enthusiasm of project officers it actually became meaningful. I have said when I am required to in my electorate, each six months when the scheme comes up for funding, that by and large I think the scheme is a nonsense. I have said that the guidelines should be expanded but the scheme is doing good for some young people in the electorate. I have tried to set up one scheme and I am on the board of the committee that runs the Liverpool Community Youth Support Scheme. Anyhow, that scheme is to be folded up.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my electorate, which is part of the Sydney metropolitan area, there are other avenues for some young people to obtain some sort of training. But the Government has not addressed itself to the sorts of transition programs that it expects these people to go through. Recently, I campaigned in the New South Wales State election. There are many isolated communities in country areas. For example, Kyogle is an isolated area which has no Technical and Further Education college. There is nothing else for young unemployed people in that town bar the Community Youth Support Scheme. But Tamworth, for instance, has an excellent scheme. I can name many country towns in New South Wales which have no facility to pick up the gap and others which might have something but there is no time left to develop programs. In other words, unless the Government accepts the fact that there must be, say, a six months transition period it will certainly hurt many, many, young people.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is nothing in the Budget for the people of Werriwa. An extra dollar levy has been placed on coal. Coal mining is an industry of my electorate. The 2 1/2 per cent sales tax placed on furniture making will affect small firms in my electorate. The 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials will hurt not only people trying to build a house in my electorate but will hurt the building industry as a whole. It seems that no matter what sort of economic circumstance we have in this country, no matter whether we are in a boom, a bust or just doing fair to middling, the less advantaged never win. The Fraser Government in the years since it came into power has massively redistributed wealth away from the poor or less advantaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        In macro-economic terms, what worries me even more is that this Budget is designed to make room for the boom. It is the Budget strategy, as it has been for the past five years, that has the public sector standing back and making room for private sector expansion. But the Budget is somewhat negative even; it just says: 'Stand back'. It provides no guide. It contains no profession of the direction in which the Government would like to see the economy go. It simply states: 'We are standing back to make room for this boom'. The Budget really does little actively to promote growth. The Government claims that its strategy will allow the private sector to push growth along without increasing inflationary pressures. At least, that is what the Government says will happen. But within days of the Budget being brought down the Government was talking the boom down. I give as an instance of that a speech delivered by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), presently the Acting Prime Minister, to a conference on resource development and the future of Australian society, one of the things we should be talking about more in this place rather than outside it. He said that Australians should not be over-optimistic about the benefits flowing from resource development. He even objected to the use of the word 'boom'. When he is at counter-purpose to the Government it is nothing new; it is always an occasion for honourable members on this side of the House to think: 'Just what is he getting at?' On one occasion he was running around proclaiming a flat tax proposal, knowing full well that it would never be adopted by the government. So we have to be a bit puzzled about his latest statements.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the likely outcome of a Budget designed for a boom, a boom which the Government only five days after presenting the Budget maintained that Australians had unreal perceptions of? What is the reason for the Acting Prime Minister adopting the line he has? After all, the boom is trotted out at every election. At the time of the last election it was claimed of the order of $33 billion. Do we talk about a boom only during election campaigns? What is the reason for the statement? Was the reason the fact that the Treasury quite properly had to rein in some of the infrastructure borrowings of the States? Is it the case that the inflow of capital is pushing up interest rates and we have to pull back? Was he concerned about the impact of the boom on manufacturing? After all, the mining sector of the economy employs only about 1.4 per cent of the work force, so perhaps he is worried that the boom could double the work force in the mining sector and at the same time put tens of thousands of people out of work in the manufacturing sector or force them off farms. At this stage I am not quite sure what he is getting at. Perhaps he is just trying to have a bit all ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we should say that the current wave of resource development, irrespective of whether it constitutes a boom, represents substantial potential benefit for most Australians. The Government strategy of holding down growth will result in the level of unemployment rising in absolute terms. The Budget documents predict a rise in the level of unemployment, but I do not think anyone can make predictions a year ahead; the rise might be quite a lot greater than predicted or maybe the level will just hold. It is not certain that the slow growth policy will be particularly successful in restraining the inflation rate. Any success will be achieved at the expense of higher living standards and will be accompanied by even higher levels of unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sales tax increases announced in the Budget will alone add at least 0.75 per cent to the inflation rate. Of course, the increased health charges will add further to that figure. The Budget gave no real indication that the Government intends to accommodate rather than suppress the effects of resource development elsewhere in the economy. The Government is increasingly adopting a position of being seen to be doing something on the protection issue-for example, the reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on protection and all forms of budgetary assistance. But I doubt whether that heralds a new era in terms of the hard political decisions the Government needs to make in that area. In fact, whilst the posturing undoubtedly will continue the Government's approach really is a recipe for doing nothing for at least another 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        What concerns me most is not only that the manufacturing sector probably will unfairly feel the impact of the resource development because the Government is not planning for growth and is not taking into account or establishing a whole set of policies that will take into account the resources boom but it is simply making way for it. I am concerned also that, unfortunately, the agricultural sector is likely again to bear the brunt of the impact of the resources development. By far the most significant impact will come through the strengthening of the balance of payments. That will occur as a result of high levels of capital inflow and increased mineral exports. But the resultant appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the currency of major importers of our agricultural produce will affect agricultural adversely. Agriculture will be affected also by increased levels of domestic activity adding to existing inflationary pressures. In other words, we will get less for our goods overseas and the costs will be higher because of the boom that will not employ many people.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to acknowledge the tremendous adjustment which has been undertaken by the agricultural sector in the past. Since 1960-61 the number of farms in Australia has fallen by over 30,000 or by 15 per cent. The structure of the remaining farm businesses has changed markedly. Those adjustments have largely been forced on agriculture because, unlike parts of the manufacturing industry, it is largely exposed to the economic environment in which it operates. The adjustment that takes place in manufacturing industry is not sufficiently noted but, even more so, the adjustment that takes place in agricultural industries have never been properly taken in by those people who make pronouncements in public life, particularly people from other sectors pleading for more government benefits. It is a bit ironic that one increase in the Budget is likely to apply to the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing assistance through direct payments and taxation expenditures will actually rise. A lot of that will go to extra perks for BHP.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent times the farmers' representative groups have fought to draw attention to the losses created for agriculture because of the high levels of protection. For example, it has been estimated that an appreciation by one per cent in Australia's real exchange rate relative to the major overseas markets for rural exports would reduce the value added in the rural sector by about $100m a year. The costs to farmers of manufacturing industry protection are difficult to quantify, but they are massive. I do not have time to go into all the aspects of the protection issue with respect to the agricultural sector, but point to the fact that it is the resources boom that is causing such matters to be discussed by the farm leaders and they will have to put in a very high bid to lower the levels of protection which, in turn, will affect the manufacturing industries. That is one of the biggest crunch issues that this Parliament will have to face in the coming months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, what is recognised by the Australian Labor Party is that the immediate political, social and economic costs of substantially reducing protection are enormous. The cold economic judgment that we will be better off in the longer term by cutting protection ignores the immediate economic and social costs of the adjustments made necessary by that decision. In the medium term, what the rural sector should expect is careful but positive use of compensatory measures aimed directly at compensating for the cost to Australia of Australia's protection policies and, at the same time, at gradual, selective reductions in the levels of protection afforded individual industries, determined by their capacity to adjust within acceptable levels of social cost. But I do not think that will take place. I think the manufacturing sector and the agricultural sector will bear the brunt, because the resources development will increase the economic and social cost of protection. Imports will become greater and the opportunity costs of not importing will become greater also and the pattern of resource use within Australia will become increasingly distorted. As I said, as a result of that the distribution of income and wealth in the community will change substantially. Significantly, the incidence of hardship may occur differently. I draw the conclusion that the existing set of protective measures will be less appropriate to their objectives than they have been in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        In specific commodity terms, the Budget does nothing for the rural sector and contains reductions in real terms for most continuing programs. In real terms, government payments to rural industries outlined in this Budget are down by over 10 per cent. No new programs have been announced. In real terms, the only place in which funding for programs is actually up in money terms is in the National Water Resources Program. But even there the allocation of $35m means that only $109.4m of the $200m promised over the five years from 1978 will be spent in the first four years of the Program. That means that somehow, magically, we will have to spend $90m next year. The main reason that the total level of assistance is up in monetary terms is that the Government will be receiving less by way of repayments from the wheat industry. It is very curious to read the relevant document and to see the Treasury's calculation in that regard. Perhaps in Estimates committee hearings we will have a chance to explore that.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the exception of the fruit industry, the amounts allocated for rural research and promotion are down in real terms. The amount allocated for rural adjustment is down in real terms, yet rural research and adjustment were the only highlights in the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). They were referred to in three lines out of 27 pages. There is to be no increase in the 7 per cent interest rate paid on income equalisation deposits. There is no reference to the need for agricultural finance such as an increase in funding for the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is no reference to the problems of the meat industry.

         —I will start my comments on this year's Budget with some words of praise for the Government and make some other comments later which perhaps are not as complimentary of the Government's actions. I believe that stability and consistency in economic policy are very important ingredients in the overall approach of a government. To this Government's credit, it has been very consistent in applying its economic policy since it took office in 1975. This year's Budget is at least consistent. It continues to fight inflation, which I believe is very important. It is most damaging to the economy and to individuals if inflation is out of control. It is fair to say that the Government's record in controlling inflation has been admirable. The rate of inflation in the last financial year was only 8.8 per cent. By international standards that is a very good record. The Government is attempting to control government expenditure as best it can and generally to keep price increases to what it sees as a reasonable level.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That sort of stability and consistency is welcomed by the community. People like consistent policies. They like to be able to look ahead with some certainty, to plan ahead and to know generally where they are going. I believe that the Government has certainly helped in that way. I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Ministry generally for consistency in their approach to our economic problems. It is so easy for a government to be a big spender and to seek popularity by handing out big cheques to help people in the hope of gaining a few votes. That does not help the economy in the long run. It is a sure way of destroying it. We saw that kind of approach between 1972 and 1975. That is one reason, I believe, why the then Government lost office. People lost confidence in it because of that kind of approach. We are now seeing consistency which I certainly welcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Government is facing a difficult time. We need to watch our policies most carefully. If we do not do so and make sure that we have the right kinds of policies to satisfy the bulk of the Australian community we will be lucky if we continue to receive the kind of support we have received in recent times from the Australian community. These are not easy times for the average person. A number of problems are emerging. One is interest rates. There have been increases of some significance in interest rates paid by people, particularly those who are buying homes. So many young people are heavily committed to mortgage repayments. I know of many young families in Tasmania who are struggling to pay off their home loans. The position must be very much worse in the larger cities. The average home price in Tasmania is probably $30,000. In Sydney it may be $40,000 or $50,000. I am not sure of the exact figure. It is also very high in Melbourne. Young couples perhaps overcommit themselves. They tend to buy the best homes they can afford on their incomes. They borrow heavily. They may borrow 90 per cent of the value of their homes. When interest rates go up by one per cent or so it places a great strain on those families.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have probably kept interest rates under control for too long. If we keep the lid on interest rates eventually the pressure builds up and we have to increase them. It is much better for families if interest rates go up very gradually so that they can plan ahead. If we keep the lid on for too long they will not be able to plan ahead. Suddenly there will be very large increases in the amounts they are paying to the banks or the building societies and they cannot budget for them. They cannot cope. That position is developing at present. I do not think that governments can control interest rates. It is stupid of people to say that they can. There is a big, competitive money market. As the Treasurer has said many times and as the present Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) has said, if interest rates are kept down the money available for housing dries up. Governments certainly cannot artificially control interest rates. My plea to the Government, particularly the Treasurer, is that if increases cannot be avoided-we wish they could be-let them be applied gradually, sensibly and steadily, not in one lump sum so that families are placed in a position where they cannot effectively budget to meet their commitments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not normally support subsidies although, of course, it depends upon the nature of the subsidy. In this place we have a number of theorists. Some people call them the drys. They believe that the Government should not provide subsidies or support for individuals, companies or groups in the community, unless they are in great need. That is theory. In the real world we sometimes have to provide some support for groups in the community. If further significant increases in interest rates for home buyers occur the Government will have no alternative but to give very careful consideration to providing direct help to home buyers to overcome this problem. That might be by way of tax deductibility on their interest repayments or some more direct form of assistance. I certainly think that there is a need to provide some assistance for these people.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Budget is a good Budget if it achieves two things: Firstly, if it makes economic sense and, secondly, if it keeps the general community reasonably happy. I think we have a problem with the second of those tests. There are people in the community who are not very happy at the moment. Not enough is being done for Mr and Mrs Average. As I have said, they have been hit by interest rates. Some have to pay a little more for health costs this financial year. There have been petrol price increases, although not very recently. The trouble is that the average wage or salary earner does not have the advantage of a tax deduction. He does not get his petrol from his company as a business or professional person can do. He has to pay the full increase himself. This is hitting many families, especially those with children to maintain. It is not easy for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        People in Tasmania have had rate increases. They have been shocked by the size of those increases. I see that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) is in the House at present. He is a former warden of a municipality. He will understand what I am saying. For some people their rate bills have increased by 20 per cent or 25 per cent. Again, this is affecting the family budget. Over recent months a real strain has been placed on the family budget of the average person. He is looking for some kind of relief. The Government needs to look at a way of directing a little more assistance to the average family in the community. I trust that that can be achieved before too long. We cannot afford to wait very much longer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to mention some specific things in my speech tonight. The Government is increasing sales tax collections by $890m. That is not a small amount. It is about equivalent to the amount we receive as a nation for our beef exports. The beef industry has been mentioned often recently. It is quite a large amount of money. I generally support the idea that we should move from direct taxes to more indirect taxes. I think direct taxes tend to take away incentive, which is a very bad thing. They sap incentive and they deter people from being involved in a little hard work-opening a business, maintaining a farm, or whatever, and thus employing people. I think a move to more indirect taxes will provide more incentive for people; they will be able to decide how they will spend their money. I will support this general measure of an increase in sales tax only if there is a clear assurance that there will be cuts in direct taxes. I gather from the Treasurer's Budget Speech that the Government certainly has that in mind, that it intends to bring down at a fairly early time some cuts in direct taxes. I heard the Treasurer deliver his Budget Speech and I gathered that included in it was an assurance that the Government was closely considering cuts in direct income tax and that at the earliest possible opportunity we would see cuts in direct taxes. If we have a clear assurance that that will occur, I will be pleased to support this measure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned about the sales tax on building materials. There are so many increases in costs for young home buyers. I have just mentioned the increase in interest rates. This is a further burden that they must carry. It is not the builder who must pay the bill; it is the home buyer who has to pay it. This will increase the cost of a home, I am told by the building industry, by about $500, which really eats into the home savings grant payment that first home buyers receive. Most people who build a home are first home buyers, and most of them are young people. So that measure does concern me, and I would want to give very careful consideration to it when it returns to this House, as I believe it is likely to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to mention pensioners quickly. I am concerned that pensioners have a problem with pensioner health benefits cards. A very strict income test applies in relation to PHB cards-$40 for a single person and $68 for a married couple. The cut-off point has not altered for many years, and we have a problem developing there. Very many decent people who have worked hard in their lives are missing out on a PHB card because they are receiving a few more cents-quite small amounts-in income from dividends or as a result of increased interest rates. That card is very important to pensioners, and I would like the Government to look at that problem very carefully and to try to do something about it. There is a risk that we may be alienating some people in that area. We must be very careful about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mention briefly the Community Youth Support Scheme. There is a problem there, as the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), who is in the House, knows. He has done a good job. He has certainly argued his point forcibly. The decision has not come about through lack of a genuine concern for the young unemployed people, but there are many in the community who rely on that scheme. I would like to see the Government look at the vacuum that has been created to see whether it can create an appropriate scheme in which there will be support for young people who cannot find jobs. We say that we have training schemes, but the young people will not be totally satisfied with those training schemes because many of them will finish up back in the pool of unemployed after they have been through their training schemes. They need some support, help, guidance and advice.

        I now make an important point concerning sport and politics. I am most concerned at the threats posed by increasing political interference in the sport of Australians. If the present trend continues, I believe sport will be destroyed. It worries me that governments, including our own, are so often telling our sports men and women when and where they should play sport. They tell us that we should not play sport in this or that country or against this or that team. In my view this is wrong. Wherever possible, sport and politics should be kept apart. One should not influence the other. Our sporting teams are told that they must not go to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or South Africa and they must be careful about competing with New Zealand. Ministers, including even the Prime Minister, write to sporting associations explaining the Government's attitude and asking for full co-operation. The Government seems to be overstepping the mark. It needs to treat this whole issue with great care.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our freedoms are very sacred and must be respected by all governments in this country, whether State or Commonwealth. Australians should be completely free to play sport whenever and wherever they choose, subject to only one qualification, in my view; that is, where national security is genuinely placed at risk. Our present attitude is wrong. We are using young sports men and women as front line troops in our political wars and squabbles. Why are sportsmen such easy prey? Because they can be used as a very effective weapon without pockets being hurt and without major domestic political repercussions. The Government, of course, said that we should boycott the Moscow Games. I supported that policy. However, there must be serious doubt as to whether our official posturing was correct when we look at the issue in retrospect. Before the Games we heard so much about Afghanistan and the terrible things that were happening there. It was described as the greatest crisis since the Second World War. We said our sportsmen must not go. We really applied pressure to individual sportsmen and sporting associations. Of course, trade continued.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the tragic crisis, we were not prepared to provide direct assistance to the Afghans who were involved in the struggle following that invasion. Since the Moscow Games what have we heard? It is no longer an issue? Has the war there ended? Have the troops withdrawn? I think not. If not, what further action should we take? I must honestly say that I now doubt whether the pressure we applied should have been applied as it was. I am sorry to say that, but it is my honest view. Sports men and women have been used in this way for reasons of international political expediency.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are horrified by apartheid and we oppose sporting contact, but what action has been taken to object to the terrible human atrocities committed in Iran, Kampuchea and Uganda? Maybe some action was taken, but we do not appear, in terms of policy, to have been concerned about those problems. Our approach has not been even handed. It has been dishonest, in my view, and artificial. No credit is given in our policies for the good that can come out of genuine, honest and friendly sporting contacts with the men and women of other nations. If sport continues to be used for political purposes, where will all of this end? Perhaps a State will not send its representative teams to Canberra because it is dissatisfied with its share of tax revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I heard on the AM program this morning a gentleman making a comment about the Commonwealth Games to be held in Brisbane. He said that there were going to be protests at the Commonwealth Games and attempts to boycott them. In our domestic scene sportsmen, sportswomen and sporting events are being used to apply political pressure. I think that is a very unfortunate thing for sport in our country. We love our sport. We want to see it continue to be played in all its forms. I believe that this sort of approach, whereby our sportsmen are really being used as politicians, is undermining the real value of sport and doing great harm to it and our way of life. The Government must look again at its policy and consider whether it is intruding in the peaceful and lawful activities of its citizens at home in Australia and abroad. When these people go to other countries they are involved in legitimate activity, they are obeying their domestic law and all they may be doing is offending against the foreign policy of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say that our policy is wrong and that we should revise it as soon as possible. Sportsmen and sportswomen around Australia will begin to oppose the Government's approach if the present trend continues. In my contact with sporting associations I detect a real concern about this policy being felt by those people who are charged with the administration of sporting associations around this country. They are looking for some change in attitude and change in approach. I hope that we will see some change in the not too distant future.

         —I hear: 'Hear, hear!' I will explain why earlier this evening I offended against the forms of the House. I did not intend to do this. At the conclusion of my speech on the Budget, when talking about tariff protection, I took a couple of thousand letters written by my constituents, who are in fear of losing their jobs in the automotive industry, and flung them across the empty Government benches. I very much regret offending against the forms of the House, but I want to make an explanation in my favour. I came to this country 28 years ago, and I worked for a firm which built General Motors-Holden's Ltd in Dandenong. I drilled every hole in that steel construction, and I still remember working 14 hard days a fortnight doing that job. I feel highly emotional when I think that today people who come to this country or those who are born here will not have that opportunity if tariff reductions are imposed. I am sorry and I apologise. I regret causing any inconvenience to the cleaners in this House, who had to collect the thousands of letters which tried to convey what the workers in my electorate feel about the Industries Assistance Commission proposal.

         —Any single Budget should be part of an overall economic strategy and that strategy should be based on directing our economic, material and labour resources to the benefit of the Australian people and creating the best possible living standards and life satisfaction for them. By any standard this Budget fails that test. Even on its own explanatory analysis, it stands to create greater poverty. At the present time at least three million people in Australia are living below the poverty line. The Budget stands to create higher inflation, further unemployment, grosser inequality, higher taxes, higher interest rates, and reduced living standards. There is no question about these matters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a preliminary to my remarks tonight I will deal with some of the parameters outlined in the Budget Papers to prove that what I am saying is correct. The Budget provides for a domestic surplus of $1.5 billion, compared with a domestic deficit just three years ago of $2.3 billion. By any standards, that means that in real terms much more than $3.8 billion is being withdrawn from the spending power of Australian workers. The Budget expects only a 2 per cent increase in total employment of wage and salary earners, down 0.6 per cent on the last financial year. Yet the Budget Papers say that this increase stands to create still more inflation-11 per cent. At least 1.7 per cent of that will be a result of the sales tax increases, which ought to be rejected in the Senate. We hope that the Australian Democrats will pluck up the fortitude to join us in rejecting these increases, for which the Government does not have a mandate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Receipts are up 15.8 per cent in this Budget. An extra $810m will be collected in sales tax in a full financial year, and for the remainder of this financial year an extra $550m will be collected. I repeat: There is no mandate for these increases, which represent a rise of 38.6 per cent. Similarly, there has been a massive $3.3 billion, or 22 per cent, increase in pay-as-you-earn income taxes. The oil levy is up by 11 per cent to $3.3 billion, but company tax is up by only 10.1 per cent. Those three areas-sales tax, income tax and the oil levy-will provide 61 per cent of total receipts, and they are the areas to which wage and salary earners make the most substantial contribution. Yet company tax is up only by 10 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the balance of payments area, the current account deficit of $5.4 billion is caused mainly by the decline in exports and the rise in imports. Exports are up by only 2 per cent and imports by 20 per cent. There was a massive $6.5 billion capital inflow into this country in the last financial year, 75 per cent of which has been used to take over existing industries and to speculate in real estate. The other 25 per cent has been invested in resource development. The capital account has been transformed from a $5.4 billion deficit on the current account to a $1.15 billion surplus on the capital account. Despite the current account deficit, the dollar still revalued as a result of this capital inflow against the trade weighted index of 9.3 per cent. One notes that this capital inflow will continue over the next year, with an estimated $7 billion expected to come into the country. As capital inflow continues and export earnings recover, as they must when some of these new projects come on stream, there will be a great deal of pressure to reduce protection in the car, textile and manufacturing industries generally in this country. I fear that may happen, and it is already being seen in the pressure to reduce protection in the motor car industry, which at least in the short and intermediate terms must be resisted in the interests of protecting employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at general purpose capital grants, because herein lies a story. It is in the Loan Council capital grants area that the States receive most of their capital expenditure to provide general capital development in schools, hospitals, and so on. This year the amount provided is only $1,307m, which is the same in monetary terms as last year. The State and larger semi-government authorities have got $1,291m, which is down slightly but it is the area of additional borrowing for infrastructure that has blown out considerably. Already $4.9 billion has been authorised through the Loan Council. So far, $1,229m has already been borrowed, $697m of which has come from overseas and $532m from within the domestic market. This year $806m will be borrowed in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is it the policy of this Government to reduce the general purpose capital grants for schools and hospitals, and local government borrowing programs, and to increase the borrowing capacity given to State authorities to provide infrastructure for developing minerals processing industries? The answer must be yes because the general purpose capital grants in this Budget are down by 24.5 per cent in real terms over what they were only three years ago. Similarly, local government borrowing programs are down from $479m to $597m, or 4 per cent in real terms over the last three years. Yet for the larger State authorities, the combined infrastructure borrowing program and the normal borrowing program are up from $1,444m to $2,098m, or 11.7 per cent in real terms over the last three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point is that the losers in the Loan Council program are the general purpose capital grants and the local government borrowing programs and the winners, despite the restraint of the Loan Council at its last meeting, when it did not approve any new infrastructure borrowing projects, are still the larger State authorities-the State electricity commissions and so on. What is emerging is the fact that these funds are still insufficient because of the ad hoc nature of resource development in this country and the competitive atmosphere that exists among the States at the moment as a result of the lack of Federal cohesion in this area. Despite the increases in the funds provided through the normal Loan Council semi-government program and the infrastructure borrowing program to the larger State authorities, we can still expect State power charge increases to consumers-that is, families and small industries-and further cuts to the States in the general purpose capital programs, specific purpose programs and local government borrowing programs in the interests of providing infrastructure for resource development.

        Last year I predicted that as a result of the failure to control and rationalise resources development and capital inflow-this has been outlined by many members of the Opposition over the last 12 months-there would be increasing inflation and a blowout in the money supply. That has already occurred. There has been an increase in the money supply of 2.7 per cent over what was predicted in the last Budget. We said that interest rates would blow out and they did. They have gone up by 3 per cent since February 1980. We predicted a revaluation of the dollar and that has occurred. We predicted an increase in imports and an increase in taxation. All of these things have occurred. We predicted cuts in funds to the States, cuts to the Federal social welfare programs and reductions in employment, particularly in the area of manufacturing industry. Sadly, all of these predictions were correct. All of our worst fears have been justified. Now the Government says that it is worried about an increasing money supply spilling into inflation and about the lack of a cohesive wages policy. I point out to the Government that it has steadfastly refused to control capital inflow. It has destroyed what little wages policy it had by destroying wages indexation. Because the Government has no cohesive policies in these areas, because it refuses to control capital inflow, in this budget it is seeking instead to impose these controls indirectly by budgetting for a huge domestic surplus and by imposing higher interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the effect of this refusal to apply correct economic policies. In the area of interest rates, capital inflow over the last financial year amounted to $6.5 billion. That should have made interest rates easier but it has not done so, simply because in the interests of controlling the money supply the Government has resorted to increasing interest rates and imposing a credit squeeze. Thus we have a paradox. We have had a blowout of capital inflow and we have had a tightening of interest rates. Semi-government authorities are now offering up to 15.5 per cent and banks and building societies are offering housing loans which people cannot afford at 13.5 per cent or 14 per cent, simply because the Government will not control capital inflow into this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's policies have attacked housing with unrealistic savagery. Australians have never been further away from realising the dream of owning their own home. The Government promised to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent. Instead they have risen. There has been a 2 per cent increase since the beginning of this year. Whether people have a building society loan or a bank loan, and however favourable the rates were, there is no escaping the fact that since January this year repayments on a standard $30,000 housing loan have risen by $44.50 a month. As a rough guide, each one per cent increase in interest rates means a $22 a month rise in repayments. When interest rate increases of 1 per cent were announced last December, bank interest rates jumped in January from 10 per cent or 10 1/2 per cent to 11 1/2 per cent. Building society interest rates went from 11 per cent or 11 1/2 per cent to 12 per cent or 12 1/2 per cent. Six months later, in June, building society rates again rose to 12 1/2 per cent or 13 per cent. The latest rise, announced a few weeks ago, is yet another one per cent. All this means is that repayments on a standard $30,000 loan over 25 years from a bank have jumped from about $280 a month to $327 a month and that the repayments on such a loan over 30 years from a building society have jumped from about $300 a month to $344 a month.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, the Government is using another measure to control the money supply. It has budgeted for a huge domestic surplus. It has effected this by cutting grants to the States, particularly in the area of health and public housing, by inflicting cuts in the real value of the Federal social welfare program, particularly as it relates to the people who are least able to defend themselves-the unemployed and the pensioners-and, lastly, by increasing taxes. Let us look quickly at a few of the areas in which the cuts have been imposed. In the area of employment, the Government to its everlasting shame, has destroyed the Community Youth Support Scheme. That program was of benefit to the hard-core unemployed youth. In the last financial year there were 52,000 participants in that scheme. We are are told that in this Budget only 20,000 will benefit from the so-called alternative programs that Ministers skite about. I refer to increased provisions for the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme and for school to work assistance programs. The Government still persists with the myth that the unemployed person under 18 years of age who lives away from home can exist on $36 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the area of pensions. The Budget has done very little indeed for pensioners. It has not lifted, as it should have, the threshold at which pensions are reduced with regard to income. That threshold has remained unindexed for about eight years. It is $20 for single people and $34.50 for married couples. There should have been an increase in the threshold income levels for entitlement to pensioner health benefit cards. They were not increased from $40 for single people and $68 for married couples, even though the private health insurance subsidies from the Federal Government have now been terminated. I am thankful that the New South Wales Government has moved into the gap and has offered free hospital and associated medical treatment for various classes of pensioners and disadvantaged people, particularly those who miss out under the Federal scheme-that is, those who do not have pensioner health benefit cards. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a document showing those classes of disadvantaged people in New South Wales who will now receive free treatment in public hospitals.

         —I thank the House. What about the situation in other States? Unfortunately, the pensioners in other States who just miss out on their pensioner health benefit cards will have either to join a health scheme and pay $10 to $18 a week or run the risk of meeting the cost of catastrophic illness.

        The Government is absolutely culpable in terminating specific purpose grants to the States for recurrent expenditure for public hospitals, for community health centres and for the school dental scheme and for incorporating them in general purpose grants. The reason, of course, is that it wishes to inflict disguised cuts on the States and to mask the true extent of the cutbacks in health services. The Government has forced all but the most severely disadvantaged people-that is, the 61 per cent of single persons and 36 per cent of families who were not in private health insurance-now to take out insurance at a cost of $10 to $18 a week. My advice to people who have not previously been covered by health insurance is on two levels: Firstly, they should consider taking out hospital insurance only if they do not consider themselves a health risk, that is, if they visit doctors rarely; and secondly, if they feel that they have to take out health insurance they should join Medibank Private, which at least is still administered by the Federal Health Insurance Commission, not a private health fund, and will provide the base for a future national comprehensive health insurance scheme under a Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am particularly concerned also at the cuts in public housing finance to the States. Let me just given the bare figures and let the matter rest there and speak for itself because my time is running out. In the 1974 Budget $790m in 1981-82 prices was made available to the States for public housing. This year only $255m was made available. After we take into account total State repayments on loans already made the figure is really only $47m, as compared with $573m seven years ago. This is at a time when interest rates are going up and it is impossible for young families to raise finance through the banks to obtain private housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other means that the Government used to achieve a huge domestic surplus was an increase in taxes. The Government increased income taxes by $3.1 billion this financial year-up 22 per cent. It broke its pledge not to increase sales taxes and to impose a broadly based consumer tax.

         —Having spoken already on the Budget legislation relating to the Australian Capital Territory, I take pleasure in participating in the debate tonight as the Federal member for Denison. It will give me an opportunity later in my speech to refer to a number of Budget initiatives for Tasmania and in particular for the seat of Denison. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate first and foremost that one's prime object in remaining in Parliament is to hold one's seat. If I cease to be the member for Denison it naturally follows that I will not be Minister for anything. I take very great pride in the fact that I have been the member for Denison since 1975. I am particularly pleased that I speak tonight in this chamber, which is graced by the presence of the most distinguished Australian academic, Professor C. H. Miller from the University of Tasmania.

        The Budget is particularly good news for the Federal electorate of Denison. I am particularly elated that, contrary to all the predictions of gloom, funds have been made available for the commencement of the $8.6m Commonwealth Law Courts complex in Davey Street. This very substantial project is one for which I have fought for the past five years. This project went through the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works last year. I think there were some who believed that it was appropriate for the matter to go to tender later this financial year with it being the intent to commence work perhaps in May or June 1982. Because of the urgency of the project, because of the fact that the building industry in Tasmania and particularly in Hobart has been going through a very difficult period, I made the strongest possible representations in the hope that this project could be brought forward. I am delighted that the Government accepted that point of view. On 1 August last tenders were called for this magnificent complex, this $8.6m project, which for the first time ever will bring together under the one roof all Commonwealth judicial and legal functions in Hobart. It is a 60 day tender period. I am looking forward, as are we all, to the announcement of the successful tenderer and the commencement of work on the building proper, the excavations having been completed, before the end of this calender year and certainly well before Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        I place on record my appreciation for the efforts of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), in particular the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), and the other Cabinet colleagues who supported the bringing forward of this very important project. Hobart is the only State capital city which does not have a Commonwealth Law Courts complex. I recall that in my years of practice at the Bar the Commonwealth Courts and Commonwealth judicial functions were conducted in a variety of buildings-some six separate sites throughout the city of Hobart. The Family Court of Australia, as a matter of interest, currently sits in the MLC Building in Hobart. It is on the fourth floor and one has to travel by lift to it. To enter the building one has to pass by a shop which specialises in bridal gowns. This is a matter which has been the subject of some comment. In addition, the litigants are compelled to wait in the passage until the light goes off indicating that the case prior to their case has been completed and they are then ushered in. His Honour Mr Justice Wood of the Family Court has probably been the greatest fighter for the new Commonwealth Law Courts complex of anybody in Tasmania.

        I refer to the National Marine Science Research Centre which is to be built at Castray Esplanade in Hobart at a cost of $10.75m. Whilst this is listed in the Civil Works Program for 1981-82, it has still to complete its passage before the Public Works Committee. I place on record my personal tribute to the Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), the members of his Committee and the hardworking staff, in particular Mr Dick Fenton, for bringing forward the Public Works Committee hearing. Most of the evidence was taken before the House rose for the winter recess. I hope that the completion of the Committee's deliberations will occur shortly, that we will see a favourable report and that it will be possible for this project to proceed quickly. It will bring to Hobart on a permanent basis the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Division of Fisheries and Oceanography, which is currently based in Cronulla, New South Wales, but which by Cabinet decision of March 1980 is to be transferred to Hobart and to become the National Marine Science Research Centre. This will be a complex of world standing. It will employ directly and indirectly in the course of construction some 250 to 300 people. Upon completion it will be a $25m complex including the permanent basing of the $9m CSIRO research vessel which is to be built on behalf of the Commonwealth.

        It will work in very close co-operation with the University of Tasmania. Might I say in passing that I hope that the University of Tasmania will qualify as one of those universities selected for special funding as a centre of excellence. In particular, I draw attention to the extremely good work being done in the marine science area and also in relation to the growth of poppies and other flowers and vegetables for the production of both drugs and edible vegetable oils in Tasmania. The University of Tasmania stands ready to play its role in ensuring that the National Marine Science Research Centre becomes a centre of world standing for international research in marine science. How appropriate it is that tonight I speak on the eve of the first meeting in Australia of the delegates to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, following the adoption of the Convention last year. I pay tribute to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who played a vital role in bringing that Convention to the signature table. I place on record also the fact that Australia was the first nation in the world to ratify that Convention under Article 13 of which the world headquarters of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources will be established in Hobart.

       <para>
        All this started many years ago in the course of discussions with the then Minister for Science, the Honourable Senator James Webster, now Australia's High Commissioner to New Zealand. I must say that successive Ministers for Science, and in particular the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and his successor, have combined superbly to bring about what is an all-time first for Australia. It is the first time Australia has been chosen as host nation for an international convention, and it is singularly appropriate that the place in Australia which has been selected as the world headquarters is the city of Hobart, the most beautiful State capital and situated in the Federal electorate of Denison. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs and my colleague the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), who have been actively involved in this matter, would think it remiss of me if I did not place on record my eternal gratitude to Ambassador Keith Brennan and Mr John Ryan of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Ambassador Brennan played a vital role, and Mr Ryan chaired the Conference in Canberra last year, as a result of which the treaty was brought to the signature table. The ratification process occurred, as I said, in this very building. It is a great tribute to Australia that we were the first nation to ratify the Convention. Six nations have now ratified that treaty. When two more nations ratify it, bringing the total to eight, that treaty will come into effect. Tomorrow my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology, the Honourable David Thomson, M.C., M.P., will officially open the first meeting of the delegates to the International Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Hobart. I am deeply honoured that I will be present at that ceremony.

        I now have to turn to a subject of some weight which will not please some of my colleagues on the other side of the House. Indeed, sir, it may not please you, but, knowing your impartiality in the chair, I am sure you will appreciate that sometimes things have to be said even though they may be painful. It is a matter of constitutional importance. I note the presence in the chamber of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), himself a very distinguished barrister. I want to refer to the provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, our most important legal document and one which, more often than not, is not even looked at, considered or studied. Tonight it is my painful duty to call into question the status of the oath of allegiance of every Australian Labor Party member of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. I refer expressly to the provisions of section 42 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia which provides:
       </para>
       <para>
        Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives shall before taking his seat-

        When we turn to the schedule we see that the oath reads as follows:

        The words in the original Constitution are 'Queen Victoria' but one will see from the note that the name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time. So it should read:

       <para>
        Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law, SO HELP ME GOD!

         —Thank you, sir. I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. So the oath taken as a condition precedent to taking one's seat in this House or in the Senate is that 'I, A.B.'-inserting the name-'do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors, according to law, so help me god!' I now doubt the status of the oaths and affirmations of allegiance taken by every ALP senator and member of the House of Representatives in view of the clear and unequivocal objective of the ALP to the establishment of Australia as an independent republic. Let me develop that point further. It is now a basic and fundamental policy objective of the ALP to ensure that Australia becomes a republic. How on earth can Labor members and senators square that with their oath of allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II? The Labor Party's commitment to socialism, whilst couched in terms of reform, also contemplates a change by what is described-I shall quote directly from the ALP biennial national conference report-as union action. Is this Parliament and is this nation to understand from the decisions taken at the thirty-fourth biennial national conference of the ALP at the Southern Cross Hotel, Melbourne from 27 July to 29 July that the objectives of a socialist Australia and a republican Australia are to be obtained by union action? I put that because that is the question which constitutional lawyers are asking at this moment. Is it the fact that following the biennial national conference of the ALP at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne the objectives of a socialist Australia and a republican Australia are to be obtained by union action? There is one way to put this matter to an end: I call on all ALP members immediately to renew their oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen.

         —by leave-The Government has decided to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the Australian meat industry. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) indicated in his statement yesterday, allegations of malpractice have been made about aspects of the meat industry and evidence of malpractice has been produced which gives rise to serious concern on the part of the Australian industry and Australian consumers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government is responsible for the maintenance of standards in the meat export industry, but the problems appear to go wider than this, and into areas of State administration. A Federal royal commission necessarily has powers limited to the area of Commonealth responsibility-the export of meat. The Government therefore has invited all States to issue the royal commission with concurrent powers which would enable it to examine the meat industry in relation to human consumption and other uses domestically. The Victorian Government has already indicated its intention to take this action, so the royal commission will cover at least the handling of meat for domestic purposes in that State. His Honour, Mr Justice Albert Edward Woodward, O.B.E. will head the royal commission. The royal commissioner will inquire into the following matters:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) whether administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export are adequate to ensure that all meat exported from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by law;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred, in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth, of malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past 10 years, in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat;
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective;
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The royal commissioner is directed to make such recommendations arising out of his inquiry as he thinks appropriate, including recommendations regarding the legislative or administrative changes, if any, that are necessary or desirable. He is authorised, at his discretion, to defer his inquiry into any matter that is the subject of a police investigation or of criminal proceedings in a court. Further, if the Governor-General so approves, he may conduct his inquiry in combination with any inquiry that he is authorised to make by any commission issued by a State or States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The royal commission will report not later than 1 September 1982. The Government is fully seized with the urgency of this matter. However, it is also important that the inquiry be thorough and wide-ranging. The royal commission will be authorised to make interim reports as appropriate. The royal commission is separate from the management inquiry announced by the Minister for Primary Industry to review practices and procedures in the documentary and physical control of meat destined for export. Measures have already been taken to tighten control of procedures. The management review by independent consultants will check these procedures and report urgently whether anything further needs to be done in this field. The royal commission is not prevented from commenting also on any aspects in this area that seem to it to require remedy; but because a royal commission is necessarily a longer process, this intermediate step is being taken to verify the effectiveness of the control procedures now in place. I do not need to emphasise to the House the urgency and importance of this matter, concerning as it does an industry vital to the prosperity of the country. It is the Government's wish that this inquiry satisfy the Australian public that all available measures are being taken to protect and preserve the Australian meat industry. I present the following paper:

         —The Opposition declared that there should be a royal commission into this matter. We declared that more than a week ago. We also said, however, that the terms of reference should be comprehensive and should allow a wide-ranging investigation into all matters related to this meat export scandal and also the associated concern in the community related to meat produced for domestic consumption. I note that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has declared in his statement that the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the maintenance of standards in the meat export industry. He then went on to say that there are certain areas which are State government responsibilities and that, therefore, the powers of the royal commission will be limited. However, the national Government will seek authority from the State governments to allow the royal commission to extend the ambit of its investigation into those areas which would be otherwise seen as the province of State governments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It seems to me that this is a somewhat restrictive interpretation of the Commonwealth's authority in this area. Given the gravity of the situation and the very real possibility that some States will oppose co-operaton with the royal commission-I understand that Queensland has already declared that it will not co-operate with the royal commission-it would seem appropriate for the Federal Government to exploit all of the constitutional authority available to it. To do anything less than that would be to fail to ensure the adequacy, the comprehensiveness and the penetration of such an investigation. Section 51 (i) of the Constitution refers to trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States. So it seems that the authority of the royal commission of inquiry established by the national Government can go beyond merely export markets and reach into intra-State trading. Section 51 (xx) of the Constitution establishes the authority of the national Government in relation to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. I presume that abattoirs, even operating at the State level, would largely come within the ambit of that authority. That, therefore, ought to be exploited.
       </para>
       <para>
        I move on, however, to the terms of reference. The Opposition expresses concern that on one reasonable literal interpretation of the terms of reference they appear unduly restrictive. Terms (a) and (b) refer to administrative arrangements and procedures concerning the supervision and handling of meat for export and malpractices occurring or which might have occurred in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat. On a reasonable literal interpretation of those terms of reference they would seem to be restricted to activity in the area of the physical work which is associated with the processing and the handling and supervision of meat destined for export. That, in itself, is unremarkable as long as that is understood. If that is understood, then, for a comprehensive inquiry to be undertaken, subsequent terms of reference need to be expanded considerably. However, we find that terms (c), (d) and (e) clearly restrict, on one reasonable interpretation, the authority of the royal commissioner. Terms (d) and (e) flow from term (c).
       </para>
       <para>
        Term (c) limits, as a term of reference, the authority of the royal commissioner to allegations made. Whether they are made is not important in terms of this point which I wish to make. It limits the authority of the royal commissioner to allegations made. It may well be that evidence has become available to the Public Service or to a Minister in a form other than allegations. But the royal commissioner is restricted to considering only those matters which are based on allegations which have been made. What we want to establish beyond any doubt is whether, on the basis of the information available to the department and to the Minister, in whatever form, apart from, as well as, allegations, either the Minister or the Public Service or both discharged their duties with a clear display of due diligence and responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we accept a reasonable interpretation of term of reference (c) and, therefore, the limitations placed on terms (d) and (e), which obtain their authority flowing from term (c), these terms of reference hobble the royal commissioner. In the circumstances, if the Government asserts that it wants a completely comprehensive inquiry and that it wants no immunity in this matter, not for the top levels of the Public Service, nor for Ministers, and that it wants to come before the Parliament and display clean hands at all levels, it will have no quibble about accepting an amendment which will leave no doubt about the comprehensiveness of the authority which the Parliament wishes to extend to the royal commissioner. I move:
       </para>
       <para>
        That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House is of the opinion that the terms of reference of the proposed Royal Commission should be amended to take account of the following matters'.
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) Whether legislative, administrative or other arrangements and procedures for the supervision and control of all relevant stages leading to the export of meat from Australia are adequate to ensure that all meat exported meets legal requirements and protects Australia's export markets;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred in the preparation, processing or handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) whether investigations in relation to information which was available or could reasonably have been available in relation to malpractices which occurred or are occurring or which were alleged to have occurred have been diligently pursued.
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) if the answer to 'c' is no, the persons, including Ministers, responsible for that lack of diligence;
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) if there were such persons responsible for lack of diligence whether such lack of diligence constituted illegality, corruption or impropriety.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an adequate set of terms of reference. It provides the comprehensiveness which is required in a case such as this. On the basis of what we are putting forward we are talking about not only allegations but also information which was available or which could reasonably have been available in relation to malpractices. Surely there can be no quibbling about such a reasonable proposition as that. The Government should come before the Parliament and be candid in its declaration that it wants to leave no stone unturned in the investigation of this outrageous scandal. If it is not prepared to accept this amendment then I think it quite reasonable for us to conclude that here is a clear case of its reluctantly being forced to accept a royal commission of inquiry. It is clear, by the course of events, by the momentum and force of public opinion, that there was no choice for the Government in that respect. But it is equally clear that it is trying to create an area of immunity, if possible, by a restrictive interpretation of terms (c), (d) and (e), as proposed by the Acting Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government alleges that this is not so, then as a matter of good will and in the pursuit of bipartisanship, which will be forthcoming immediately, it can accept the amendments which we have proposed. The amendment I have moved contains a suitable set of terms of reference for a royal commission of inquiry, terms which would be appropriate from a parliament genuinely concerned about the outrageous disclosures which have been associated with this matter and which, most unfortunately, leave a cloud above the head of the Government and the Public Service, in the most senior positions.

No matter how the Government tries to argue the situation, the royal commissioner is limited by term (c) to allegations made, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said. The Opposition is asking the Government not to limit the terms of reference to the allegations but to allow the royal commissioner to deal with information because information could have come to the Department on its own initiative. It does not require an allegation.

         —The objection is reasonable. We should have been given an opportunity to put our views. We have a valid objection and suggest that if the terms of reference outlined by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) were applied strictly they would relate only to past malpractices. The question is: What about the information which may have led to the uncovering of a malpractice? The big issue is whether the officials, the public servants, applied themselves diligently to investigating the information. Honourable members must bear in mind that there is prima facie evidence from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police which suggests that matters were not diligently pursued. He has made a statement to that effect.

         —Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point at issue, as you said, is what needs clarification. The question is whether the royal commissioner will be able to deal with information available to either a department or a Minister and whether it can report to this Parliament on that. That is what this is all about. If he is limited in inquiring into allegations made-that will be the case-we do not think that is wide enough scope. What we are saying is: Why talk about allegations when we should be talking about information? Without delaying the House unduly, in support of what my Leader has said, I submit it is very clear that if a government is not prepared to investigate information made available there is something wrong with the government or the department concerned. Of course, if every piece of information was properly investigated the Government has nothing to worry about. All that paragraph (c) of the amendment calls for is an answer to whether there was impropriety by any person. Surely the Government should not run away from determining that. All the amendment does, basically, is agree that we should have the widest ranging investigation.

        The other day my Leader said here that the public is very concerned that somebody may not have pursued his duties diligently. It is also concerned about malpractice and corruption. The criminal courts can deal with malpractice or corruption. Criminal proceedings related to such matters could flow from the royal commission inquiry. But this Parliament has to deal with lack of diligence or lack of propriety because they are not criminal matters, they relate to the responsibility of people in office, whether it be ministerial office or an office in a public service area. If there has been impropriety by such people they should be removed from office. That does not require criminal prosecution. That is the distinction I make. I think the Government would be wise enough to accept the amendment moved by the Opposition.

         —I thought the Opposition would welcome the announcement of the establishment of the royal commission into the Australian meat industry. I thought that in general terms it would accept the terms of reference for that royal commission because they are comprehensive and wide ranging. The request of the Opposition was that they be of that nature. The way Opposition members are going on tonight, it seems to me that it would not matter what terms of reference were brought up. In a pedantic manner they would want to redraft them just to satisfy themselves that they were able to make changes or amendments.

        The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) dealt with two aspects. Firstly, he seems to believe that we should have drawn up terms of reference that would include inquiring into meat used for domestic consumption and that we should be relying on section 51 (i) of the Constitution, the trade and commerce powers, to enable us to do that. I suppose it is a matter of interpretation of the Constitution how far we can go in using that power to enable such an inquiry to take place. But the advice given is that we do not have the power to investigate all the domestic aspects that it would be necessary to investigate if we were to have a total examination of the issue. What we have done in the terms of reference and in the statement I have made is to invite the States to give a commission to the royal commission to allow it to investigate the domestic matters as well as the handling of meat for export. As has been stated, Victoria is prepared to co-operate in such a royal commission inquiry. I hope that other States, particularly the principal States, such as Queensland and New South Wales, will also participate in the inquiry. I think they will leave themselves in a difficult position if they do not do so, because so many aspects of the handling of meat is a State responsibility. The States will place themselves in a questionable position if they do not join in the inquiry. What fears has a State government about joining in the inquiry unless it has some concern?

The second point that the Leader of the Opposition made was that the terms of reference as they are drawn up refer only to allegations concerning and malpractices occurring in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat. I think that both of the words 'allegations' and 'malpractices' would be interpreted to cover what the honourable member said was lacking. I am sure that there is adequate scope in the terms of reference for the royal commissioner to be able to examine all aspects if he believes that there may be some malpractice and certainly to investigate the allegations. I believe that the allegations that have been made in the course of 10 years-there must have been many-will enable him to examine any aspect of the matter. To imagine that the terms of reference are inadequate is, I believe, to be mistaken.

They give one the impression that the Opposition thinks it is in government and that it can draw up its own terms of reference I do not believe that there is a vast difference in essence between the terms of reference proposed by the Government and the alternative, pedantic terms of reference proposed by the Opposition. Therefore, I reject the alternative terms of reference.

I do not have with me the quotation I made from the report of the Committee of Inquiry to examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems, the top of page 41 of the so-called Kelly report on dual meat inspection. It was a clear recommendation that the issuing of export stamps by abattoirs should cease. I think these things should be investigated. Another thing that should be investigated is that all the terms of reference concentrate on the handling of meat for export. It is very clear that they do not take into account allegations or specific information on meat transferring from one State to another. Meat branded for pet food has been going into the domestic market. Aspects of the domestic market also sought to be investigated. I do not think the terms of reference cover that aspect.

         —I guess this is something of an anticlimax. I have been waiting to speak on the Budget for some time, but I have the feeling that I have had to take second place to kangaroos, horses and even donkeys. In the adjournment debate I want to raise the attitude of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and his Department to the practice of acupuncture. The practice of acupuncture does require special skills in the medical field. The Australian Acupuncture Society is composed of medical practitioners who practice those skills, all of whom have had at least six months special training and most of whom have had much more than that. I believe the Department suggests that it is not a scientific method of treatment, but this is quite untrue. There is in both Western and Eastern medical literature a wide body of opinion with regard to the scientific basis of acupuncture. It is not just testimonials which are used. I have had experience of it on a personal basis, as I suffer from a chronic and painful neuromuscular complaint. Acupuncture has been most effective in controlling pain and muscle spasm in that complaint. I realise that pain is subjective and that only the patient measures it, but certainly muscle vesiculation and muscle spasm are measurable.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The mechanism by which the effects are brought about is suggested to be a humoral mechanism by the release of chemical substances called endorphins from the nerve endings. There is on record research which is attempting to assay and to isolate those endorphins so that they may be used further. The use of acupuncture in pain management is already proven. I would have thought that it was a practice in pain management that would have been encouraged. Its proper use in pain management diminishes the consumption of analgaesic drugs and so is a saving in the pharmacy area. Yet the fee allowable for the skilful practise of acupuncture is only that available for the shortest consultation. I have an idea that the Minister, or someone in his Department who perhaps has an old-fashioned feeling about the practice of this art, believes that medical acupuncturists set up their patients like batteries of laying pullets so that they can go along the line, twiddle acupuncture needles and collect vast fees for a number of patients. I suppose that unethical practice occurrs everywhere, but the majority of acupuncturists are very certain in trying to get properly diagnosis and treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital some ten years ago an acupuncture research clinic was set up. This year, with the agreement of the medical staff association, that is now a normal acupuncture clinic. In other words, it is one of the recognised out-patient clinics where the art is practised. Yet not only has the Minister's Department limited the fee payable but also its directors in the various States have now said that the principal medical officer of the Department has also instructed that including any associated consultations in the same day in the description for item 980 has a wider connotation than to suggest only those consultations dealing with the same condition are not payable. A person who has acupuncture treatment cannot receive treatment from the same doctor on the same day for any other condition. So a person who is having acupuncture should not cut a hand or break an arm because he will not get paid medical benefits.

         —Before we rose for the week back in our electorates the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) made an interesting speech in an adjournment debate in which he claimed, in relation to small government, that probably the most appropriate measure of the extent to which any government becomes involved in the economic affairs of the nation is the proportion of gross domestic product which is absorbed by total Budget receipts. I raise this matter because it seems to me to establish very clearly the difference between the Government and the Opposition in the understanding of what really happens in our economy. To suggest that the size of government receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product underlines the trend to big government seems to me to misunderstand totally the reality of big government and what has happened in the last six Budgets of this Government as compared with the three Budgets of the previous Government.

       <para>
        When determining the appropriate measure of big government it is totally irrelevant to deal with revenue when in fact the bulk of the increase in the revenues of this Government has been to make up for the gap between revenue and expenditure that opened up during the period 1973 to 1975. In other words, the figure the honourable member for Hunter cited was as irrelevant as is possible to establish his case. There is no more irrelevant figure than the one he cited. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the relevant measures of big government, the size of government, as a proportion of gross domestic product. I seek to incorporate the reality rather than the fancy presented by the honourable member for Hunter. I seek leave of the House to incorporate two tables from the latest Budget statements.

         —I thank the House. The first table shows Budget outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product. There we see the reality of big government, because big government means big spending. In 1975-76, Budget spending represented 30.1 per cent of gross domestic product. It has since been reduced to 27.6 per cent. The reality is that the latest figures in effect overstate the involvement of Budget spending in gross domestic product because of the increased number of pay days in the Public Service which are included in this year. As the House knows, that has a significant impact of roughly one per cent on Government spending. Clearly, there has been a significant reduction in Government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product under the present Government. That is significant enough, and certainly denies the point made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown). Even more significant is the proportion of gross domestic product made up by the deficit, in other words, the amount by which the Government spends more than it takes in. The previous Government, and surely this must be dramatised by these figures, managed to fiddle the books. It managed to have a very low increase--

Our husbandry has been so far ahead of the previous Government's that it does not matter. Some 4.9 per cent of the gross domestic product was made up by the deficit of the previous Government. If we add Telecom, which had a surplus, we would diminish the amount of that deficit. We can see that the deficit has been reduced to only 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product. There we have an institution that has a deficit which in fact would benefit the deficit figure here. This organisation has a surplus. It would have benefited--

         —I wish to draw attention to a matter which is causing concern to several church and humanitarian groups in my electorate, namely, the future of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. The razor gang report states that ADAB will be retained as an entity with its own director. However, officers of ADAB are to be integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and the State regional offices are to be reviewed with a view to giving the responsibility for supervision of sponsored overseas students to tertiary education institutions. Administration of the overseas student training program will be transferred to the State offices of the Department of Education, and greater use is to be made of private sector travel firms.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What this means in reality is that a co-ordinated, effective team of highly specialised professionals will be shuffled around into other positions where their skills will not be utilised. For example, sponsored students have special needs which ADAB officers are highly trained, experienced and effective in handling. To suggest transferring the care of these students to education departments which are already overloaded and underfinanced and which do not wish to accept such a task anyway is to abrogate real responsibility for these students. The same problem will be experienced when the specially trained and experienced social workers on the ADAB staff are replaced or transferred. The continuation of student care by these social workers is of grave concern to ADAB officers. Academic and personal supervision of the needs of overseas students has proved a vital need over many years, and ADAB staff have been able to provide this most effectively. To suggest in addition that travel in this area be transferred to private travel agencies is to indicate a serious lack of understanding of the subtleties of internaional relations and the care of people from many different political and economic areas who are studying in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recommendations of the razor gang, rather than reflecting a co-ordinated manpower and efficiency plan, simply suggest a withdrawal from the co-ordinated system of the present and a return to the fragmented early days of the scheme. The 25 staff members of the Melbourne ADAB regional office are each specialised officers performing specific tasks within a co-ordinated team. The co-operation and co-ordination with voluntary community groups which is an integral part of the operation of the scheme would in itself be virtually impossible if the tasks of ADAB are fragmented and dispersed among several other bodies. The record of ADAB in distributing and utilising aid money allocated by the Federal Government and funding practical projects is a sound one. At a time when reviews are in the air, the efficient distribution of such large sums of money would seem to be an essential priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems appropriate for a centralised and experienced team to be utilised rather than to be fragmented and threatened with dispersal and wastage of its own specific expertise. The foreign aid industry, worth over $500m, would surely seem to warrant professional and specific overseeing. Assistance provided by our Government to recipient countries in the form of direct grants for specific projects and the care of overseas students has required assessment, appraisal and evaluation to ensure maximum developmental benefit to the recipient country. The dispersal of ADAB functions, which will mean its virtual abolition, will result in a loss of important expertise and understanding which has been built up in the area of developmental issues and relationships with voluntary agencies and committees working together. The razor gang's proposals in relation to ADAB will certainly mean wastage in real terms of manpower, planning and efficiency. In view of the large sums of money involved and the international standing and reputation of our country, I ask the Government to reconsider these proposals.

         —Very rarely do I go on the attack, but three or four months ago, prior to the Budget, a rally was organised in Hobart to protest against the Budget. I was taught always to respect the cloth, but on this occasion the person who organised the rally was one named Julian Punch, a Catholic priest. So the people of Hobart were subject to a protest rally against the Budget. I agree that probably there is some justification for rallying against the Budget. Of course some things in the Budget do not meet all the requirements of all the people in Tasmania, or in that case Australia. Who do honourable members think was the key speaker at the rally?

The person they organised was talking about dog's meat. I have checked up on this person and I believe his qualifications are much the same as those of John Halfpenny. We had a rally in nice, quiet Hobart which was organised by a former Catholic priest, now a public servant and working for the State Government. Mr Halfpenny was brought across to address the rally, and a person in the guise of an age pensioner virtually cried to the people, but I think that his political persuasion is suspect also. That is the sort of rally that was organised against us in Tasmania-nice, quiet Tasmania. He got all the people up-tight. He got all the people there. Another interesting point is that if we had a rally probably one member of the Press would come. Everybody from the media in Hobart was at the rally.

         —Last night, before my time expired, I was making a case that in light of new evidence the Panavia Tornado aircraft should be included on the short list of suitable replacement aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. I said that 800 of these aircraft were already in production for three nations. The price of these aircraft is fully known and firm. What could have been the difficult question of Australian industrial participation presents no real problem because most of the work in this area was done when the Tornado was a contender. This aircraft is particularly suited to the needs of Australian industry, and industrial participation should be made easier because the three largest aerospace companies in Europe, all leaders in their field, would be able to provide work outside the direct scope of the Tornado. So we could end up with the sort of electronics industry which we would have had in this country had the Government in 1963 opted for the TSR2 aircraft instead of the politically expedient F111 aircraft.

It is a decision that should be made by a Prime Minister in good health, free from the distractions of the Budget and the current obsession with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I do not think that the Parliament should be divided on this issue. What is at stake is the acquisition of the most suitable aircraft for the RAAF-an aircraft that will take the first line of our defences into the decades of the next century. To simply reopen negotiations and include this remarkable aircraft on the short list is a very small step for the Government to take.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I wish now to refer to another aspect of defence that is causing me some concern, the replacement of trucks for the Australian Army. The short list for these trucks comprises two vehicles, the Mercedes Benz and the Bedford. I do not think anyone seriously believes that the Bedford will be a genuine contender. It is 20 years old and about to be phased out of production in the United Kingdom. The Mercedes Benz is no doubt technically a very advanced truck. It has all sorts of things such as outboard disc brakes and torsion bar suspension. By and large I support the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its review of the automotive industry in this country. Here we have a clear case of an Australian company, International Harvester Australia Ltd, having available a perfectly adequate vehicle-a vehicle that was designed in conjunction with Army personnel. These trucks have served the Australian Army very well in the past. We will probably be selling them to the New Zealand Army and importing the Mercedes Benz.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the attributes of the Mercedes Benz is the torsion bar suspension but in the event of Europe being isolated we would be isolated from the vital parts for these trucks. We understand leaf spring technology. Leaf springs are perfectly adequate for this country. The reasons for the choice of this truck really elude me. It is not a matter of cost saving because the International costs about the same as a Mercedes Benz. I am sure that the performance of the two vehicles is comparable. That leaves us with two reasons for this hasty decision. It is a hasty decision, for nobody really believes that trucks are essential for the defence of Australia. Army vehicles are generally underrated, under-utilised and over-serviced. There are plenty of spare parts and as a rule they do not wear out. They will last for many years to come. I suspect that the cretins from the National Country Party believe that there is some advantage to be gained by buying from the Germans. They seem to be under the illusion that we are going to sell Germany some more agricultural products. Of course, that is not the case. It will not happen. But in this wild dream, the Government is threatening the existence of truck design and manufacture in this country. We are destroying jobs. Jobs would be available for many people. Those jobs would not be compensated for in terms of tariffs, because the cost of the trucks is comparable. The Government is doing this for no real purpose. I ask the Government to have a close look at this matter.

         —Tonight I wish to refer to some very misleading and, in places, totally irresponsible-indeed, scurrilous-advertisements being undertaken by the New South Wales Minister for Health and the New South Wales Premier in association with a number of campaigns for Labor candidates in the New South Wales election. I refer to the claims being made in relation to the provision of free health care services for various groups within the community. I refer firstly to a pamphlet under the signature of the Minister for Health, Mr Stewart, entitled 'New Health Charges 1981'. In this pamphlet Mr Stewart states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a result of changes to Federal Government legislation affecting health funding and health insurance, new health arrangements come into effect on September 1.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means free hospital treatment in New South Wales has ended for all, with some exceptions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exceptions that he refers to are only those people who qualify for the new Commonwealth health care card, plus a few others that the New South Wales Government will cover. Mr Stewart then goes on to pick up the exact wording of the statement on health care by the Commonwealth Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). He says that the exceptions include migrants and refugees in their first six months in Australia, those on unemployment or special benefit and those on low incomes. He uses exactly the same figures as the Commonwealth Minister used in an endeavour to gain the credit and the kudos for providing health care cover to those people. At no stage does he mention that all pensioners, whether they be age pensioners or pensioners of other ilks, such as supporting parents, those on sickness benefit, those on invalid pensions and the like, will also continue to be covered. I refer to some of the paid advertising in my local area-paid for incidentally by the New South Wales taxpayer. One such advertisement states:
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one in NSW will be denied hospital treatment because of financial hardship or inability to pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        All pensioners and dependants will be treated free.
       </para>
       <para>
        Eighty per cent of those pensioners are provided with free health care anyhow through the Commonwealth's program. They, of course, are the people who have a pensioner health benefit card. The advertisement continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        People on Unemployment or Special Benefit . . . free.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has nothing to do with the New South Wales Government; it is the policy of this Government. The advertisement goes on to categorise under what circumstances such people are treated free and refers to exactly the same figures as those given by the Commonwealth-$68 for married couples and $40 a week for single people. The candidate concerned then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        People earning less than $160 a week . . . or $96 a week for a single person . . . free.
       </para>
       <para>
        Free treatment is provided by whom? It is provided not by the New South Wales Government, but by the Commonwealth Government. The candidate then says:
       </para>
       <para>
        People with slightly higher income but who cannot afford insurance will be treated free at public hospitals providing they use Hospital Medical Officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        That situation has existed for a long time. When was the last time that a public hospital took legal action to recoup fees from people who could not pay? Worse still, another advertisement states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Wran Government has decided that free hospital and medical treatment will continue to be provided to uninsured pensioners at Public Hospitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have pointed out, that treatment relates to a relatively small number of pensioners who are not presently entitled to a pensioner health benefit card.

        I believe that that sort of advertising is entirely misleading. Indeed, it is scurrilous. I trust that the Commonwealth Minister for Health will take the matter up and point out that the claims being made by the New South Wales Minister for Health and some of the Labor candidates in various New South Wales electorates are entirely misleading. They are endeavouring by scurrilous means to obtain credit for the huge number of people to whom the Commonwealth provides free medical and hospital services.

       BAUXITE ROYALTY PROVISIONS IN MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRIES
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Australia. There is no Commonwealth royalty imposed on the export of bauxite from Australia. Production royalties are a matter for State Governments. The current rates are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Queensland (Weipa)
      </para>
      <para>
       Two rates apply:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) for consumption outside Queensland the royalty is the largest of:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) $1 per tonne
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) 10% of the F.O.B. price per tonne including royalty
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) the rate decided by the formula

      </para>
      <para>
       P2 where
      </para>
      <para>
       R is the rate of royalty expressed in dollars per tonne
      </para>
      <para>
       P1 is the weighted average of the Alcan world price converted to $A for the 10 calendar years prior to shipment
      </para>
      <para>
       P2 is as for P1 but for the 10 calendar years ended 31 December 1978
      </para>
      <para>
       At present prices it is understood that the royalty under the formula equals $A1.33 per tonne
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) for consumption within Queensland the rate fixed in (a) above is halved
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Northern Territory (Gove). Royalty rates are $A0.50 per long ton for exported bauxite and $A0.40 per long ton for treated bauxite.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Western Australia. All bauxite currently mined in W.A. is refined in that State. Royalties are payable on alumina production rather than on bauxite production. Royalty payable is calculated by the formula
      </para>
      <para>
       R = $0.5 x P

       At current prices this rate is $A1.52 per tonne of alumina.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Brazil. Royalty of 15% for internal consumption and 4% for export, based on mine gate value.

       4.8 = US$24.81 per tonne at current metal prices (minimum levy US$15 per tonne)
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Royalty of US$0.60 per long ton of dry bauxite exported.
      </para>
      <para>
       Total to be paid to the Government is reduced by the amount of income tax paid.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) France. Bauxite is not exported. Production incurs a royalty of FF43.92 per tonne but payment of the royalty entitles exemption from a considerably higher tax levied on all commercial enterprises.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) Ghana. A production levy of a maximum of 6% of gross proceeds, depending on the grade of bauxite.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) Greece. None.
      </para>
      <para>
       (g) Guinea. Export levies apply but vary according to project. Levies are paid by the purchaser rather than the producing companies. In each case the Government participates directly to bauxite mining.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Sangaredi project. Export levy of 0.75% of Alcan's world aluminium price, adjusted to the quality of the bauxite concerned. This levy currently equals US$13.13 per tonne of bauxite.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) OBK project. Fully State-owned. Export levy of 0.55% of Alcan's world aluminium price. This levy currently equals US$9.63 per tonne of bauxite.

       (k) Indonesia. No royalty exists as production is carried out by a Government owned company.
      </para>
      <para>
       Export duty of 10% of f.o.b. price of the bauxite.
      </para>
      <para>
       (l) Jamaica. Production levy of US$21.20 per tonne on base level production but under a complicated formula varies depending on production levels and metal prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       (m) Malaysia. No royalty.

      </para>
      <para>
       They levy is applied on a mine by mine basis and the amount payable varies according to the quality of the bauxite. Current levies are approximately US$23 per tonne of bauxite.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition a royalty, ranging from US$0.50 to US$0.56 per long ton, applies.

       (1) If a member of the Services applies for a discharge from that Service on the grounds that continued enlistment would jeopardise that person's marriage and if written confirmation by an authorised social worker accompanies such an application, is it the Services' personnel management policy to reject the applicaiton for discharge.

       (2) Is it the policy of the Services to refuse applications for honourable discharge to persons who have consistently demonstrated their desire to leave the Service before their period of enlistment is completed.

       (1) Each application for discharge on request for personal reasons is cosidered on its merits. Appropriate specialist comment from relevant sources, for example, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, welfare bodies, family doctors, chaplains and medical specialists is invariably sought. A secondary consideration is the manning implications and any possible consequential effects such as posting turbulence. The decision reached would be dependent on the relative influence of all these factors.

For example, frequent seagoing service in the Navy and field service in the Army involve family separation which can influence members' attitudes. Activities of this kind are limited in the Air Force.

      <para>
       Under long-standing arrangements, many animal and plant quarantine functions at Australian ports of entry are undertaken on the Commonwealth's behalf by State Departments of Agriculture or their equivalent. Internal organisational arrangements for their performance are matters for the States concerned. To date, States have preferred, for various reasons, to maintain separate animal and plant quarantine personnel to support the baggage inspection function at major ports.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, an organisationally integrated Agricultural Health Service was implemented by the Northern Territory Government in 1979 following the introduction of self government and this provides, inter alia, merged animal and plant quarantine services relating to baggage inspections undertaken at Darwin airport. Operational experience with this arrangement will allow appropriate comparisons to be made with the systems which have traditionally operated at major ports of entry elsewhere in Australia.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The problem of the external indebtedness of developing countries has received much attention in the past few years and especially since the second round of large increases in oil prices. I have not seen the study quoted by the honourable member, but the problem has been well documented in other places. I refer for instance to Occasional Paper No. 3 of the International Monetary Fund, 'External Indebtedness of Developing Countries', May 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Policy questions related to developments in the debt situation of deficit nations are kept under continuing review by the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and by several other international organisations. The IMF and IBRD have in recent years taken measures to improve the access of member countries, including developing countries, to their resources. These include increased drawing entitlements and longer-term financing in the IMF, sale of part of the IMF's gold holdings, and interest subsidy accounts, for the specific benefit of developing country members, and the introduction of structural adjustment lending in the IBRD.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The debt situation of the oil importing developing countries could potentially involve serious implications for the international financial system. However, the present situation is by no means unmanageable, for several reasons. First, when allowance is made for inflation or when debt or debt servicing obligations of the developing nations are related to indicators of those countries' abilities to pay (e.g. exports or measures of national product), the dimensions of the problem, while considerable, are put in a more appropriate prespective. Second, while there have been instances of debt servicing difficulties, the process of recycling funds to nations experiencing enlarged current account deficits has in general proceeded quite effectively. Third, there is growing recognition-in both debtor countries and in the financial institutions whose lending to such countries has expanded rapidly-that there are potential problems which require adjustment of domestic economic policies. In a growing number of cases this has required temporary financing from the IMF related to implementation of economic policy packages agreed with the IMF.
      </para>
      <para>
       Overall, while individual oil-importing developing countries will probably continue to experience severe debt problems, the major international organisations are taking ameliorating action to assist those countries to maintain essential development programs while adjusting to changed international circumstances. The importance of appropriate adjustment policies by the oil-importing countries themselves is better appreciated, and the problem, while serious, has not yet taken on the proportions of a crisis. Indeed, there has been some recent stabilisation in the oil market, and this improvement could be maintained if adjustment policies are pursued by all oil-importing countries, developed as well as developing.

      <para>
       (1) I am aware that buoyancy vests are being imported from the United States of America. Information is not available on the number of owners of small boats in Australia using these vests.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Buoyancy vests may be used for a variety of purposes including such activities as boating, sailing, water skiing, fishing, marine construction and bridge building. Not all of these activities are regulated by legislation. I am advised that there are requirements concerning the carrying of buoyancy vests in State and Territory boating legislation administered by various harbour and marine board and police authorities around Australia, but that there are variations in that legislation as to whether the buoyancy vests are to meet the requirements of the Australian Standard A.S. 1499-1979, be marked with the Standards Association of Australia certification mark or be of an approved type.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Buoyancy vests manufactured to meet the requirements of A.S. 1499-1979 are to be marked with certain information including the intended body mass range that the vest has been designed to support. The body mass ranges specified in A.S. 1499-1979 are in metric terms. Vests manufactured to meet U.S. requirements show the body mass range in imperial terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, I can initiate action to prohibit the supply of certain unsafe consumer products under the Trade Practices Act. Similar action can be taken to ban unsafe imports under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. If clear evidence is made available to me that unsafe buoyancy vests are coming onto the Australian market, I will take appropriate action.

      <para>
       (1) Has it been suggested that a motive for the possible mergers of the National Bank with the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney and of the Bank of New South Wales with the Commercial Bank of Australia is an expectation by local banks of increased and fierce competition in the near future form foreign banks.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is it a fact that the Government could announce now that it will not allow the entry of foreign banks into the mainstream Australian banking system whatever the recommendation on this subject by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Will the Government make this announcement at the same time as refusing consent for the mergers so that the fears of Australian banks that foreigners will be allowed into the system to take an easy profit will be removed and there will be no decline in the branch banking services offered to small customers in the present system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Have his announcements given the strong impression that he will not refuse consent for the mergers with the result that investors have been encouraged to go ahead and facilitate the mergers, with consequent adverse effects on employment and banking services particularly for small businesses.

Before doing so, I discussed with the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System whether it would be possible to accelerate that part of the Committee's report dealing with competition in the banking system so that the Government might have before it that section of the report at the time the decision was taken on the two merger proposals. For reasons particularly related to the interdependence of various sections of the report, the Chairman informed me that he did not think it practicable to report separately on that aspect of the Inquiry. I fully understand his reasons for that conclusion.

       More generally, the Government will be considering the recommendations and supporting argumentation of the Inquiry, including in respect of foreign bank entry, on their merits when the Inquiry's report is received.

      <para>
       (1) The interest rate on RCD loans applicable to the Australian Wheat Board between 8 December 1980 and 26 March 1981 was 10.5 per cent per annum.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Australian Wheat Board's commercial borrowings are obtained almost wholly through the issue of bank bills and promissory notes. The cost of each issue is set by reference to the bank bill rate available in the market on the day of issue plus a margin. In the three months period prior to the March increase in RCD rates, bank bill and promissory note rates paid by the Wheat Board were in the range of 12.1 per cent pa to 15.95 per cent pa.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Under the provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1979 the Commonwealth reimburses the Australian Wheat Board for the difference between the cost of commercial borrowings and the cost if those borrowings had been obtained from RCD. Each drawdown and rollover of Wheat Board bills and notes on any particular day normally involves the issue of a mix of bank bills and promissory notes for different amounts and maturities at different rates of interest. The amount of the reimbursement is calculated separately for each individual issue on the basis of the difference between the amount of interest paid on each individual issue and the amount of interest that would have been paid if that issue had been financed from RCD. Interest rate differentials are not recorded since payments of subsidy are calculated on the basis of amounts of interest paid.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) The interest rate on RCD loans applicable to the Australian Wheat Board was increased on 26 March 1981 to 11.5 per cent per annum, on 15 May 1981 to 12.25 per cent per annum and on 22 June 1981 to 13.25 per cent per annum.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Between the 26 March increase in RCD rates and 30 June 1981, bank bill and promissory note rates paid by the Wheat Board have been in the range of 14.85 per cent pa to 16.9 per cent pa.

      <para>
       (6) In my answer to questions 4 (a) and 4 (b) I detailed the changes in RCD interest rates and bank bill rates since the March RCD interest rate increase. The Reserve Bank has the statutory responsibility to determine RCD interest rates, although the practice has been established for the Treasurer of the day to be consulted. As part of this consultative process, I formally conveyed to the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 27 May 1981 the Government's decision on 15 April 1981 that the differential between the interest rate on commercial borrowings by the Australian Wheat Board and the rate charged for advances to the Board by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank should be reduced by one percentage point. The decision to increase RCD interest rates on 22 June 1981 which was taken by the Reserve Bank, took into account the Government's decision.

       (2) The final report was submitted in December 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The principal recommendation of the study was that the replacement for the Carpentaria Shoal light vessel should be an unmanned fixed structure equipped for automatic operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The principal recommendation made by the consultants was not accepted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The consultants stated that a light vessel would not meet the Department's standard with respect to both the luminous and geographic range. Since the consultants' report was prepared, a light vessel has been developed, and proved in service, which meets this standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       The consultants' report suggested that if a fixed structure were placed at Carpentaria Shoal, it might reduce the navigational dependence on the Booby Island station to a degree where this station could be unmanned. On this basis, in their economic analysis, the consultants added in to the costs of the light vessel option costs associated with the manning of the Booby Island station. The question of manning the Booby Island station is however entirely separate from the issue of deciding the type of replacement aid for Carpentaria Shoal.
      </para>
      <para>
       The consultants based their analysis on two new light vessels being required, the vessels being exchanged at the station site at periodic intervals. The Government is proposing that only one light vessel be purchased for Carpentaria Shoal, and that the new vessel will be relieved for periodical short maintenance periods by an existing light vessel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No detailed studies have been carried out by the Department of Transport on the relative costs of light vessels and fixed structures in general. In this particular case the consultants' report was examined in depth. This examination revealed that use of a new light vessel on Carpentaria Shoal would be the most economical approach.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) There is no contractual arrangement between the Department and AGA for the construction of light vessels. A $2.4m contract was placed with an Australian shipbuilding company in June 1981 for the supply of two light vessels. The placing of this contract has however required an amount of $58,701 to be paid to AGA in respect of design rights, documentation and royalties. The previous Director of Navigational Aids left the Department in February 1981.

       (1) Yes.
      </para>

      <para>
       (3) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) and (5) Unlike pensions, where there is a common payday, there is no single payday for unemployment, sickness and special benefit, the payday for each individual being directly related to the day on which his benefit was granted. Consequently, when the rate of benefit is increased each May and November the increase is not paid to all beneficiaries from a single day.
      </para>
      <para>
       In general, unemployment benefits are paid in arrears and sickness benefits in advance. If the increases were to be applied from 1 May and 1 November this would advantage some beneficiaries. However, a larger number of beneficiaries-those paid in arrears-would be disadvantaged. For example, if the payday is 2 May, only two days would be paid at the increased rate whereas under existing arrangements the full instalment is paid at the increased rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additionally, the administrative implications of adopting the suggested procedure would be significant. Given existing facilities, it would be necessary to process the majority of benefit instalments manually for the two periods concerned and staff resources to do this are not available.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. A letter was received by my Department from the Queensland Department of Health in July 1980, attached to which were the results of 25 analyses performed on blended tea. The letter was referred to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals (Standing) Committee (PACSC) for consideration. It was that Committee's opinion that the pesticide levels detected were low.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The results of the analyses carried out by the Queensland Government Chemical Laboratory did reveal the presence of some organochlorine compounds in the tea. These compounds include DDE, DDD, DDT, BHC and Chlordane.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Regarding the food and drug regulations in Queensland covering residues in tea, I quote from the then Queensland Minister for Health's press release of 11 July 1980: 'At present maximum residue limits are fixed for a range of pesticides in tea. But the Queensland survey . . . has disclosed other pesticides not allowed under Food and Drug regulations. The pesticides discovered in the tea were Aldrin, Dieldrin, DDE, DDD, DDT and BHC'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Disclosure of the names of teas, which on analysis showed residues in the Queensland Government survey, is a matter for that State's authorities and it would be inappropriate for them to be released by the Commonwealth Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The range of residues found in the teas were:
      </para>
      <para>
       BHC-not detected to 0.079 mg/kg of tea, Aldrin-not detected to 0.024 mg/kg of tea, Dieldrin-not detected to 0.004 mg/kg of tea, Chlordane-not detected to 0.24 mg/kg of tea, DDE-not detected to 0.007 mg/kg of tea, DDD-not detected to 0.013 mg/kg of tea, DDT-not detected to 0.033 mg/kg of tea.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Enforcement of regulations relating to pesticides and their residues in foods, including tea, is not a Commonwealth matter but a matter for the State/Territory authorities. Market Basket Surveys conducted by the NH&amp;MRC over recent years on foods purchased in the six State capitals have shown that pesticide residues in tea are minimal.

       (1) and (2) I have read the newspaper report referred to as well as the text of the address by Mr Weinberger on 5 May 1981 in Chicago. Mr Weinberger's address did not contain either by statement or implication the concepts reported in the Courier-Mail report referred to by the honourable member. Mr Weinberger did not refer at all to B-52 landings, communications or joint exercises with Australia. Contrary to the assertion in the Courier-Mail that Mr Weinberger 'called on Japan to increase its defence spending so Australia could help protect the eastern approaches to the Persian Gulf', what Mr Weinberger actually said was 'What Japan does to strengthen its defences enhances our (i.e. the United States') ability to fulfil our treaty obligations to Australia and New Zealand. What Australia and New Zealand contribute to safeguarding the eastern approaches to the Indian Ocean increases our capabilities and NATO's to counter any coercive threats on NATO's distant flanks-Turkey and Norway.'

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I announced the Reviews referred to by the honourable member on 13 November 1979. They were conducted in 1980 and the Reports were received in November 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) It was my intention to table the Reports during the Autumn period of sittings. However some of the recommendations of the Reports come within the terms of reference of the recently announced Defence Review. The Government decided therefore to refer the Reports to the Defence Review. That body has now identified a number of recommendations it wishes to consider.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rather than delay action on the remaining recommendations I have therefore released the Reports and the Government's response to those recommendations not being considered by the Defence Review, I tabled the Reports on 19 August 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) My Department did not indicate the Reports would be tabled but stated that it was expected that this would be the case. Subsequently the Government decided to refer the Reports to the Defence Review.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The reviews make a number of comments on the efficiency and detailed research being undertaken by DSTO. Some are favourable, some critical. They identified deficiencies in the organisation, management administration and operations of the DSTO which the Government is anxious to see remedied.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member can be assured that the Government has no intention of taking any action with regard to the DSTO without the long term defence needs of Australia well in mind. It is in this spirit that we have responded to the recommendations of both reviews.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       There are two ASEAN industrial co-operation programmes-the 'ASEAN Industrial Projects' and the 'ASEAN Industrial Complementations Schemes'; which have been endorsed by the ASEAN Governments to stimulate intra-ASEAN trade and industrial co-operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ASEAN Industrial Projects are large plants involving investments of the order of US$250-350 million owned jointly by the five ASEAN member countries. As originally proposed, the ASEAN Industrial Projects would produce the entire region's needs for given products and each ASEAN member would give adequate market support to these products through, for example, guaranteed purchases and tariff preferences. To date four Projects have been accepted; amonia-urea fertiliser plants in Aceh (Indonesia) and Bintulu (Malaysia), rock salt-soda ash plant probably in Laem Chabang (Thailand), and a copper fabrication plant in the Philippines. Stages of implementation vary from tenders being sought for construction of the plant in Indonesia, to feasibility study in the case of that proposed for the Philippines.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other potential areas under study include: metal-working, machine tools, fisheries, electrolytic tin plating, heavy duty rubber tyres, television picture tubes and electronic components.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ASEAN Industrial Complementation Schemes envisage a number of schemes for the manufacture of different products within an industry, or industries in the ASEAN countries. As with the ASEAN Industrial Projects, products are to be exchanged principally within the ASEAN region on a commercial basis supported by preferential trading arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Basic Agreement on ASEAN Industrial Complementation was approved by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Manila in June 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       The text of the new agreement records the desire of ASEAN Governments to provide guidelines and institutional arrangements within which the governments and the private sector can collaborate to identify opportunities, formulate programs etc for pursuing industrial complementation on the basis of mutual and equitable benefits for member countries and increased industrial production for the region as a whole. In brief, the agreement provides that each country participating in a particular complementation package will be granted exclusivity privileges in respect of certain products allocated to it under the package. Where these products are already being manufactured within ASEAN, other participants may not set up new production facilities or expand existing ones for a period of two years. Where products are new to ASEAN, the exclusivity privileges extend for four years. Such limitations would not apply in cases where 75 per cent of new or expanded production by other participants is intended for export outside the ASEAN region. Products identified under complementation packages are to qualify for preferences in accordance with the ASEAN Agreement on Preferential Trading Arrangements (PTA) and special preferences outside the PTA may also be granted during the period of exclusivity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first complementation package to be agreed by ASEAN Governments under the new arrangement relates to the production of components for the automotive industry. It is understood that products have been allocated as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Indonesia: diesel engines (80-135HP); motor cycle axles; wheel rims for motor cycles.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I assume this part of the honourable member's question also refers to domestic airline terminals. The position would differ from country to country. However, in the United States, airports are generally owned by local government authorities who in general provide the terminals. In the United Kingdom, airports, including terminals, are provided by Government or local government authorities. A similar situation prevails in Canada.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Detailed information of the type requested is not available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Private ownership of terminals in Australia is by the airlines or through finance companies under lease back arrangements to an airline (see answer to (5) below). The costs associated with the operation and maintenance of terminals would be budgeted for by the airlines in the normal way but there would be no offsetting revenue (other than through fares) and thus no concept of return on funds employed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The ultimate effect of a sale of a terminal on fares would depend on many factors and would be impossible to predict at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Some domestic terminals on Commonwealth airports have been provided by the private sector on sites leased from the Commonwealth pursuant to the provisions of the Airports (Business Concessions) Act 1959. The terminals concerned are:

      <para>
       (1) No. It is assumed that the passage referred to is the following:
      </para>
      <para>
       'On the basis of CPI data, Australia's inflation rate over the year to the March quarter 1981 was about one and a half percentage points below the OECD average, while on the basis of private consumption deflators, Australia's inflation rate over the year to the December quarter 1980 (the most recent available data) was about half a percentage point below the inflation rate in the major seven industrialised countries. The CPI data are thought to overstate Australia's relative advantage and a comparison of personal consumption deflators is believed to provide a more reliable indication as to relative inflation rates.'
      </para>
      <para>
       The over-statement referred to in the final sentence quoted above reflects a number of factors, including the following:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) The CPI in the United States gives a large weight to mortgage interest rates. When interest rates are rising sharply, as in 1980, this results in increases in the CPI running ahead of price rises generally. The United States of course has a substantial weight in the OECD average.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The average CPI for the OECD membership as a whole includes several countries (e.g. Turkey, Iceland and Greece) which have been recording very high rates of inflation but which are of limited relevance to assessments of Australia's international competitiveness.
      </para>
      <para>

       (3) Basic data on aquifer behaviour is being provided through the Commonwealth/States water resources assessment program, toward which the Commonwealth has provided approximately $60m since 1964, including some $9.3m last year. Relevant research is being carried out by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, CSIRO and State water agencies, in some instances in close co-operation with private industry. Details are available in successive editions of the Inventory of Water Resources Research published by the Australian Government Publishing Service for my Department of behalf of the Australian Water Resources Council. A conference to review groundwater recharge organised by my Department on behalf of the Australian Water Resources Council in Townsville last year concluded that much of the work necessary to understand groundwater recharge is already being carried out and knowledge is improving.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The States are responsible for the assessment, development and management of water resources, including studies associated with prospective resource development projects within their own boundaries. As evident over a period of years State water agencies are working in close co-operation with private industry to ensure that where there is potential for resource development projects in outback regions, lack of water resources information will not delay their implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes. However, there is no situation in Australia comparable to the over-exploitation of the vast Ogallala Aquifer formation in Kansas, USA. As acknowledged in the ASTEC report, Australia places lesser demands on its water resources than most other developed countries, and I have no reason to believe that groundwater resources are not being properly managed by the State authorities.

       (1) The current levels of liability for domestic operators under the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 are $45,000 in respect of death or injury to passengers, $300 for loss or damage to registered baggage and $30 for loss or damage to baggage in passengers' own care. In 1959 the levels of liability set down by the Act for death or injury to passengers and loss or damage to both registered baggage and baggage in the passengers' own care were #7,500, #100 and #10 respectively. These levels of liability were subsequently converted to $15,000, $200 and $20 in 1966 following the introduction of decimal currency. Following a review in 1970 the levels of liability were increased to $30,000, $300 and $30 respectively and in 1976 the domestic limit for death or injury to passengers was further increased to $45,000 to bring it into line with the level generally applying internationally.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The current levels of liability are presently under review. It is considered that the domestic liability limits should generally keep pace at least with domestic economic conditions and public expectations.

       (2) The practice followed in these matters by my department reflects my view that it is appropriate for backbenchers in Government-held electorates to announce local grants or funding approved by the Government of which they are a part. I am not aware of any instances where Opposition members have approached me or my department wishing to announce such grants. I would, indeed, be rather surprised to hear that the Opposition was anxious to announce Government initiatives, and would certainly not think it appropriate for them to do so.
