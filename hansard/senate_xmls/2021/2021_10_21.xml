                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory, approval for Empire Energy Group to frack the Beetaloo was recklessly stitched up yesterday afternoon. Today is the last sitting day for the Senate before the PM goes to Glasgow and embarrasses Australia on the world stage by not only refusing to lift 2030 targets but by expanding coal and gas fields. Yesterday, on the eve of world leaders descending on Glasgow to lift the 2030 targets, the Northern Territory Labor government approved fracking and to open the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is urgent; there is nothing more urgent or more important for this Senate to debate today. The federal government, with the support of the opposition, voted to give $50 million to gas companies and donors so that mining interests could take precedence over traditional owners' rights to their land and safe groundwater. In August of this year, the Ngandji, Yanuwa, Garawa, Jingili, Mudburra and Alawa nations came to this place to vent their fury to the federal government for the fast-tracking of gas fracking on their country instead of helping Indigenous people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Beetaloo basin is important in the climate fight, because the basin is so massive. It would cause the single biggest jump in Australia's pollution, and the Northern Territory government has said it will blow Australia's emissions up by a staggering six per cent a year. We need to suspend standing orders right now and debate this motion today, our last sitting day, because we need to hold this government to account. Gas is as dirty as coal, and the Beetaloo gas project will be worse for the climate—worse than the Adani coalmine, which itself is a climate bomb. Our climate crisis is the most existential threat to our wellbeing, and the wellbeing of all life on this planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new Labor climate bomb threatens our chance of stopping global warming. Scientists say no more coal and gas, but Labor isn't listening. We have been drawing attention to our climate crisis all week but still haven't got any sense out of this government about how on earth they can justify going to Glasgow without a commitment to slash our carbon pollution by 2030. After this announcement, it's clear that the only way we'll get climate action is to kick the Liberals out and put the Greens in the balance of power, where we'll push the next government to actually take this climate crisis seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's carbon emissions could increase as much as 23 per cent from this project, which is a slap in the face for all Australians who are fighting every day for the climate. This is urgent because, you know what, the government can't justify their climate denialism. After the Juukan Gorge disaster, you would have thought that the government, in this place, would listen to traditional owners. But we see, time and time again, Labor siding with their mates in the coalition. Traditional owners fear that chemicals used in the processes could contaminate their ground water. This comes directly from the traditional owners, who have told us in inquiries this is what's going to happen. These are the skies, the water and the land that must be protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott Morrison gifted the Beetaloo exploration drilling grants in March to help speed up gas production in this region, while here we are in the middle of a climate crisis. Shame! The basin is one of five gas fields the Commonwealth government plans to develop for the gas-led recovery of the COVID-19 crisis, which I don't know how they could even justify. The government said that the money would be better spent on housing, education, health and opportunities to lift Aboriginal people out of the grinding poverty inflicted on many of them. Beetaloo traditional owner Johnny Wilson told a Senate inquiry into oil and gas exploration and production: 'I still live in a tin shack. My floor is bare ground. When will I get money for housing? When do I get a house?' He said that many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory were struggling to access basic services in their communities. All week the Greens have been calling to debate the carbon targets that our Prime Minister is taking on our behalf to Glasgow in just 10 days time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  This is the fourth time we've had a suspension motion moved by the Greens, and Labor has supported the suspension on each of those occasions. The motion before the Senate that the Greens seek to debate today is just another demonstration of the desire of the Greens to keep the climate wars going in their political interest, as opposed to actually doing something in the national interest. The Greens political party, as a protest movement, have made it clear that they want to stoke division on every side—they want to have a go at them; they want to have a go at us. The actions they took 10 years ago to vote down an ETS, they have not learned a thing from. In 2019, when they did their convoy and picked fights wherever they went, that worked so well, didn't it? That worked really well. That delivered the outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a week where we have this government fighting itself, tearing itself apart—the chaos, the disunity—the Senate should be putting pressure on this government to actually get a position to take to Glasgow on behalf of the nation, but the Greens political party come in here and want to pick a fight with everybody, all for their social media. This is not about an outcome, not about the national interest, nothing like that. Labor will support the suspension so that this chamber can debate a matter of national importance that is front of and centre of every member of this chamber's mind; we do agree with that. What we disagree with, fundamentally, is the way that the Greens conduct themselves around this debate. It's all about their political interest, all about continuing the fights, not resolving everything, not having a position, not bringing people together, not having a consensus view, not putting the pressure on the government; it's all about trying to pick a fight with the Labor Party. Again, as I said yesterday, it didn't work so well in 2013, it didn't work in 2016, it didn't work in 2019, so how about the Greens reflect on the way they conduct yourselves and actually work in the national interest, as opposed to their narrow political interest. It hasn't worked. Picking a fight with people who want to deliver real action on climate change is not going to work. The Greens membership might endorse this approach, but they need to think a bit more broadly about the matters of this nation. Do their membership need the Greens picking a fight with the Labor Party every morning at the beginning of the sitting week? I would submit that that is not the most constructive way to pursue this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is that the division, the disunity and the chaos of the government in its inability and Mr Morrison's inability to lead his government and resolve his position two weeks out from climate should be the focus of this chamber. The single focus should be on having a government that actually can represent the Australian people in two weeks time. At the moment we don't have that. That should be the matter that this chamber is trying to resolve, not trying to blow up everything and pick a fight with everybody and run a political campaign in your narrow political interests, because that is what you're doing. We support the suspension. We support the ability of the chamber to discuss the matters raised around net zero by 2050 and the position that the government should be taking to Glasgow, so we do support that. We do not support the way the Greens conduct this debate or the divisive motions they move in this chamber at the beginning of business every single morning. It's tired, it's lazy, and it won't get them anywhere.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and a related bill. Labor will be supporting the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement implementation bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The partnership, RCEP as it is known, was signed on 15 November 2020 by 15 countries. It is a partnership that includes the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; as well as five non-ASEAN nations: Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. These countries make up 29 per cent of world GDP and 30 per cent of the world's population. RCEP is, quite simply, the biggest trade agreement in history. Negotiations for it started in 2012 at the 21st ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the negotiations were commenced by Labor, by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and trade minister Craig Emerson on behalf of Australia. From the beginning, Labor has supported Australia being actively involved in the negotiation of this partnership. Importantly, the process has been led by ASEAN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RCEP includes nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners and economies, which account for more than half of Australia's total two-way trade and more than two-thirds of our exports. Ratifying RCEP will mean Australia is part of the biggest trade agreement in the world. As Dr Jeffrey Wilson of the Perth USAsia Centre has argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">RCEP will be the world's second-most important trade agreement on arrival, ranking behind only the WTO itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, RCEP creates new regional architecture for economic integration and strengthens the rules of many of Australia's existing free trade agreements. Importantly, RCEP includes core investment protections—rules requiring payment of compensation where an investment is expropriated; minimum standards of treatment of investors under international law; and compensation for losses due to conflict and civil strife. The agreement provides avenues for reducing non-tariff barriers, including in areas such as quarantine and technical standards, by promoting compliance with World Trade Organization rules and further improving cooperation and transparency. And, finally, it supports economic capacity building and, in particular, provides a dedicated chapter addressing the capability of small and medium enterprises in the region to benefit from the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These protections and transparency provisions will provide greater certainty and confidence for Australian businesses looking to invest in the region, and they will be helped by the partnership's single set of rules for exporters to use, rather than having to rely on the multiplicity of different rules and procedures under the existing free trade agreements. This cuts or simplifies a great deal of red tape for Australian SMEs and opens up opportunities for Australian firms looking to utilise regional supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are aspects of the RCEP that we think could be better, and valid concerns have been raised, and I propose to go through some of these. RCEP, as it stands, does not have an environment chapter or labour chapter. When Labor was last in government, Craig Emerson, as trade minister, sought to include these provisions. Regrettably, other RCEP members were not amenable to this, but opting out and retreating to the sidelines was not an option, and to do so would have set back our relationship with ASEAN significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of other concerns have been addressed, including ensuring that the partnership does not expand waivers of labour market testing for foreign workers. Further, the government has provided assurances that RCEP does not restrict domestic procurement arrangements in Australia at any level of government; it does not require privatisation of any Australian public services; it does not undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it does not undermine state or Commonwealth workplace laws or occupational licensing arrangements; it does not undermine Australia's antidumping regime; it does not include provisions that limit the right of the Commonwealth to regulate in the interests of public welfare or in relation to safe products; and RCEP does not include investor-state dispute settlement provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor commends the work of civil society and the trade union movement in steering the government away from implementing ISDS as a basis for dispute settlement in all trade negotiations. The fact that we are seeing ISDS less and less in our international treaties is a testament to the campaigning of the ACTU, AFTINET and other organisations. Recent media reports that Clive Palmer is exploring the use of ISDS mechanisms to sue the Australian government reaffirm our opposition to them as a general provision in international trade deals. Having already forked out a million dollars in legal fees because the Prime Minister supported Mr Palmer's attempt to sue Western Australia, Australian taxpayers certainly don't want to be stung again by another vexatious suit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions and other civil society stakeholders have also expressed concern regarding the potential for public regulation to be constrained under RCEP. DFAT and Minister Tehan have clarified this is incorrect and that there are reservations in RCEP, like in any FTA, that allow Australia to regulate in the public interest, which includes for aged care or climate change action. Labor doesn't support agreements which would inhibit the government's ability to implement in full the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While aged care and other concerns have been responded to by the government and resolved, the Morrison-Joyce government still needs to respond to community concerns in relation to Myanmar. Myanmar, as an ASEAN nation, is a signatory to RCEP, but the actions of the Tatmadaw to undermine Myanmar's democracy, to detain thousands of political prisoners and to crack down against peaceful protests and opposition are unacceptable. They are completely unacceptable. Labor condemns the military coup of 1 February and the subsequent violence engaged in by the Tatmadaw. On 2 February, we called for the Australian government to review its military cooperation with the Tatmadaw, and over a month later this cooperation was suspended. Labor has also called for targeted sanctions against those responsible for the coup. In April, Labor called on the government to provide visa pathways for at-risk Myanmar nationals to remain in Australia. Once again, a month later, the government said those on temporary visas could apply to extend their stay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Morrison-Joyce government has still not implemented any additional targeted sanctions against those responsible for the coup and for human rights abuses in Myanmar. This is despite many of our like-minded partners taking strong action, and it is despite the government chaired Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade recommending sanctions against the Tatmadaw in June, and, in August, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties embarrassingly having to remind the Morrison-Joyce government again of the need to act. Labor members of the JSCOT worked hard to amend the final report to reflect stakeholder concerns on Myanmar. I thank all of the Labor members, and I especially thank Senator Ayres and the deputy chair, Mr Khalil, for their tireless efforts in this committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the committee's report, the government was urged to make a declaration as to Australia's response to the situation in Myanmar at the time of RCEP ratification. All the minister has indicated is that he will consider it. Well, we say the time for consideration has well passed, given ratification is assured with the passage of the bill today. We urge the government to make a declaration, as the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties urged. More broadly, the Morrison government's refusal to implement any sanctions since the coup sends precisely the wrong message. It sends a message that we don't care and that we are mere bystanders to the democratic backsliding in our region, in a nation where many Australians over many years have worked so hard to support Myanmar's democratic transition. So it is time for Mr Morrison and Minister Payne to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison-Joyce government's failings on Myanmar reflect their broader failings to understand the region and to sufficiently deploy our diplomacy to shape the region we want: a region that is stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty. Labor recognises that Australia's security and prosperity relies on our continued economic engagement with the world and engagement and integration with our region, including through trade and investment. International trade creates jobs. These are facts that sometimes some in this chamber and some in the community fail to recognise. One in five Australian workers are employed in a trade related activity. That is more than 2 million Australian jobs. As an open trading nation, Australia has not just been a beneficiary of the multilateral rules based system that has operated for decades; we have helped shape it and we have worked to shape it for our interests. We have to understand that our recovery and the region's recovery from the pandemic requires open trade based on agreed rules of the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, our ongoing success as an exporting nation also demands that we better diversify what we export and where we export. Despite all of his tough talk, Prime Minister Morrison has overseen Australia becoming more dependent than ever on one market—that is, China—for our exports and for Australian jobs, such that we depend on the Chinese market more than any other country in the world. Under Mr Morrison's prime ministership, trade with India and Indonesia has gone down. When trade diversification should be the highest priority for this nation, Mr Morrison has put at risk our trade agreement with the European Union. We all know, in the context of his flashy announcement on nuclear powered submarines, that Mr Morrison neglected to do any of the diplomatic legwork around ending Australia's contract for the Attack class submarines with the French. It really highlights how perilous it is for Australia, for our economy and for the national interest to have a man in the office of Prime Minister who really only cares about the photo-op and the politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade diversification and more open trade are in our national interest. Our economic welfare, our strategic opportunities, our national security and our cultural dynamism will all depend on how deeply and well we integrate with the fast-growing economies of Asia not only in traditional goods trade but also in investment, tourism, services, supply chains and people-to-people links.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is so often lost in the trade discussion in this country is a recognition of the benefits that open trade has for working people. Trade benefits working people by contributing to economic growth. Trade benefits working people by improving national productivity. Trade benefits working people because it creates better-paid, more-rewarding and more-secure jobs. It benefits working people by offering lower prices and greater choice for working people as consumers. You see, we don't pursue trade opportunities out of blind adherence to abstract theories; we in the Labor Party pursue it because it delivers real benefits for the people we represent. Trade raises living standards, so, because I am a progressive, I support trade and I support free trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I also recognise trade places uneven pressures on our society. That is why we have to have proper social democratic institutions and progressive economic policies, and it means existing on high-quality trade agreements that maximise local employment. It means ensuring that trade agreements do not undermine public policy—for example, in the areas of health care, environment or labour rights. It means trade agreements must be supported by policies that have at their heart the expansion of opportunity and investments in health, education, innovation and infrastructure to ensure the Australian people continue to prosper in a more open economy. This combination of open trade supported by the government investing in its people is central to how we ensure Australia and working Australians can be the beneficiaries of a changing region and a changing world.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. These two bills implement Australia's obligation under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, RCEP for short. The agreement was signed between Australia and 14 other states: China, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the 10 members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations—Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens won't be supporting these bills, as we oppose binding treaty action being taken. As is consistent with our approach to free trade agreements, we continue to hold serious concerns around the transparency, consultation and human rights regarding trade agreements processes, as I will articulate further. There are no additional market access benefits for Australian exports that come out of the RCEP. Australia already has free trade agreements with the RCEP members. India's withdrawal from negotiations means that agreements offer no additional export markets for Australian businesses. Even the government acknowledges the minimum value of RCEP. The regulation impact statement prepared for this bill clearly states, 'Given the relative quality of Australia's existing free trade agreements with its RCEP partner parties, including the CPTPP, we do not expect that RCEP goods market access commitments to provide Australia with additional market access with our current free trade partners.' The government also acknowledges that under our existing free trade agreements, Australia will already have illuminated tariffs on imports from RCEP parties by 1 April 2021. So if there is neither additional market access nor any benefits in the form of a reduced tariffs, why is Australia entering into this agreement in the first place? The government has not commissioned an independent study of the economic or social costs and benefits that will come from this agreement, so we have no way of independently verifying the government's claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As is usual practice, RCEP trade negotiations were conducted in secret. Neither parliament nor the wider community have had any input into the development of this agreement. The final text of the agreement was not made public until after the government made a decision to sign it. While the community and civil society are kept in the dark, business groups get the advantage of having a seat at the table. The EU has developed a more open process when it comes to negotiating free trade agreements and that includes the public release of documents and proposed text used during those negotiations before they are signed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia can and should strive to have a more open process when it comes to our free trade negotiations. This includes not only the publication of our negotiating text but also the independent evaluation of the economic health, gender and environmental impact agreements before we make a decision to sign these agreements. The community and civil society should have a role in providing feedback through an open and transparent process. The RCEP contains no minimum requirements for a signatory government to uphold human rights, labour rights or environmental protections. This is entirely unacceptable when it comes to the context of the climate crisis, the significant human rights violations occurring in states who are signatories to the agreement and the inconsistent approach taken by signatory states to the implementation of labour basic rights as defined by the International Labour Organization.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, global trade models encourage competition to provide the lowest labour and environmental costs for exports. This model suits global corporations and big business but does come at the expense of labour rights, especially in low-income countries. We should be using trade agreements to improve the rights and conditions of workers, not eroding them. The absence of commitment to human rights and labour rights means there is no obligation on signatories to take action to end human rights abuses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greens echo the deep concern of AFTINET, the ACTU and others about entering an agreement with Myanmar. As noted by AFTINET, the RCEP would legitimise a brutal military regime in Myanmar at a time when the US and other allies are implementing serious sanctions and withdrawing from economic agreements with Myanmar. The RCEP also ignores violations of human rights and labour rights China, the Philippines and other RCEP countries. Australia should not be entering into preferential trade deals with Myanmar; we should be imposing targeted sanctions and showing our support for the return of the democratically elected government. The Greens strongly support the inclusion of our international labour standards and human rights standards as part of our free trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement also represents another missed opportunity to include commitments by governments to implement international environmental standards. This is not a new suggestion. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement includes the environmental chapter in which parties made commitments not to reduce environmental standards. The RCEP does not include an environmental chapter. This is a serious shortcoming in this agreement. We cannot afford to entrench bad climate policies and sell out workers rights through our trade models any longer. Now is the time to include enforceable commitments to climate action in our trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many concerns that have been raised with the RCEP, including rules on trades and services, as they will apply to aged care. The current rules freeze regulations at current levels for most services unless they are listed as exempt. Unlike other publicly funded essential services, aged care has not been specifically exempted from those rules. The Greens are deeply troubled that these rules will lock in current levels of regulation and restrict further changes. This places significant and unnecessary limitations on any government to be able to regulate in the public interest and could restrict the implementation of the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Our trade agreement should not restrict the provision of essential services like aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move now to the issues around investor-state dispute settlements. While the RCEP does not include investor-state dispute settlement provisions upon ratification, this will be considered two years after the agreement comes into force. These provisions allow foreign investors and corporations to bypass national courts and sue governments directly for compensation if a change in law harms their investment. They do not serve the interest of the community but instead protect the interests of multinational corporations. If investor-state dispute settlement clauses are agreed in the RCEP in the future, Australia could face both state-to-state disputes and ISDS disputes from international aged-care companies if it increases regulation, particularly in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RCEP provides no clear economic benefit to Australia. It fails the human rights test, the environmental standards test and the transparency test. For too long, free trade agreements have come at the expense of human rights, labour rights and environmental rights. I know that we can do better. We can implement free trade agreements grounded in democratic transparency and accountability to serve the interests of our communities, not greedy multinational corporations. I urge those in this chamber to stand with the greens in opposing the ratification of the RCEP.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>): I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. I want to make some comments from the perspective of my participation in the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties deliberations on the RCEP agreement. I want to thank those Labor senators and members who participated in that committee, who've done careful work in the labour interest, in the labour movement's interest and in the national interest to continually improve Australia's participation and the quality of these agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with a few facts. The debate about trade is too often a fact-free debate. The key issues that we prioritised in the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties were, firstly, the legitimate issues raised by people in aged care wanting to ensure that the impact of the RCEP wasn't to limit the Australian government's capacity to regulate in aged care. It is crystal clear that there is no impact from the RCEP on the capacity of the Australian government to regulate aged care if this government or a future Albanese government chooses to implement the full recommendations of the aged-care royal commission—no impact on labour mobility and the capacity to regulate temporary work, no investor-state dispute settlement procedures, and despite what we heard a few minutes ago, a commitment in writing from this government that is binding that Australia will not pursue investor-state dispute settlement procedures at the two-year review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues around Myanmar are a top priority for the Labor members of the committee, and in no way is Australia's participation in the RCEP a legitimisation of the Tatmadaw regime in Myanmar. It is an assertion of ASEAN centrality. And, if you're concerned about issues like the brutal takeover in Myanmar and you want a pathway to resolve those issues, ASEAN centrality is critical; collective action in the region is critical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have some criticisms of the government's approach to Myanmar. We on the Labor side do believe that a stronger statement at this point would be of value. We would support Magnitsky-style sanction regimes; they would allow more targeted, agile and effective sanctions of Tatmadaw figures. But in no way should Labor's support for the RCEP be taken as a tacit endorsement or legitimisation of that regime. Environment, labour and human rights are all provisions supported by Labor when we commenced negotiations for this agreement, and we will continue to seek improvements in those areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, our region is not composed of entirely democratic countries. That may be a newsflash for some people in this place. From some of the language about alliances with like-minded nations, it may be a newsflash for people in the government and in the Greens, but, you know what, the region's a bit more complicated than that. Diplomacy and seeking peace, freedom, relationships and security in our region involve deepening relationships with countries that are very different to ours and have very different styles of governance to us. And we should be focused on that. If you're interested in security and peace, that is the strongest argument, in fact. There is not a very strong economic argument for RCEP. Not even its principal opponents would argue that there are any significant advances in RCEP in economic terms or market access terms. The strongest argument for RCEP is continuing to build our relationships in the region. That is the strongest argument. If you're interested in peace and security in our region, you cannot be against our participation in the largest piece of regional architecture that has been developed in recent times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does lead me to make a couple of observations about the government's approach to trade agreements more broadly. It is the case that the government has, at the very least, overstated the economic case for each of the agreements that it has participated in and led. I think the closest the government's going to get to achieving net zero this week is RCEP, where there is net zero economic benefit—no real benefits, no real costs. They won't get much closer to net zero in any other terms this week. There is no independent economic analysis, and it is a problem for building confidence in the Australian community that the government's secret deals approach to trade agreements is actually in the national interest when the government cannot demonstrate one extra job from its trade agreements—in fact, the reverse. There have been too many cows-for-cars agreements. There have been too many agreements that privilege the export of raw commodities and don't actually act in the interests of jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been forced further down the global value chain over the life of this government and become less and less economically diverse. You have jokers like Mr Christensen chairing this Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, worried about our economic diversity—the diversity of our trading relationships. If you were remotely interested in Australia's economic sustainability and diversity, you would be focussed on lifting us up the global value chain and making our economic exports more complex, not less. What have we seen? We've seen the car industry close down. We've seen incomes decline. We have seen no wage growth. This is because of the free market ideology that's attached to the government's approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of the government's approach that is a problem here is a focus on ribbon-cutting and announcements and not delivery. That's why you see people performing and putting a big amount of emphasis on agreements like the Uruguay agreement. Our trade volume with Uruguay is $24 million, at its highest, a year, but we devoted resources to pursuing an agreement with Uruguay. The IA-CEPA is the most recent significant bilateral agreement. It was supported through this place by the Labor Party. There was a big announcement and all the razzle-dazzle, all the press conferences, all the claims made about the economic benefit, but where is the follow-through from this government? Where is the increase in commitment to resources from trade offices to support Australian businesses to participate in economic activity in Indonesia? The short story is: nothing; zip. The government's focus is on the instrument itself and not the object. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, I think, a government that's approach to trade agreements has let Australia down, a government that's approach to trade agreements is stuck in the 1990s and the 2000s. We've slid much further. We are repeating the certainties and sureties of the 1980s and 1990s, and things have been allowed to slip, decline and deteriorate since then. What we see in the Australian community on issues like temporary migration, for example, is that there is an association in people's minds with the amount of temporary migration and the trade agreements. Well, the truth is trade agreements are now irrelevant in temporary migration terms; it's this government's approach to temporary migration that is the problem. There is no effective local training and no regulation of temporary migration. Former Treasurer Peter Costello said in the early 2000s that Australia would never become a guest worker nation. I don't think you could travel in the streets of Sydney or Melbourne, or in our agriculture sector, and say that that is still the case. There is a deep complacency that has infected the government's approach. It's still stuck in the early 2000s when we had, essentially, a benign economic environment and a benign geopolitical environment. With that complacency and that sense of confidence, the coalition government has not caught up with the big shifts in the region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What would be different about the Labor approach in government? Well, the first thing is that we would be results based—not measuring our effectiveness on the number of trade agreements or the number of press conferences, but having a focus on actually deepening trade and market access, particularly for Australian firms higher up in the value chain. We would be supporting businesses, rather than just signing the agreements and saying, 'Job done.' That has been the approach of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we would do to rebuild confidence in these issues is clean up temporary labour. We would be focused on permanent jobs and permanent migration and eliminate the abuses, the rorts and the rip-offs that have been perpetrated by this government in temporary labour. We should be prioritising permanent migration. We don't want a guest worker economy; we want to be supporting permanent migration. And for temporary workers who come here, their experience of life in Australia should be a good one. They should be able to come here and work in confidence and then be able to return to their countries and tell a good story of their lives in Australia, not a story of desperation and hunger and lining up in food queues, which has been the experience of temporary migrants over the last couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fix agriculture, train apprentices, look after temporary workers and make sure we actually recognise the soft diplomacy asset that there is in our region and look after Pacific workers properly when they come here, instead of the current approach of all care and no responsibility. What do you think people say when they return about their experience if there have been 14 people stuck in a flat in Inverell paying exorbitant rents and working in a meatworks? What do you think they say about the Australian government's commitment to the Pacific when that happens? We have to improve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be no ISDSs under a Labor government's trade approach. They are not in RCEP. They are a declining feature of the global trading environment, in any case. We will not permit them. There will be no agreements that undermine our sovereign capacity to provide and protect public services or to regulate in the interests of Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Albanese government will build local. We will use the power of our government procurement capability at the Commonwealth level and encourage the states to build locally. Just like President Biden, in the COVID recovery we will build back better and build Australian industry. That means more trains in Queensland, with no more Campbell Newman approaches to outsourcing or Mr Baird or Ms Berejiklian approaches, where all the trains, buses and ferries were built offshore. There'll be billions of dollars spent and local jobs in places like Maryborough and Newcastle. There'll be defence procurement, supporting our small to medium enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will rebuild Australian manufacturing under an Albanese Labor government. Under the government opposite, good jobs in manufacturing have declined. The car industry has gone offshore. Manufacturing now sits at 5.7 per cent of GDP. You can't wander around this place wittering on about national security and pretend that it's sustainable for Australia to be strong and secure in the region when our economy is diverse and hollowed out and manufacturing hovers just above five per cent. It's completely inconsistent, it's completely reckless and it will leave Australia a weaker and impoverished place if we allow it to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Albanese Labor government will support good-quality trade agreements, but we will not allow free trade ideology to capture our approach to industry policy or to regulating and protecting the Australian national interest.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and say that One Nation supports fair trade agreements. Is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement the spawn of the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Is it free trade or fair trade? It's certainly not free trade. Each of the signatories have carved out substantial areas of their economies from the agreement. This information is tucked away, hidden away in annexes where it would seem not enough have looked. Tariffs are being defended. Schemes that protect the power base of local politicians are being defended, at Australia's cost. There are hundreds of pages of carve-outs in this agreement. Many of them are ours. That's probably a good thing. But the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement is not a free trade agreement. It is at best slightly freer trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Productivity Commission submission dated July 2022 to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into certain aspects of the treaty-making process in Australia, the Productivity Commission comes out and basically supports what I'm about to say. The government prepared a national interest analysis on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement and found it did provide a net benefit to Australia. This was relied upon by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and subsequently endorsed by the Morrison-Joyce government and the alternative Albanese-Bandt government. This consensus of the establishment parties is disconcerting. Despite their name, free trade agreements are never free. These agreements always come at a cost to someone, and that's usually everyday Australians, workers and business owners. Underdeveloped countries do not sign free trade agreements with industrialised nations in order to give away what they have. It's the industrialised nations that give away their wealth, our wealth, through lower tariffs, greater market access of cheaper goods and greater incursion of foreign workers into our Australian economy. They're facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free trade in this situation is a race to the bottom. The nation with the worst environmental protections, the lowest wages, the worst working conditions, the crudest and most unsafe working conditions will win every time, in effect dragging our conditions down at the same time as dragging theirs up. Our environment loses. Our wages lose. Everyday Australians lose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw nothing in the National Interest Analysis that constituted a genuine attempt to identify who the winners and losers will really be. That's probably a design feature to allow the establishment parties to take all the electoral gain and protect themselves later from any electoral loss in this election cycle, because all too often in this country, in this parliament, it seems to be about looking good, not doing good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once signed into existence, these agreements are not subject to sufficient scrutiny. The last Productivity Commission inquiry into a free trade agreement was in 2010. The last review into Australia's most important free trade agreement, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, was in 2018. Before Australia enters into future trade agreements, this parliament must address the lack of transparency in the trade negotiation process and the signing of an agreement before this parliament ratifies it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next concern is to the new regulatory environment that this agreement will create. In his submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Bryan Clark from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry highlighted: 'There are five separate trade agreements with Malaysia. Businesses are getting very confused trying to work out how to use these agreements, and the best outcome for Australian business would actually come from sorting out all this red tape and creating clear rules for Australian businesses.' I agree completely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a specific example of this, thanks to the Australian Fair trade and Investment Network. The United Nations Central Product Classification system used by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement— with the UN it's always a mouthful, isn't it; they twist and turn and hide and bury and camouflage in acronyms and long titles that confuse people, so I'll start again. The United Nations Central Product Classification system used by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement has a separate classification for aged care, which implies that without a specific reservation by Australia any increase in the regulation of aged care would be a breach of this agreement. So if we find something we need to improve and regulate it, it could be a breach of this agreement. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association agreed that: 'At worst, aged care is exposed to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. At best, there is sufficient ambiguity to allow overseas companies to exploit the framework for their own benefit.' The globalists, the elites, moving our industries—whole industries, whole sectors, workers, farmers—as pawns in their game of 'central', of control and money, and parliaments in this country, without accountability, are their tool. They work through us—this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has responded that there is provision for a review of unexpected consequences so we should not worry aged-care standards will drop under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. There is, though, no framework in place to ensure this action actually occurs. In the years ahead, we will read stories that the parliaments' mates, be they union bosses or crony capitalists and globalists, are exploiting loopholes in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement for their own benefit. That's how they get through unaccountable parliaments. Resolving that will be at the discretion of the minister. This is a terrible system. The benefit of a free-trade agreement must be tested annually. I call on the government to introduce a system of annual review of the economic gains and losses for each of the agreements. Australia will not restore its position as a leading world economy by exposing Australian businesses to unfair competition and multiple layers of red, green and blue tape. Red tape is the bureaucracy. Green tape is pseudo-environmental regulations, impositions, under the guise of environment but really with the intent to control. And blue tape is UN policy on behalf of the UN's masters, the globalists, who move industries and people around the globe at will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will not emerge from our self-inflicted COVID-19 recession by destroying business and increasing reliance on government welfare. To restore the wealth of everyday Australians, we must get the government out of the way and let personal free enterprise create wealth again. Ideas, effort, energy, heart—that's what brings life to an economy when it is a free economy with fair trade. Fair trade has an important role to play in that process—fair trade.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. I want to make a few comments about trade policy and where RCEP fits in. For over 75 years the Liberal Party has largely been a champion of free trade. This goes back to the Menzies government opening up trade with Japan with the commerce agreement that was delivered in the 1950s. That led to, predominantly, iron ore being shipped to Japan. So the pivot to Asia—trade in an economic sense—started under the Menzies government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the current period of coalition government, you'd have to give great credit to prime ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison for pursuing an agenda on free trade which has seen us deliver the TPP, the RCEP and also bilateral agreements with a number of key Asian partners. The point of free trade is that it is about opening up markets for Australia. This is a wealthy country with a relatively small domestic market. Therefore, we depend on our ability to trade offshore to pay for our lifestyle. I've said many times that Australia has relied upon foreign people, foreign capital and access to foreign markets for the past 240 years. That is a fact. So the job of government is to ensure that the Australian people can trade into these markets., which we can now do at much greater rate thanks to these new trade deals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RCEP is setting Australia up for another generation of prosperity. It builds on the bilateral trade deal agenda. As we are trying to set up the country for a decarbonised economy, trade is a key economic lever. It's always easy to run an agenda against free trade through a protectionist lens but the reality is that we will not be a wealthy nation by selling stuff to ourselves—and that is the same for goods and services. What I like about the RCEP is that it goes beyond just cutting tariffs on goods; it also opens up the prospect of Australian services exports going into, mainly, the Asian region. It is important that we, as a diverse economy that is predominantly a services economy, can look to export financial services; that we can look to export accounting services, professional services; that we can look to export architecture and engineering through mutual recognition, through the creation of schemes that allow qualifications and regulatory systems to be recognised in other jurisdictions. We have a lot to gain from services exports as well as goods exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I will just make two points. The thing with these trade deals is that it really is the end of the beginning. Yes, it's true that the signing ceremonies and the media coverage are important. Getting the legislation through means that there will be, eventually, lower tariffs and more access for goods and services. But it is a real grind to get the gains of these trade deals, and that relies upon the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade engaging closely with industry and making sure that the real gains are being achieved, that we are getting access into these markets and that, when the cameras and the caravans and so on move on, the real work continues, because that is the key of a free trade deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, without risking being accused of being too partisan, I don't believe the Labor Party would have delivered these trade deals. They are too frightened of ISDS and union bogeyman. Unfortunately, Labor weren't able to deliver big trade deals with Japan and with China when they were in government. They weren't allowed to. Their union bosses said no. I hope in the future, if there is ever a Labor government, that they use their own brains and assess the relative merits of trade deals rather than being told what to think by people who aren't elected. But, in our case, we always act in the national interest. These are good developments, and I commend this legislation to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I will begin by taking up a couple of issues raised by the previous speaker, Senator Bragg, before I start on the substance of my speech. I always find it intriguing when Menzies gets mentioned, particularly when it comes to trade matters. I recall being taught at school that his nickname was 'Pig Iron Bob' because he fuelled, at that time, the non-democratic Japanese army's imperialistic intentions for the rest of Asia. So if you're trying to recite that one as an example of the successive capacity of the conservatives, it's certainly wanting. When it comes to the other comments that Senator Bragg made, I will deal with them in a moment. As the Senate would recall, it was Gough Whitlam, who was the Prime Minister at the time, who actually began the very important process of engaging with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. The RCEP countries include nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners, accounting for 58 per cent of our two-way trade and 67 per cent of our exports. It includes our near neighbours, the ASEAN countries; New Zealand; and major trade partners China, Japan and South Korea. The RCEP will provide a single set of basic rules for Australian exporters, including small businesses, to these countries. Labor support the measures that encourage small businesses to boost exports and create more Australian jobs as a result. Already, one in five Australian workers, more than two million people, are employed in a trade-related activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian exports will be an important feature of any economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and currently small and medium businesses only account for 14 per cent of Australia's exports, whereas the G7 average is 25 per cent and the European Union average is 35 per cent. Clearly there is more to be done to support small businesses in this country. Lifting small and medium business exports to 25 per cent of our exports would increase Australia's GDP by $36 billion. So there are potential economic benefits to the RCEP, which is why Labor cautiously supports the ratification of this treaty. But that support is not unqualified and it's not without our serious concerns. I'd like to thank the shadow minister for trade, Madeleine King, who has raised some of those concerns directly with the minister for trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of these concerns is that the potential economic benefits I've just outlined are exactly that: potential. The Morrison government has refused to commission independent economic modelling for the RCEP, despite being pressed by Labor to do it. It is unclear why Mr Morrison is so opposed to knowing the economic impact of his own treaty. It raises concerns that we do not truly know the economic and social impact that this will have, particularly on Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue raised by Labor is the use of investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS mechanisms. ISDS mechanisms give private companies the power to sue the Australian government when it exercises its democratic mandate to enact legislation. Famously, this was used by the tobacco giant Philip Morris to attempt to sue the Gillard government over the introduction of tobacco plain packaging laws. The Gillard government vowed to end the use of ISDS mechanisms and remove them from existing agreements in 2012. Since then, agreements signed by both the Abbott and Turnbull governments have reintroduced ISDS. I would love to hear how those on the other side would argue that it's in the best interest of the Australian people to give multinational companies like Philip Morris the power to sue the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RCEP, as currently drafted, does not have an ISDS provision. However, it could be added at a later stage. I understand that the Morrison government has said it does not intend to add an ISDS clause to the agreement at the two-year review. If Australia is unfortunate enough for this government to still be in charge at that point, I am certain that Labor will hold Mr Morrison to that promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another concern that Labor has consistently raised surrounds the actual treaty-making process. The RCEP, as with other agreements made by this government, was negotiated behind closed doors. The final treaty text was not publicly released until after Mr Morrison had signed up. That is fundamentally contrary to some of our major trading partners—for example, Europe—that have an ongoing process of engagement. Unlike Senator Bragg, we think talking to employers and unions that represent millions of workers in this country, and the aspirations of many more, is not a weakness in any process of making a trade agreement. In fact, it's a strength to make sure that an appropriate and proper trade agreement is put in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the public eye on those processes is critical to a final treaty that the public support. As we know, treaties have become discredited in some of the more populist public areas primarily because of the lack of transparency, and also some of the critical issues I've already raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just the latest long-running saga of Mr Morrison running away from transparency. Whether it's JobKeeper, the national cabinet, the widespread rorts or our trade agreements, this is a Prime Minister who prefers to operate outside of any public or parliamentary oversight. Like mould, like rot, he thrives in darkness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, Labor believes that greater transparency in the development of trade agreements is a good thing. We see transparency and openness as vital to developing a real public license to enter into these sorts of agreements. That public license is in danger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there have been economic benefits to trade liberalisation, there have also been victims. Workers in our manufacturing industry in particular have lost out as successive governments have made it easier and cheaper for production to be sent offshore. Workers across all sectors of the economy have lost out as big business, with the support of the Liberal Party, have used underpaid, temporary migrant labour to drive down wages for Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very valid concerns about the impact of the RCEP on Australian jobs, wages and conditions. Thankfully, the RCEP does not include commitments in relation to waiving labour market testing. It is absolutely essential that we do not go any further down that path. It is absolutely essential that we do not make it easier for big businesses to import and exploit cheap, temporary, migrant labour, because, when that happens, the impact is twofold. Firstly, it results of the sort of horrible exploitation we've seen time and time again—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is with a heavy heart that I have introduced this legislation to the Senate, a Bill for an Act to protect the right of Australians to make their own health decisions in relation to COVID-19 vaccination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I introduce this Bill because I see no other alternative for halting the pandemic of discrimination that has been unleashed in Australia against individuals who don't get vaccinated against COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's in the best Westminster tradition that I introduce this Bill to enshrine individual rights in law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Introducing this Bill is also a response to the disturbing trend of Australian prime ministers too frightened - or simply incapable - of exercising true leadership when their country is crying out for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are Australians just like you and me, with families and mortgages and worries and hopes and dreams.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The pandemic of discrimination which has been unleashed upon our fellow Australians has taken many forms.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are demonised by elected governments and unelected health bureaucrats, a message amplified by a disturbingly compliant and complacent media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are physically beaten by police for protesting vaccine mandates and hair-trigger lockdowns destroying their families, jobs, businesses and the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They have been attacked in parliaments by their own elected representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They face a bleak future in which they are treated as second-class citizens unable to enjoy whatever freedoms will be returned to us - freedoms we all took for granted before 2020, like going to a movie or on an interstate holiday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of these people have already lost their jobs and their livelihoods, with little to no prospects on the horizon.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many more jobs are under threat from this discrimination.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last week the Northern Territory government ordered people to receive a jab by 13 November if their jobs involved public interaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not content with this demand, people were told they would not be allowed at work without it and would be hit with a 5000 dollar fine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is pure, naked coercion - not only will you lose your job and your income for standing for your right to choose, but you will have your savings account cleaned out also, right when you need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In other words, do what you're told or we'll put you out on the street.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Or in prison, maybe, if you don't have 5000 dollars just lying around.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not a lot of Territorians do.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All this discrimination and coercion against people who won't be vaccinated against COVID-19, which has affected just over 200 people in the Territory and caused no deaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Influenza kills people in the Territory - one person died last year and five the year before - but similar discrimination and coercion is not in place for people who won't get a flu jab.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No, discrimination is being solely reserved for those who won't get the COVID-19 jabs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of this discrimination has amounted to one clear message: the rights of the individual will be protected only so long as they do not conflict with the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is nothing - not even a global pandemic - more dangerous to a free society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our nation's history is replete with people who recognised this danger and acted, from the miners who rebelled on the Victorian goldfields and the drafters of our Constitution, to the young men and women who enlisted to fight wars against fascist or communist tyranny and the legislators who passed landmark laws against racial and sexual discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our nation's history is also replete with the extension of equal rights to disenfranchised sections of Australian society - firstly men without property, then women, then indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation follows this proud tradition but, more importantly, will help prevent us from going backwards on protecting individual human rights in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation is all about principle, something which has been abandoned by the major political parties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There sit senators of the Labor Party, the so-called champions of the working class, the political arm of the union movement now under attack from its very own members for failing to stand up for their right to choose.</span>

                    </a>  The bipartisan Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation has an admirable track record of defending the Senate's duty as the house of review. The Australian people deserve nothing less. This motion results from subsection 476(2) of the Biosecurity Act 2015, which allows the minister to make the declaration of a pandemic without needing parliamentary approval. The minister may need to issue a pandemic declaration quickly, yet the parliament should come along afterwards and decide if that declaration was appropriate or not. The report that this motion is trying to shake loose is the government's response to the committee's recommendation that this regulation be made disallowable so that the parliament can do its job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to provide that a motion relating to the failure of the government to comply with an order for the production of documents may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business until determined, and be determined without amendment or debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this motion, the Senate may or may not recall that the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction was subject to an order for production of documents by motion of this chamber with which the government has not complied. The order for production was moved by Senator Canavan and Senator Patrick, and the requirement was that this be tabled by 10 am today. Unsurprisingly, for a government that avoids all accountability—as we saw in the House of Representatives yesterday, with the voting to protect Mr Christian Porter—this government has failed to comply with the provision of the modelling. It seems passing strange that a government that has spent so much of the last eight long years saying to people, 'You can't have a target without a plan; you can't have a target unless you know what it means,' is going to such lengths to hide the economic modelling it is doing, or has done, for its climate plan. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan has been rightly calling for the release of this modelling by his own government. We don't agree on very much, Senator Canavan and I, but we do agree on this. We do agree that the government should provide the modelling, and I remind the Senate of Senator Canavan's tweet on 19 October 2021: 'If this modelling is so good why does it have to remain a secret?' As everybody knows, Senator Canavan and I have different views on climate change, but what we do agree with is that this government shouldn't keep this a secret. The problem is that this government is addicted to secrecy, addicted to covering up and addicted to not providing information to this chamber. Time and again, the chamber calls for documents—calls for information—and we see the government refusing to provide them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same attitude that this Prime Minister demonstrated yesterday. Yesterday, Mr Morrison used the power of his office to instruct every coalition MP to vote against an inquiry into an anonymous million-dollar donation to Mr Christian Porter. It is extraordinary. You only need to outline the facts of yesterday to be struck by how extraordinary it is. And there's a higher point here that I think is worth making: what does the office of Prime Minister mean and what should it be used for?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often with Mr Morrison the power that is associated with the office of the Prime Minister is used to cover up, to protect people and to avoid transparency and accountability. We saw that yesterday when, for the first time in 120 years, in the House of Representatives the government voted against the Speaker on such an issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the modelling, we have had a long discussion in the media between the National Party and the Liberal Party about net zero emissions by 2050. We had extraordinary scenes here in this chamber, with a cabinet minister threatening the government with things getting ugly and a cabinet minister refusing to back the Prime Minister in. I have never seen a cabinet minister campaign against a Prime Minister in question time before, but that is what this week has been like. We have a member of the government, Senator Canavan, and a member of the crossbench, Senator Patrick, rightly calling for the economic modelling associated with the government climate policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the chamber and to all senators that the government are now saying that they have had a change of heart on climate. I don't believe them, and I think the Australian people don't believe them. We all remember what Mr Morrison was like, bringing in his lump of coal and saying that electric vehicles would end the weekend and that renewable storage was a big banana. We know all that. We know this is all fake. But what we do want to understand is the economic modelling that the government is predicating its policy on. If Mr Morrison is serious about net zero emissions by 2050, if he is serious about demonstrating that he actually wants to do something to get there, if he is serious about his belated assertions around jobs, he will get over his addiction to secrecy and he will disclose the modelling that he has been talking about.

It is predictable, indeed, that the Labor Party and the Greens will always seek any opportunity to play politics and do a bit of grandstanding and pursue different stunts. So of course we have a motion to suspend standing orders to bring on matters that weren't listed for debate today because they want to pursue another stunt to have a debate and do all of the different things that Labor will do just to make some sort of cheap political point along the way. It is predictable, and no doubt we will hear it in other contributions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, the Greens and others will always seek to talk down Australia's contributions, particularly when it comes to areas such as emissions reduction. They will overlook the fact that Australia has managed to meet and beat our emissions reduction commitments over the years, that we continue to be on track to do so and that the scale of emissions reduction in Australia exceeds that of so many other nations. They will overlook the fact that there is a good point to going through the processes of having clinical debate and teasing out issues, including difficult issues of dissent and dispute that may exist across communities in Australia and right across political debate, and to doing that in a way that enables people to put their perspective and have their views heard.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the Labor Party way. The Labor Party way is to try to make sure that everybody just toes the line. That's why when people dissent in their party they ultimately have to leave their party. Of course, in the Liberal and National parties, we enable people to have a freer perspective and to actually have views, to have dissent and to work through those different issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been reminded multiple times this week of former senator Doug Cameron. I remember Dougie Cameron—not always fondly—but I particularly remember a time when former Senator Cameron, speaking about life inside the Labor Party, said that it was 'a bit like having a political lobotomy'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You can't speak your mind. You can't think about some issues because they are all off the agenda.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how former Senator Cameron described life inside the Labor caucus, that it was a bit like having a lobotomy because you weren't allowed to speak your mind or to think about other issues. That's not the way our parties work. That's not how the Liberal and National parties work. We proudly enable our members to speak their mind, to bring different perspectives to the table and, in bringing those perspectives to the table, to be in the best possible position to address real issues. That's what we are seeking to do on the position that we will take to the Glasgow climate change conference. We will be addressing the real issues of emissions reduction and how we make sure we as a country track a pathway to build on the gains we've made in emissions reduction to date, to build on the gains we're continuing to make ahead of 2030 and to track the course towards net zero. But we will do it alongside clear plans around how we take communities with us, protect jobs and ensure that we achieve that in ways that give Australia the best possible potential for the future. We will release in relation to what we take to Glasgow those commitments, those plans, and we will do all of that when we've concluded government processes and before the Prime Minister provides those commitments in Glasgow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those opposite to be calling out and demanding that we do that ahead of finalising those processes is to ignore the proper processes that the government is rightly going through in addressing all of these issues. For them to be calling for us to release further modelling evidence or otherwise betrays the fact that they haven't released any such evidence. They've made commitments. They've said there will be a commitment to net zero by 2050, but I don't see any the plans, any of the modelling or anything else coming from the opposition as to how they are going to get there. As I said the other day, the opposition's policy is a bit like jumping out of a plane first and then checking to see whether your parachute has been packed. We in the government are making sure that we do all of the leg work necessary to protect regional communities, protect the jobs within them, ensure they can transition and support them. That's what we'll continue to do in the proper process, and we urge those in this chamber to oppose the opposition's attempt to disrupt business today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We will be supporting the motion. What we are seeing is the government yesterday agree to disclose some documents and then today fail to disclose them. This is not the first time this government has done this. We passed an order for the production of documents relating to the Beetaloo basin and the cosy meetings that members of this government have had with donor companies who were then worded up about the grant arrangements on a first-in, best-dressed basis. We passed that OPD, and then we waited a good eight weeks before this government complied with it. So this is their form. They'll say, 'Sure, fine,' and then just not comply with it. The reason they said, 'Sure, fine,' yesterday and let the OPD pass was that they didn't want Senator Canavan to cross the floor and further embarrass the government. This is a government that cannot disclose these sorts of documents because they are so compromised by what those documents would say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular transparency measure relates to the famed 2050 modelling that, naturally, the Prime Minister does not want to release because he is allergic to transparency and is obsessed with secrecy. The reason he doesn't want to release it is that the modelling is absolute crap. How on earth could any modelling say that you can somehow address the climate crisis that we're in by increasing coal and gas? The International Energy Agency has done this work. It looked at the countries that currently buy our fossil fuels and compared them with the 2030 targets those countries have made, and it found that fossil fuel usage will peak in 2025 and then fall. That's why we want to see this 2050 modelling, because it will be revealed as absolute rubbish. It's somewhat ironic that Senator Canavan with Senator Patrick's support want to see this modelling, because they too think it will be rubbish, although for completely different reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could solve this by simply releasing the modelling, but it won't do that, because it's utterly compromised and embarrassed on the climate. Glasgow is a week away, and this Prime Minister is still talking about a date that's 30 years in the future. For the rest of the world, the whole ticket to Glasgow, the whole point of Glasgow, is to talk about 2030, and this Prime Minister is having a phony war with his coalition junior partner—which suits the electoral outcomes of both of them, I might add—to distract from the fact that Australia is now the only comparable nation that is not addressing 2030 and has no science based targets for 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Targets Panel have advised us that, if we want to stay within 1½ degrees of warming, we need to triple our 2030 targets. The Prime Minister's pathetic 2030 targets—which are the targets established by Tony Abbott, that great climate saviour—are one-third of what we need to do our bit in the global effort to keep to 1½ degrees. If we don't keep to that, you can kiss the Great Barrier Reef goodbye. You can kiss our agricultural productivity goodbye. We already know that studies indicate that agricultural productivity in the Murray-Darling Basin will fall by more than 90 per cent if we don't seriously address the climate crisis and constrain that warming to 1½ degrees. These are the people that the Nationals still occasionally purport to represent, and this government is throwing them under the bus. It's not only throwing nature under the bus—we're used to it doing that—but throwing the productivity of our agricultural sector under the bus as well, and it is imperilling the future of our communities who have faced devastating natural disasters already.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the Prime Minister's planning on going to Hawaii again when he opens up the international borders. Maybe he won't be around for the next bushfire season. But Australians won't forget, and that's exactly why they deserve to see this climate modelling which this government is not disclosing. These folks just love running protection rackets. They did it yesterday in the House over former Minister Porter. They've done it today. They did it on the Beetaloo basin. They are obsessed with secrecy, and they are failing us on climate. Let's vote them out.</span>

We need to understand that this is about a transparency measure. We know the government, even if they did comply with the order, would have advanced a public interest immunity claim in relation to cabinet. I just want to remind the chamber that we saw the Doherty modelling going to the national cabinet, where a similar claim is made. We know it's a false claim; it's not in accordance with law. National cabinet doesn't attract cabinet protections. But, nonetheless, the Prime Minister, despite having claimed that, then released the modelling, because it was in the public interest and people are entitled to see modelling as it's presented to government. What we're asking for here now is some other modelling that relate to a very important topic that is being debated. There's lots of argument going on. It's great to put facts on the table such that the debate can be informed. The Prime Minister has the ability to simply authorise the release of this information, and that's what he should do. I ask that the question now be put.</span>

I support the substantive motion, although a little reluctantly. I think we have to be clear here that all this really does is provide 60 minutes of debate for this. It doesn't necessarily force the minister to do anything different. We've already had a minister explain the government's position here for five minutes. I doubt that will shift all that much over 60 minutes. But it is important to stand up for transparency, so I will support that approach.</span>

                    </a>  She probably would say no, Senator Watt, but we in the Nationals at least believe in chivalry! We believe that you should take her out for dinner or a drink or something before you sign the marriage contract. We in the National Party are definitely not ready to sign this contract at this stage. That is because, to some extent, the strategy from the government right now does ring a little bit like the old joke about economists: if you get an economist on a desert island with a can of tuna their solution will be to assume a can opener. That's the way economic models work. What we've got here is an assumed can opener plan for net zero emissions. We assume that this hydrogen will come like manna from heaven, from nowhere; it doesn't work right now, but we assume it works and everything will be alright. People in regional areas that rely on industries for their jobs deserve more than assumptions—because we all know that the assumptions are the mother of all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important too that we get modelling that seems to be inconsistent with modelling about net zero from other countries. Why is it inconsistent? Just yesterday the United Kingdom released modelling from the UK Treasury on their net zero plan. The UK Treasury's modelling shows that to reach net zero emissions by 2050, exactly the same target that we are proposing, the UK would need a carbon price of AU$295 a tonne—AU$295 a tonne! So we in this place can glibly say we're going to reach net zero by 2050, that it'll be easy—the Greens want to do it by 2030 or some ridiculous date—but over in the United Kingdom the hard, cold facts show that this will be a mammoth cost on every single Australian. Remember, when the carbon tax was $23 a tonne—we had it there for a short period but the Australian people rejected it in no uncertain terms—electricity prices went up by 10 per cent. By how much are they going to go up when we impose a carbon tax of 10 times that amount! All Australians will be hurt by that and many Australian jobs will be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a lot of questions here about how different and important industries have been treated in this modelling. My understanding from the limited questions and information I got the other day is that, in the case of the coal projections—coal production is expected to fall in Australia under net zero 2050 emissions—the modelling does not differentiate between different types of coal. In fact, it treats Australian coal the same as dirtier and lower quality coal from Indonesia and South Africa. Why would Australian modelling downplay the greatness of Australian coal? Australian coal is the best in the world, it's the cleanest in the world, and it's most likely to remain in very strong demand even if the world moves away from coal. Even if there are massive reductions in coal demand around the world, countries in our region are likely to continue to want the high-quality coal that comes out of the Hunter region to power their stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be backing and supporting Australian jobs. In supporting this motion, that is what I'm doing. I'm standing up for the men and women in this country who do the hard work that pays our wages, that pays our bills. We are only here in this great place in Canberra thanks to the men and women who work hard and pay their taxes on Monday and Tuesday every day of the week—for the rest of the week they get to earn a bit of money for themselves, but the first two days of their week is for us. We should pay them back by at least being up-front and open with all the figures we've got on the table so they can see whether they want to support this at an election.</span>

No, they're not interested in that. They just want to make sure that the political debates continue, that the cheap point scoring continues. In terms of the approach of the opposition, that's all that it's about. They're not interested in the fact that you need to confront the reality of differing opinions and differing perspectives, and work through those concerns. That's what we've sought to do. They've learnt nothing from the days when Dougie Cameron said that being part of the Labor caucus was a bit like having a political lobotomy: you can't speak your mind and you can't think about some issues, because they're all off the agenda. The government doesn't push issues off the agenda. We're willing to seriously confront those issues—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. Australia is a major regional economic player. In my own home state of Western Australia our iron ore provides the base material for steel mills in South-East and East Asia. Our food products are exported around the region and feed millions of people. Our education and training sector is world leading, and an Australian education is sought after right around the world. One in five workers, or more than two million working Australians, are employed in a trade related activity, working to create the exports that keep our nation strong. Indeed, many of those Australians are in Western Australia and an overwhelming value of exports comes from there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an open trading nation, Australia has been the beneficiary of the multilateral rules-based trade system that has operated for decades. But, as we know, the world is becoming an increasingly challenging place to do business in. The effectiveness of cornerstone institutions of global trade, like the World Trade Organization, are, concerningly, under threat. How we sell the things that we produce here into overseas markets is changing fast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a government that thinks deeply about Australia's place in the world and how we navigate the next decade of change in a way that delivers better standards and conditions for Australian workers. We can't go about this alone. We need to work with like-minded nations to reform and modernise our regional economy and make sure that Australian working people are always central to any of the plans that we make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement will be the world's second-most important trade agreement. I know people have expressed concerns about it, and the Labor Party have listened to those concerns. We take them very seriously and work through them. We simply can't be missing from the table in such an important trade agreement. The World Trade Organization will have greater scope and coverage over a larger chunk of the global economy than the current RCEP. The RCEP will create a dispute resolution and settlement process that will prevent economic or commercial disagreements from spiralling into conflict. If we look at the nature of the nation states that are part of this regional comprehensive partnership, having this infrastructure in place is particularly important. Therefore, it's particularly important that Australia is at the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want an agreement that strengthens the rules based environment so that Australia, as a trading nation, can flourish within it. The RCEP will tie our economy even closer to near neighbours like Indonesia, Malaysia and New Zealand. We can be seen to advance the opportunities for export growth through our major partners like China, Japan and South Korea. RCEP countries already include nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners. This accounts for some 58 per cent of Australia's two-way trade and 67 per cent of our nation's exports. But enacting the RCEP should not mean that we sit on our hands like the Morrison government has done, like the Morrison government has believed we should do as a nation. No single trade agreement, regardless of its scope, will shore up our economic future as a nation. The COVID pandemic has shown the critical role that regional supply chains have in ensuring products make the timely transition from raw material to consumers hands right around the region, consumer products that Australia needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must take advantage of the growth opportunities that the RCEP provides to diversify our trade both in markets and in products. Our small and medium enterprises are responsible for only 14 per cent of Australia's exports, and we can and should grow this as a nation. To put this in context, the G7 country average is 25 per cent and the European Union is 35 per cent of their exports coming from small to medium enterprises. So we must see this trade deal as an opportunity to boost the capability of Australia's SMEs and to grow Australia's manufacturing sector. It's interesting and important to see that the Australian Food and Grocery Council very strongly sees a future in growing exports to the region of their currently domestically focused household goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to continue doing this by harnessing the unique opportunities we enjoy to become also a green energy superpower. We have the skills and capacity to become a renewable energy powerhouse, and a strong Australian manufacturing sector can deliver world-class products. We want to incorporate and innovate cutting-edge technologies and provide good, secure jobs that Australian workers need. This is the future 'Made in Australia' that we deserve as a country. But it's not one that we're going to get under this failed Morrison government, as we've seen. This is a government that can't even come to a decision in its own ranks on the future of energy generation in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just reflect for a moment, we have a coalition government that is so divided, so riven with internal conflict, that they cannot even come to a decision on how they plan to keep working Australians' lights on into the future and the energy supply we need to manufacture our own goods for Australia and the region, let alone our households. This has massive implications for Australian businesses, workers and the future of Australian exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen, the Grattan Institute has told this chamber in submissions to the upcoming inquiry into the Australian manufacturing industry that the case for gas led manufacturing recovery isn't viable any longer. As we've seen, the source of low-cost gas in the eastern states is now very much depleted. The remaining gas is too high a cost to meet our manufacturing needs. So this gas led recovery can employ only a small number of people. If we're a nation that seeks to set ambitious climate and emissions reductions goals, then we need an energy future plan now—a plan to meet our targets and a plan to transform our economy. Making these plans now is much cheaper than waiting to the death knell of climate change in 2050, and we've wasted many, many years already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot continue to see the burning of gas and coal to generate the electricity Australian industry needs. Why? Because it's, frankly, more expensive than the other energy sources that we have at our disposal. We need a government that wants to use its spending power to invest in renewables technology designed and manufactured right here at home, to diversify and grow our export markets overseas through the rules based trading system that the RCEP maintains. This is not an opportunity we can let slip past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report jointly released in recent weeks by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Business Council, the WWF and the ACTU suggests that investment in clean exports could generate some $89 billion in new trade by 2040. That is more than we currently export in fossil fuels. We need a future made in Australia that we can export to the world, and so it's alarming when we see this trade deal that we're debating before the parliament. Yes, we can make a step forward here, and yet we are held back by the internal division of this government when it comes to our energy future. Those opposite are too busy having their ideological brawls in their party room to put a step forward to govern in the interest of Australian businesses and workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Bank says India needs to create 8.1 million jobs per year just to maintain its current employment rate. It is critical, therefore, to see Australia's energy supply is accessible to those nations. We know that renewables will be important to their energy future, and a lack of green energy supply, let alone coal, will constrain India's growth. We can become a world leader and a significant regional player in the export of materials and technologies needed to transition economies around the world to greener and more sustainable energy generation. This includes a decarbonising China and a quickly industrialising India.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trade deal before us strengthens this opportunity, but the Morrison government will leave us asleep at the wheel in terms of being able to make the most of these contributions. We've previously raised concerns over the Morrison government's refusal to release the final treaty text to allow it to be scrutinised before the agreement was signed. We have a government that is notorious for secrecy and notorious for a lack of transparency, and this is very damaging for how Australians view their leaders. Is it any wonder that we have parts of the Australian population captured by conspiracy theories when this government does nothing to promote transparency in government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it also means Australian industry cannot plan ahead. Greater transparency and the development of trade agreements is critical to building community support for fair and open trade. Labor have been in consultation with the union movement, civil society and economics groups throughout the negotiation and eventual signing of this agreement. And we do this because we believe in allowing people to plan ahead. A future Albanese Labor government would use the opportunity the RCEP gives us to work in collaboration with Australian business and workers to grow the Australian manufacturing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time to invest in Australian manufacturing. We might not get a chance as good as this again. Enacting the RCEP should function as an opportunity to take action and diversify what we export. Let's not lose this opportunity that we have in this agreement because of a failed climate change agenda here within Australia. This failed government needs to stop sitting on its hands, quit fighting amongst itself and start getting on with growing Australian manufacturing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. I've been listening to the debate in the chamber and listening to the comments of the Greens, One Nation, Labor and of course the government. But interestingly, particularly on the Labor side—and I'll accuse One Nation of this as well—they are standing up and pointing out all of the things that they believe in, yet this particular agreement presents risks to all of those things. So they're hoping there's an upside in trade without really examining the risks to the very principles that the Labor Party purport to support and, indeed, One Nation purport to support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I always listen to Senator Roberts when he says we have to base our considerations on data and facts. I agree with that principle. But this is a situation where there is no evidence of an economic benefit that flows from entering into this agreement. There is no independent economic assessment of the cost and benefit of RCEP, and there is no additional market access for Australian exporters. Don't we have a responsibility to look at a piece of legislation and ask: what are the pros and what are the cons? Here we have no view as to the economic benefits. Part of the problem here is, as Senator Pratt mentioned, whenever these deals get negotiated it is done in secret. There is no opportunity to see the text of them such that people can then do a proper analysis and present the parliament with information such that it can make an informed decision. None of that is there. Time and time again, I see the Labor Party stand up and say, 'We want transparency.' But the government just keeps going off and doing what it does, which is to negotiate these things in secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back and look at the better advice bill, it was a bill that was recently in play where the government presented it to the parliament without any of the regulations attached to it. Do you know what? The Senate stood up. The Labor Party, the Greens and One Nation stood up and said: 'Do you know what? We're not going to let this bill pass until such time as we get to see all the data.' The government then pulled the bill. They saw the second reading debate. They worked out they did not have the numbers. They pulled the bill and had to go away and then table the amendments. That is what happens when the Senate stand up and says, 'We are not going to do things without proper analysis.' Yet that's exactly what we are doing here—there is no analysis that suggests that this gives us an economic benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, this bill involves China. China has, in recent times, been acting in a manner that is quite harmful to Australia. We can see the wine industry suffering. I hope Senator Farrell chips in and gives me a 'Hear, hear!' in relation to this! The wine industry is suffering as a result of changes that have occurred, with China acting outside of our trade agreement. The problem that arises here is that we are effectively entering into further agreements with a country we know doesn't comply. So what happens is they do not comply but we are the model party to these agreements. So, for the next two or three years, Australian agriculture will suffer because we'll have one party not playing the right way and then we'll have Australia being a model party in the way it conducts its international affairs. That's the danger we have in further signing up to an agreement that may well benefit a country that is acting in a manner that is harmful to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the issue of human rights. Some of the countries involved in this are in breach of human rights. The Labor Party stood up and affirmed its support for stopping slave labour, for stopping the import of goods that come from slave labour. The Senate passed a bill in support of that, despite the government's opposing it. Yet here we are entering into an arrangement with some of the countries engaging in slave labour, and it doesn't address that problem. It's money before human rights, it would appear, not that we even know that there's money involved in this for us. Typically, we've negotiated these sorts of agreements and we haven't done well. That's what typically happens. We're signing up to an agreement with Myanmar, which is currently governed by a military junta that took power in an illegal coup in February this year. Seriously? That's what we're doing. We're engaging in commerce and engaging in negotiations with an illegitimate junta. I don't understand some of these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement may well restrict local industry development by, basically, entrenching the rules that discourage government assistance to local industries. We already have a perverse situation—I see this on the other side of the chamber all the time—where those opposite talk about competitive advantage, which is an economic theory that says that if you can do it more cheaply somewhere else that's where you should do it. What happens is that the government says: 'You've got to have leave loading. You've got to have long-service leave. You've got to have minimum wages. You've got to have occupational health and safety. You've got to have environmental standards. You've got to build your product according to an Australian standard.' I don't object to any of those things, but we've got to recognise that they impose a cost on Australian businesses. We then look at the price of goods and say, 'Hang on, it's cheaper to buy that from Vietnam or Burma or somewhere', where they don't have any of those rules. I don't mind the theory of competitive advantage, provided that it is provided in a practical manner and not in a completely theoretical manner. This bill entrenches some of those principles. Every time I stand up and say I'd like to see the government supporting Australian industry by way of procurement, I get confronted with: 'I'm sorry, Senator, that's going to breach trade agreements.' Yet we sign up to these things. It doesn't make sense, particularly in circumstances where there is shown to be no economic benefit, just a downside risk. We shouldn't be doing that. The Labor Party say that they support manufacturing, but they're now going to help sign up to an agreement that fetters the ability of the government to assist in rebuilding the very lows of manufacturing that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have talked on many occasions in the chamber about the need for us to stop exporting our rock—stop exporting just iron ore, stop exporting just our lithium and instead build and export steel and build and export lithium-ion batteries. There is much greater value in that, and it generates intellectual property, generates jobs and generates value. Do that here. But every time we try and do that here we get confronted with competitive advantage. We say someone else can do it more cheaply. That's because we impose all of these costs upon Australian industry. This treaty would embed that even further. That's why, when it comes down to it, I can't support this. I'm all for fair trade, but it has to be fair, and it has proven not to be fair in many, many circumstances. It risks increasing the number of temporary workers coming to Australia who might be exploited. I thought the Labor Party cared about workers being exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This can assist in that regard. It only takes the Labor Party to stand up once on a treaty and, suddenly, DFAT will have to change its conduct, just as Treasury had to change its conduct in terms of presenting bills to this chamber without the regulations attached. It just takes standing up once or twice and saying no. Then DFAT will have to go back and negotiate these treaties in a different way, knowing the views of this chamber—knowing the views of the representatives of the Australian public. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other concerns I have in relation to this. This does not invoke ISDS, but that will be reviewed in a couple of years time. For people who don't understand what ISDS is, it's a schema whereby if the Australian government changes regulations or does something in the public interest that harms an international investor here in Australia, they can seek compensation for that. We saw that attempted in the case of tobacco advertising. There was a health measure introduced to basically make sure we didn't make cigarette packets attractive. The cigarette manufacturer took us to the High Court, lost in the High Court and then sought to set up a company in Hong Kong to exploit the ability to then invoke ISDS—investor-state dispute settlement. In that particular instance, we were quite fortunate that the tribunal ruled that the company had been set up, essentially, for the purposes of engaging in an ISDS. So the tribunal did not agree with the company's claims. But we were up for, potentially, billions of dollars. This is a situation where the taxpayer underwrites the risk for public companies. So companies can come here, make an investment and make an assumption that there will be no changes in the law or in public policy, because if there are they will invoke ISDS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a risk that flows from this particular agreement because there is a proposal to review this again. Again, that is likely to be done in secret and just presented as a fait accompli in a couple of years time. It's part of the Labor Party's platform to not support ISDS, but on several occasions they have wandered in here and voted for trade agreements that actually invoke ISDS. It is a bit of hypocrisy that is harmful to Australians, because, again, it sees the public underwriting the risk of companies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by saying that I support international trade. I recognise its benefits. But when something is presented to this parliament that is, in effect, an agreement that does very little except expose us to risk, you have to stand back and say: that is not in Australia's best interests. And that is what I will be saying when the bells ring.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. There is no way that Australia should be signing this—absolutely no way. I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties when we had the hearings on this. It was pretty clear that signing RCEP basically achieves nothing for us in terms of trade. No.1, they won't actually release any independent modelling that shows the details. But, basically, on the evidence presented to us, there were no claims that it would see a massive improvement in our trade. There was no modelling presented to say, 'Yes, this is going to be really good for Australia.' Basically, in terms of our relationships and trade relationships with the countries that were part of RCEP, it was all going to stay much the same. So, No. 1, the benefits are basically zero. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you've got to look at the costs, and the costs of signing RCEP are immense, because basically it means that Australia is signing up to trade arrangements that are unfair, that are environmentally really damaging and that have no labour rights provisions or human rights provisions. It is basically an incredibly old-fashioned last-century way of doing trade that does not even stand up for the standards in most trade agreements that are now being negotiated around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about four things that are fundamental problems with RCEP and reasons why Australia should be saying: 'No. Come on. Yes, fair trade's good, and we're happy to enter into fair trade agreements, but RCEP is not that.' The first is the total lack of transparency in the negotiations and in the whole process, basically. The second is the lack of human rights standards. The third is the lack of labour rights standards. The fourth is particularly important this week, the last week that we are in this parliament before our Prime Minister goes off to Glasgow, before this immense time of the world coming together to tackle our climate crisis. Yet here we are, signing up to a trade agreement that has no environmental standards. It hasn't even got an environmental chapter. It basically says climate doesn't matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I will talk about the lack of transparency in the negotiations and in the whole process. I think the easiest way to summarise that is to read from the submission that AFTINET, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, made to the inquiry into RCEP. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current procedure for negotiating and ratifying trade agreements is highly secretive and is not compliant with the basic democratic principles that underpin our domestic policy-making processes. Trade negotiations are conducted in secret and neither the Parliament nor the wider public had input into, or oversight over, the development of Australia's negotiation mandates. This was the case with the RCEP negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Negotiation texts were secret throughout the negotiations and the final text of the agreements was not made public until after the government made the decision to sign the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That in itself is a reason why we should be saying no. We should be renegotiating our entire trade negotiation practices so they do not conflict with basic democratic engagement in these processes, and you can do it. Other countries in the world have processes that allow for much more input from civil society and from their parliaments before the agreements are signed. So it's not as if we would be out on our own in insisting that this be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area, as others have already noted in this debate—interestingly, although the Labor Party note this, it doesn't seem to influence how they vote—is the lack of labour rights standards. Again, they are not there. AFTINET say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… trade agreements should include commitments by governments not to reduce labour rights, and to implement internationally-agreed labour rights which are defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). These should be enforced by the state-to-state disputes process of the agreement. These rights intersect with UN human rights obligations and include freedom of association, rights to collective bargaining, health and safety in the workplace, no forced labour, no child labour and no discrimination in the workplace …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is what trade agreements should include. RCEP does not. Why should we sign an agreement that does not include standards that are recognised as what should be in trade agreements?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third area that I want to get to as the lack of human rights standards. I am absolutely stunned that we are signing a trade agreement with countries including Myanmar, China and the Philippines. And why? It achieves no increase in our trade. We are signing a trade agreement with Myanmar, at the same time as countries around the world are trying to work out what is the most pressure that they can put on the junta that took over Myanmar, in a brutal attack on people, democracy and human rights that has killed over a thousand people. There are people who are fleeing the Myanmar military forces. We know that the pressure is on—not that Australia has done anything about it—to apply sanctions. The EU, Canada, the US and the UK have all applied sanctions. We at least have said that we're not going to continue any military cooperation. We need to be having economic sanctions. All of this is necessary to try and do something about this brutal attack on democracy in Myanmar. That's what Australia should be doing in relation to Myanmar. But, no, we are signing a trade agreement with them. Why on earth would we sign a trade agreement with them? It can only be taken as us being complicit, as us giving tacit support to the Myanmar military's takeover and the junta in Myanmar. That in itself should be reason enough to say we're going to put this on hold, we're not signing a trade agreement with Myanmar as part of it. It is just something that is unacceptable for Australia to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a free-trade agreement with China that they are blatantly breaching. There are bans on our goods going into China because they are unhappy with us because we are speaking out about some of their human rights abuses and their expansionism. So they've decided to block our exports into China. Given that behaviour by China at the moment, given that is so live, given that the Australia-China relationship is at such a low ebb at the moment, there are many other things that we should be doing with China to work out how we improve that relationship. But blatantly signing a trade agreement that doesn't require any of that negotiation is just ridiculous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there are other countries—and I've been hearing speeches about this today: essentially, we're signing this trade agreement because ASEAN nations are the main nations that are involved; we want to keep sweet with ASEAN and it would be a snub to them if we didn't. We need to work out how to work with ASEAN without supporting brutal military totalitarian governments. Frankly, we are maintaining nice polite relationships with brutal totalitarian governments that are destroying the life of their citizens. We have heard so much on this in the parliament over the years—me in particular in my role as foreign affairs spokesperson over the last year. Frankly, we should not be kowtowing to them and basically saying, 'Okay, we'll sign trade agreements.' Yes, we need to work out how to work multilaterally, how we can work together where we have common interests; but signing free-trade agreements that do not require anything from them in terms of human right in particular, as well as labour rights and environmental rights, is not the way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, there is the lack of environmental rights standards. The other three areas I've talked about are pretty amazing and astounding, but the lack of environmental rights standards in the RCEP trade negotiations are just gobsmacking. We are in a climate crisis. We are in a time in humanity—possibly this year and certainly this decade—in terms of the future of humanity on this planet, where the climate crisis is the No. 1 thing that we need to tackle. Yet we are signing a trade agreement that doesn't even have an environmental chapter in it. It doesn't have any constraints in it, any measures in it, to require governments to take climate seriously and for that to impact on our trade relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, other countries in the world are very much linking climate and trade. It's quite right that they should do that. It is not just for a moral reason that we should only be trading with countries that are tackling the climate crisis appropriately, given it is a shared issue for all of us; it is also an economic issue. That's what the European Union are realising: if they are taking action to slash their carbon pollution by more than 50 per cent by 2030, why should other countries freeload on that? There will be costs, over the coming years, in making those huge cuts in our carbon pollution. The benefits are, of course, immense—it means humanity will actually have a future—but there are costs. So why shouldn't the European Union, which is taking those actions, say to other countries, 'If you're not taking those costs into account, if you're just letting polluters pollute for free, we're going to put some tariffs on you to account for that'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had our trade minister, just yesterday, noting that Australia is likely to be liable for carbon tariffs for goods that we try to export into the EU. And it is very appropriate that we should be. What that means is that, instead of having a price on carbon here in Australia that we could be reaping the benefits of, with the revenue raised supporting the transition to a zero carbon economy here in Australia, supporting programs for jobs for workers who need to transition out of the mining of coal, gas and oil—instead of that revenue being able to be allocated to that, it's going to go off to the European Union so that they can use it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, these things are linked. We are in a climate crisis. There is action that needs to be taken. Multitudes of international mechanisms all around the world are being developed to work out how we can work together as a world to tackle climate. The COP26 conference in Glasgow that starts in 10 days time is obviously one of the prime mechanisms to get countries to up the level of their national contributions to slash our carbon pollution. Here we have a government that's doing nothing. It's going off to Glasgow with a completely empty basket. We're offering nothing in terms of increasing our ambition to tackle the climate crisis. At the same time, we are signing a trade agreement that says zero about carbon, zero about climate. It is just unthinkable. It shows that we have got it completely upside down when it comes to how we think about what it means to be a good global citizen, what it means to act in the global interest, what it means to act in our national interest. All of those three things are the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the front and centre of everything we are doing we need to put human rights, labour rights, the extinction crisis, the huge pressures that the world's environment and biodiversity are under and the huge pressures that the world is under because of climate, because they are existential crises that the world is facing. With every global mechanism that we are part of, we should be saying, 'Is this going to help or is this going to hinder action on tackling the climate crisis?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things we could be doing to help. We could be going to Glasgow and saying: 'Yes, Australia is going to play its part. We are going to slash our pollution, as the science says should happen—by 75 per cent by 2030 at least, and to zero carbon as quickly as possible thereafter.' We could be doing that. We could be signing up to the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which has got 41 countries who are committing to get out of coal by 2030. We could be signing up to the Global Methane Alliance. We could be taking any number of actions internationally. But, instead, what are we doing? We are signing a free trade agreement that basically is blind to all of these issues that the world is facing. The Australian Greens support fair trade. We support having good relationships with our neighbours. But we don't support the sorts of arrangements that are in the RCEP and absolutely should not be supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0N" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Labor will be supporting the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. The partnership, or RCEP, as it's known, was signed on 15 November 2020 by 15 countries. It's a partnership that includes the members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations—Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam—as well as five non-ASEAN nations: Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. These countries make up 29 per cent of the world's GDP and 30 per cent of the world's population. RCEP is, quite simply, the biggest trade agreement in history. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Negotiations for RCEP started in 2012 at the 21st ASEAN summit, in Cambodia. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and trade minister Craig Emerson commenced negotiations for RCEP on behalf of Australia. From the beginning, Labor has supported Australia being actively involved in the negotiations for this extraordinary example of regional trade infrastructure, which, very importantly, was led by the ASEAN nations. In a big deal for the world and a big deal for Australia, it includes nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners. It includes economies which account for a total of 58 per cent of Australia's total two-way trade and 67 per cent of our exports. Ratifying RCEP means Australia has a seat at the table in the biggest trade agreement in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, Australia will be able to influence the rules as the agreement continues to develop. As Dr Jeffrey Wilson of the Perth USAsia Centre has argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On arrival, RCEP will be the world's second most important trade agreement, behind only the World Trade Organization itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, RCEP strengthens the rules already developed through a number of Australia's existing free trade agreements and creates new regional architecture for economic activity, with the potential to act as a forum for ongoing dialogue and cooperation. Further, RCEP includes core investment protections, rules requiring payment of compensation where an investment is expropriated, minimum standards for treatment of investors under international law, and compensation for losses due to conflict and civil strife. The agreement provides avenues for tackling non-tariff barriers including in areas such as quarantine and technical standards, by promoting compliance with the WTO rules and further improving cooperation and transparency</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, RCEP supports economic capacity building and, in particular, provides a dedicated chapter addressing the capability of small and medium enterprises in the region to benefit from the agreement. These protections and transparency provisions will provide greater certainty and confidence for Australian businesses looking to invest in the region. The advantage of RCEP is that it provides a single set of rules for exporters to use rather than having to rely on the multiplicity of different rules and procedures under the existing FTAs. This cuts or simplifies a great deal of red tape for Australian SMEs and opens up opportunities for Australian exporters looking to utilise regional supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional supply or value chains are an essential component of the contemporary global economy; I know you know that, Madam Acting Deputy President Chandler. They are a cross-border industrial network for producing goods where countries specialise in different stages of reduction associated with a finished product. The Apple iPhone is a classic example of a product dependent on global value chains. The iPhone was designed in the United States, and iPhones are made from hundreds of individual components, all sourced from various specialised suppliers in 43 countries across six continents before final assembly in China for sale to world markets. RCEP as a trading bloc will render such value chains cheaper and easier to access for Australian companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While bilateral trade agreements are lucrative in terms of tariff reductions, they render value chains difficult due to the differences in rules, standards and procedures from country to country. As a multilateral trade agreement, RCEP is designed to streamline these rules, encouraging the development of deeper value chains. For example, businesses will be able to use a 'made in RCEP' origin certificate with standardised rules for how much local content is needed to qualify. In this context, RCEP will make the Indo-Pacific the most attractive location to build value chains in the global economy, and a strong, vibrant and prosperous Indo-Pacific is good for Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an open-trading nation, Australia has been a beneficiary of the multilateral rules based trading system that has operated for decades. Labor recognises that Australia's security and prosperity relies on our continued economic engagement in the world and integration with our region, including through trade and investment. One in five Australian workers is employed in a trade related activity—more than two million Australians. Labor knows that open trade will be the integral component of Australia's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Labor acknowledges that open-trade agreements and comprehensive economic partnerships have become matters of strategic and geopolitical significance. Labor will at all times act in the national interest and in accordance with Australia's international obligations in dealing with open-trade agreements and comprehensive economic partnerships. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the WTO appellate body stagnates and reform is stalled, regional agreements such as RCEP are integral to creating an even playing field between Australia and its trading partners around the world, but particularly in our vibrant region, from which future prosperity will be earned. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor knows that the community is rightly sceptical about the Morrison-Joyce government's approach to economic change and trade agreements. We all know that the Liberals and the Nationals treat trade agreements like trophies to put on a shelf—ink the deal, get dressed up for the photo op but then no follow-up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's approach to international trade and trade agreements will be very different. To talk about the ALP platform, an Albanese Labor government will promote Australia's international competitiveness, maintain a commitment to an open economy and work to increase the volume of Australia's trade with other nations. Labor has a long record as an advocate of an open global trading system. Reducing barriers to trade creates more competitive industries and benefits consumers through lower prices and greater choice. Trade is a pathway to a high-skill, high-wage future for working Australians. Labor in government will set out an ambitious open-trade agenda aimed squarely at increasing the complexity of our exports in order to create more well-paid, secure jobs, strengthen economic resilience and ensure that every trade deal we sign will increase the living standards of the Australian people. Labor will promote services sector innovation and identify the capabilities needed to establish Australia as a leading global trade-in-services economy. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefit of trade can and must be fairly shared both at home and abroad. Labor will invest in education, training, skills and innovation, building Australia's national infrastructure and promoting the health and welfare of the community so Australians benefit from the opportunities created by trade. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from our own history that, while the benefits of trade liberalisation are significant, they can come at a cost to sectors, workers and regions that are disadvantaged by structural change in our economy. In the short term in particular, adjustment support is needed for some sectors, workers and regional communities to ensure that they are lifted up and not left behind by economic change. An Albanese Labor government will not leave those workers and those communities behind. Our industry policy will include structural assistance to sectors of the economy, workers and regions which are impacted by any economic change. When multilateral trade negotiations such as the WTO are not making satisfactory progress, Labor will consider high-quality regional or bilateral trade agreements that are in Australia's national interest and that support the multilateral trading system. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to trade policies consistent with Australian values of justice and equality, community views, workers rights and the interests of developing countries. Trade agreements must be consistent with Australia's social and economic values, be based on widespread consultation, provide for appropriate minimum and enforceable labour and environmental standards, taking account of social and economic impact, and allow sovereign governments to make decisions and implement policies in the interests of their citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic growth has been good for developing countries, but in many economies these benefits have not been fairly shared. More equal economic growth will create decent jobs, lifting people out of poverty, giving them economic independence and supporting human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RCEP, as it stands, does not have an environmental chapter or a labour chapter. When Labor was in government, trade minister Craig Emerson sought to include these provisions. However, other RCEP members were not amendable to this. Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Minister Emerson and the Labor government at the time rightly decided to proceed with negotiations despite this setback to ensure Australia continued to be involved in the creation of regional trade architecture. Opting out and retreating to the sidelines is absolutely not an option and to do so would have set back Australia's relationship with ASEAN significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of RCEP is capacity building, bringing emerging economies in line with established economies like ours. This stands in contrast to other more ambitious agreements with developed economies which include labour chapters with enforceable international labour standards. However, RCEP includes measures with the ability to continue to develop provisions in these areas through successive reviews over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor in government will not enter into trade agreements that undermine the Australian government's capacity to govern in the interests of all Australians, including any provisions that: remove Australia's protection of local jobs through the regulation of temporary work; waive labour market testing; further limit the capacity of governments to procure goods and services only; require the privatisation or contestability of public services; undermine Medicare, the public health system or the pharmaceutical benefits system; undermine state or Commonwealth workplace laws or occupational licensing arrangements; or undermine laws that relate to antidumping. Labor's shadow minister for trade, the very professional Madeleine King, has sought clear advice from the minister for trade and investment, Mr Tehan, that RCEP broadly complies with these terms and that ratifying the agreement will not undermine the Australian government's capacity to govern in the interests of all Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President Chandler; I appreciate you providing me with that opportunity. I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2021. I might elaborate a little further on some of the points that my colleague Senator Farrell was just beginning to make, particularly in relation to matters of labour market testing. Labour market testing is always a contentious issue when it comes to free trade agreements. It's something that the Labor Party, the labour movement and I think the community, more broadly, do have serious concerns about whenever free trade agreements are being considered. Obviously, the Labor Party's position is to strongly support the ability of local workers to obtain employment. We've got a very strong tradition of supporting that, and we do need to make sure that whatever free trade agreements are entered into by our country do respect the rights of local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Farrell had just begun to make the point that my colleague and friend the shadow minister for trade, Ms King, has sought advice on this point from the minister for trade and investment, Mr Tehan. The advice that she was seeking was as to whether RCEP broadly complies with a range of considerations that Labor thought were important. Ms King also sought advice that ratifying this agreement would not undermine the Australian government's capacity to govern in the interests of all Australians. I'm pleased to confirm that, based on that advice that we've received, RCEP does not expand waivers of labour market testing for foreign workers. There are a range of stakeholders who have rightly queried the inclusion of an instrument in the Migration Act which mentions a change to our domestic labour market testing regime. We have clarified with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that this is merely a technical measure and there are no changes to labour market testing in this country as a result of participating in this Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Indeed, the instrument under the Migration Act that was foreshadowed in the national interest assessment establishes that the obligations set out in RCEP form part of Australia's legal obligations. Such instruments are made under the Migration Act for every international trade agreement that Australia enters into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, RCEP does not restrict Australia's domestic procurement arrangements at any level of government, it does not require the privatisation of any Australian public services, it does not undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it does not undermine state or Commonwealth workplace laws or occupational licensing arrangements, it does not undermine Australia's anti-dumping regime, it does not include provisions that limit the right of the Commonwealth to regulate in the interests of public welfare or in relation to safe products, and it does not include investor state dispute settlement provisions, better known as ISDS provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to join with my Labor colleagues in commending the work of civil society and the trade union movement in their ongoing campaign, which has led to this government moving away from implementing ISDS provisions as a base for dispute settlement in all trade negotiations. That is something that has been an issue of serious contention within the community—the potential for these clauses to limit the application of Australian laws to overseas companies as a result of entering free trade agreements. The fact that we are seeing such ISDS provisions less and less in our international treaties is a testament to the tireless campaigning of the ACTU, the broader labour movement, AFTINET and others. Recent media reports that Clive Palmer is exploring the use of ISDS mechanisms to sue the Australian government reaffirm our opposition to them as a general provision of international trade deals. Having already forked out $1 million in legal fees because the Prime Minister supported Mr Palmer's attempt to sue Western Australia, Australian taxpayers don't want to be stung again by another vexatious suit from Mr Palmer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Albanese Labor government will ensure that trade agreements signed by the Commonwealth require skills assessments, including practical and theoretical testing, to be undertaken in Australia and not restrict such skills assessments for temporary visa holders. We will include in any future bilateral, regional or multilateral trade agreements a labour chapter with enforceable, internationally recognised labour standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party supports rigorous, independent economic analysis of trade agreements and, in government, will ensure that such analysis is conducted. Labor will also require that an independent economic assessment of the impact of each agreement be included in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to the parliament. I want to put on record my appreciation to the members of JSCOT—including my good mate Senator Ayres; Mr Khalil, the member for Wills; and many others—for the good work that they've done on this trade agreement and many others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The JSCOT report into treaty-making, report No. 193, which was tabled in August of this year, recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government consider implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of a trade agreement, at both the macro and sectoral levels, is undertaken in the future by the Productivity Commission, or similarly independent and expert body, and provided to the Committee alongside the National Interest Analysis to improve assessment of the agreement, increase public confidence in the benefits of trade agreements, and facilitate the longitudinal assessment of actual trade outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor calls on the government to implement this recommendation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This important review by JSCOT into treaty development would not have happened but for Labor. In discussions with the government in relation to the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the government, through the then trade minister, Senator Birmingham, agreed to Labor's request that JSCOT be asked to undertake such a review. We are glad that the government supported this and gave the parliament an important opportunity to examine the manner in which it addresses free trade treaties and agreements. This demonstrated the community desire for more openness and transparency from government in relation to free trade negotiations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor in government will ensure that Australians are informed about trade negotiations and will undertake full community consultation before entering new agreements. The provision of public updates will follow each round of negotiations. Where feasible, draft texts will also be released. Labor will legislate to ensure transparency in future trade agreements through the tabling of national interest assessments; consultation with industry, unions and community groups during negotiations; and the tabling of negotiation material in parliament where feasible—again, as recommended by JSCOT in its report into treaty-making. Labor will also commission an independent national interest assessment which includes a comprehensive social, economic and regional impact assessment of the negotiated treaty text, and we will mandate 10-year reviews of existing free trade agreements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very important principle to Labor that trade agreements not be used to undermine Australian working conditions and that foreign workers should be used only in situations where specific skill shortages are present and only for the period it takes to train and develop the capacity of an Australian to do the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that the underinvestment and the cuts made by this government to our training system—about $3 billion worth of cuts to TAFE alone—have at times caused skills shortages, which, of course, have been exacerbated recently by the closure of Australia's international borders. There are many employers who have been able to overcome the lack of skills in a particular area, whether that be a particular industry or a particular region, by bringing in foreign workers. Sometimes that has been to the detriment of Australia workers who haven't been able to obtain the training that is needed for such positions as a result of the cuts this government has made to skills and training. We're now paying the price. I know there are many businesses around my state of Queensland that are screaming for skilled workers at the moment, and that is a direct consequence of this government's to cuts to training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support the inclusion of provisions in trade agreements that confer on foreign businesses legal rights that are not available to domestic businesses, but while these are our principles, Labor is not yet in government and, as we know, international treaties are the remit of the executive arm of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth our thinking about the Liberals and Nationals' record on trade agreements in the time they've been in office. Labor called for the final treaty text of RCEP to be publicly released before the agreement was signed so as to allow it to be scrutinised by the public, but the Morrison government refused in another example of their aversion to transparency. Labor has previously raised concerns over the Morrison government's refusal to commission independent economic modelling for the RCEP. This is nothing new from this all talk, do nothing government. At a time when calm and skilful diplomacy is needed to resolve our trade tensions with China, the Morrison government has given the member for Dawson, George Christensen, and many others in its ranks free rein to spout inflammatory comments and spread misinformation about China. Under Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Australia is more dependent than ever on China for our exports and jobs. In fact, we depend on the Chinese market more than any other country in the world. That is a result of this government's policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When trade diversification is of highest priority for this nation Prime Minister Scott Morrison is putting at risk our trade agreement with the European Union due to his diplomatic ineptitude on the recent nuclear submarines decision. Labor knows that achieving genuine trade diversification will require a long-term, whole-of-government commitment and a plan. Every portfolio in government should be thinking about what it can do to contribute to a national effort to diversify what we export and where we export goods and services to. In health and finance, for example, Australia has remarkable capability that it has already exported, but more can be done. Australia has $1.3 trillion worth of funds under management through our superannuation system. We have developed an industry that is envied around the world, and economies like Japan are looking to Australia for funds management expertise. Similarly, in health, Australia is expert in providing health care into remote areas, which could be replicated in the complex and challenging geography of Indonesia and its many islands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is prepared to make that commitment and build that plan in conjunction with job-creating export industries. We would work with exporters to build relationships and secure the markets that Australian jobs depend on. Diversifying export markets is more than a photo op for a free trade agreement-signing ceremony. Labor knows that our relationships with our trading partners cannot be just set and forget, as they are under the Morrison-Joyce government. Signing a free trade agreement is not the end of the story. In 2019, the Morrison government committed to a range of measures to secure Labor's support for the Indonesian comprehensive economic partnership agreement—namely, compelling the JSCOT to review the way our country negotiates trade agreements. We are satisfied that the JSCOT treaty-making review has been completed and thank all members of the committee for their work in undertaking this process. We call on the government to implement as a matter of urgency the remainder of these commitments, in particular those related to worker exploitation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I rise today to bring the attention of the Senate to a significant anniversary in Australia's proud military history. The date of 19 November marks the 80th anniversary of the tragic sinking of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> off the Western Australian coast in 1941. It was the largest single loss of life ever experienced by the Royal Australian Navy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the late thirties and in the early stages of World War II, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> was primarily tasked with assisting the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean. In addition to protecting merchant vessels and delivering equipment and personnel, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> was also engaged in direct combat against Axis forces and collected a myriad of combat distinctions. Leaving the Med, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> returned home to Australia for a refit and to conduct operations in the Indo-Pacific region. On that fateful day in 1941, whilst on patrol just 200 kilometres to the west of Shark Bay, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> discovered and engaged the German auxiliary cruiser <span style="font-style:italic;">Kormoran</span>, disguised as the Dutch merchant vessel <span style="font-style:italic;">Str</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aat Malakka</span>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> took significant damage during the battle, and both vessels sank at some point during the night. Of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span>'s total complement of 645 Australians, not a single one survived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span>'s loss, conspiracy and debate have surrounded her fate, and it was only in 2008 that her wreckage was discovered, finally solving one of Australia's most enduring maritime mysteries. Today, the Dome Of Souls in Geraldton, featuring 645 individual seagulls over a lone bronze woman staring out to sea in vain hope of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span>'s return is all that reminds us of the brave men who served on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> and who paid the ultimate price by giving their lives in defence of this great nation. Lest we forget.</span>

The latest government figures from 8.30 am yesterday show that 13 detainees in the Park Hotel prison have tested positive for COVID. I understand that, as of this afternoon, there are actually 19 positive cases, including one in hospital and one who is so sick that an ambulance has been called. This is tragic, but it was eminently foreseeable and utterly predictable. The Greens and many other people warned at the start of the pandemic that this would happen unless all low-risk detainees were released from the alternative places of detention—the Park Hotel prison and other hotel prisons—into appropriate accommodation in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A vaccine program for detainees in immigration detention only began rolling out two months ago. In Papua New Guinea, where there are still over 100 people who were exiled there 8½ years ago, only two per cent of the country's population are fully vaccinated. Numerous people who Australia exiled there have contracted COVID. The country's health system is buckling under the strain, with Port Moresby's largest hospital saying it is teetering on the brink of collapse, with wards at capacity and its morgue filled with bodies stacked one on top of another. The government was warned about this and has once again abjectly failed these people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eight and a half years of ongoing indefinite detention is an utter disgrace and one of the darkest and most shameful chapters in our country's story. For goodness sake, haven't these people suffered enough?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to talk about emissions reduction in agriculture. We know that the Liberals have been playing politics with the planet and holding back on climate action for years, but this week has been a reminder that there's a group in this place who are even worse: the Nationals. The rest of the world is gunning for net zero, and these guys are playing around the edges, blaming the regions. The Morrison-Joyce government has once again left Australia lagging behind. The Nationals pretend that this is somehow a choice between saving the planet and protecting the livelihoods of Australians in rural and regional areas. That is a complete and utter fallacy. Action on climate change is good for jobs and it is good for our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The agriculture sector in rural and regional Australia is miles ahead of the Liberals and light years ahead of the Nationals. Industry groups have already pledged to meet the target. Meat &amp; Livestock Australia set an ambitious target for net zero emissions by 2030, and they did this in 2017. In 2020, the National Farmers Federation called for net zero by 2050, and that was well over a year ago, in August. In February 2021 GrainGrowers called for a 2050 deadline and a grain-specific emissions reduction target by 2030. Their position is clear:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The industry has and will continue to adapt practices, systems and businesses to futureproof the sector, enabling farmers to operate sustainably and prosper in a changing climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is totally at odds with what the Nationals have been telling us. They are saying that the regions are going to go to the dogs over any sort of climate action. This is rubbish. This is absolute fallacy. Some of the people who are working hardest on climate change are people in the regions.</span>

The facts are that COVID injections have harmed over 61,700 Australians, caused 141 cases of deadly blood clots and killed at least nine Australians, with another 556 deaths under review. That's five-five-six, and it's just those reported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the government has rushed to order $300 million worth of a yet-to-be-approved drug, molnupiravir, that research papers have shown can affect our DNA and our reproductive system and mutate the virus into yet another deadly strain. This drug is a wide-spectrum antiviral that inhibits viral replication by a mechanism known as lethal mutagenesis. Despite the government's massive purchase, the biochemical and structural basis of how this process works has remained largely unexplored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the US media, of the 775 patients in the study by Merck, the manufacturer, 7.3 per cent who were given molnupiravir either were hospitalised or died within nine days after treatment, compared to 14.1 per cent of placebo patients who developed COVID and exhibited severe or fatal complications. You heard that right: Merck trials appear to have allowed people to die to test their drug. Merck's research study was actually just a press release containing only an interim analysis of the data. A press release is enough to get this drug approved by our Therapeutic Goods Administration. The $300 million purchase of an experimental drug is ticked and flicked, yet the novel Australian developed vaccine for COVID, called Vaxxine, has been denied approval by the TGA, despite being approved overseas. The TGA is clearly favouring foreign pharmaceutical companies with dodgy products over an Australian company with a proven, safe conventional vaccine. Our communities, our nation, would like to know why. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  [by video link] In some states, this week is Gambling Harm Awareness Week. It is a week when people are encouraged to talk about the harms associated with gambling and the effects on communities, families, friends, workplaces and individuals. It should also be a week when we talk about the insidious link between political parties and the gambling industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent ABC News investigation which tracked gambling-related political statements dating back to 1998 showed that entities with a stake in gambling made at least $81.77 million in political donations over the 22 years. Nearly half of this went to the ALP. More than a quarter went to the coalition. But the response to these revelations has been met with complete silence from both Labor and the coalition. It's their dirty little secret, and neither will break ranks over it. The gambling industry is trying to buy influence and access to politicians, and over $80 million would buy a lot of influence in anybody's mind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo the calls by the Alliance for Gambling Reform that political parties must reject donations from the gambling industry. We must stop the flow of this dirty money to our political parties and to our candidates. It is money collected through the suffering and harm caused to so many Australians and their families. It is indefensible and it is unethical for candidates and political parties to continue to accept these donations when they come at such a high cost, measured in broken lives. Gambling Harm Awareness Week should end with both the Labor and Liberal parties ending their own addiction to gambling.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Yesterday was a fantastic day to be a regional Queenslander because yesterday we saw more investment in our manufacturing industry by the Palaszczuk government. Yesterday there was a $7 billion vote of confidence from the Queensland Labor government in our manufacturing sector, in the community of Maryborough. The Queensland government has announced plans to build 65 trains in Maryborough, and this means thousands of jobs—like welders, boilermakers, fitters and electricians—for Queenslanders, and it will supercharge our manufacturing industry. What a difference! What a difference this is to those sitting opposite—those in the Liberal and National parties in Queensland. When they were in government, they had trains built overseas. They turned their back on local manufacturers, on local tradies and on local businesses and made a mess of the state's train fleet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This fantastic announcement by the Queensland government just so happened to fall on the very day that, four years ago, Australia manufactured its last car. That was when the last Holden rolled off the production line in Adelaide, because the Liberal-National government and the Treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, dared Holden to leave. This serves as a reminder of what we've lost under the Liberal-National government when it comes to manufacturing. They don't value the industry and they don't value the workers in it. They certainly don't value the skills required in the industry. You only have to look at the government's own data to see their appalling record on skills. Across Queensland, we've lost thousands of apprentices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will rebuild manufacturing in Queensland. Under an Anthony Albanese government, we will rebuild skills and we will bring manufacturing back home to Queensland.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  [by video link] I rise today to speak about the dire state of COVID vaccinations in the Northern Territory, particularly in remote Indigenous communities. In one community alone, only nine per cent of people have received their first dose and just five per cent their second dose. There are numerous communities where the second dose is in single digits. Just last week, I spoke to an organisation that sent a medical team out to one of those remote communities. They took 400 doses, enough for every single person in the community, and they managed to vaccinate just 14 people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of our general population statistics are the worst in the nation. For those aged 16 and over, we have just 71.68 per cent of people having had their first vaccination. For those 70 and over, first dose is sitting at 86.4 per cent and the second dose is at 70.9 per cent. This is the worst in the country by a long way. The Northern Territory government is not addressing this crisis in some of our most vulnerable people: Indigenous communities and the aged. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of addressing the problem, the Northern Territory government is mandating that nearly all workers be vaccinated or be fined $5,000 and lose their jobs. Have we really come to a society where, in order to have a job, put food on the table and put a roof over your family's head, you must undertake a medical procedure against your will? And this is doing nothing to address the real crisis out there in communities. Instead, it is driving workers who don't want to be vaccinated, for whatever reason—and I disagree with that—to the unemployment queue or out of the Northern Territory.</span>

If we want to decrease the risk of getting disease, we should start making environmental transports. If we make a change to the transport, we will be able to have a healthier earth. But if we don't make a change, our earth could get worse every month or even year. So wake up and make a change to use these transports.' </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I want to give Queenslanders an update on inland rail. There's been much talk by the government of late but, as is always case with this government, you really can't believe any of it. Minister Joyce has blustered into his new portfolio, and it's clear he made big promises to some of his colleagues to get the leadership back, but, as usual with Mr Joyce, he talks big but the delivery is always lacking. That is always the case with this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first group to be let down by Mr Joyce are those farmers and communities impacted by Inland Rail in the route from the border to Gowrie. There have been multiple media reports indicating that they were abandoned by Mr Joyce days after he took back the leadership. Now Mr Joyce is claiming to be a champion of the Inland Rail going to Gladstone, but it was just two months ago that the LNP government in this place opposed a recommendation from the Senate inquiry asking for the Gladstone option to be considered. In eight years in government, we have seen three previous National Party leaders, including the first incarnation of Mr Joyce, dismissing Gladstone. We have seen cost blowouts and mismanagement. We have seen them ignoring the concerns of local residents along the route. But now they are saying they propose a business case to assess Gladstone. You just can't believe the LNP when it comes to Inland Rail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has changed? There's been the great work of local mayors such as Matt Burnett in Gladstone and Nev Ferrier in Banana. There's been an advocacy group set up by Mr John Abbott and others in Gladstone to advocate for this to be the case. Then there's been the pressure from Labor, led by Senator Sterle as part of the committee, and some of the work that Labor senators have been doing in Queensland. The LNP record on Inland Rail is diabolical: eight years of cost blowouts, eight years of ignoring the community and eight years of failure. You just can't believe the LNP when it comes to inland rail.</span>

What do I want Australia to look like in 20 years? In 20 years, I want kids' faces to light up as they see dolls in ranges of skin colours and find one that looks exactly like them. In 20 years, I hope that kids can have bandaids that match their skin tone. In 20 years, I hope that racially diverse characters in TV shows, movies and media are shown in a better light and are shown often. In 20 years, I hope that job opportunities and pay are equal for everyone, no matter what skin colour, religious background or identification. In 20 years, I hope Australia is an equal place, starting with bandaids and dolls. Though it may seem little, this is important. Knowing what it means to be accepted means that children can recognise racial discrimination as they grow up. They will understand racism is not right, and they will learn to educate others standing up against it. This is the key to a kinder Australia. A kinder Australia is the start to a kinder world. My hope in 20 years is that the differences we have shouldn't be masked but celebrated.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Yehansa, for your vision for an antiracist world that is kinder to all of us. It is inspiring to see young people telling it like it is. You are demanding and taking action for a better world. I'm ready to support your revolution. It's the least that I can do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  If you asked most Western Australians what life is like in WA right now, most would say that they're living their best lives. There are no local restrictions, no venue limits, no regional travel limits and no masks required anywhere. The only thing you can't do is travel in and out of the state to New South Wales, Victoria or the ACT or overseas. Frankly based upon the recent reporting in the west's newspapers, the vast majority of people seem to have expressed that the closed borders have very little impact on them, and therefore the lure of holidays by way of an aeroplane to some distant location is not the overwhelming thing occupying the minds of most Western Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This being said, I draw Western Australians' attention to the fact that the Premier has not ruled out lockdowns occurring in WA if there is an outbreak after we reach the 80 per cent fully dosed vaccination level. The implication of this is that should we get an outbreak of COVID, which is entirely possible before Christmas, your Christmas lunch or your hard-earned Busselton, Albany, Jurien Bay or Esperance holiday plans could be cancelled. Instead of motivating Western Australians to go and get vaccinated by way of an incentive, the WA Premier is resorting to fear and threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the Premier announced that 75 per cent of the workforce would face up to a $20,000 fine if they turn up to work without being vaccinated. This is outrageous and a massive admission of failure. Freedom, personal choice and privacy are big values. Why is it so easy for Labor to trample all over them? Stick to the plan, Premier. This all stick and no carrot approach is wrong. We know that we will reach 80 per cent by mid-December. Please, please commit to Western Australians that their Christmas plans will be secure if we get there. Stop the politics of fear and give us something to aim for. Set the date. I have faith in Western Australians, Premier. Why have you lost yours?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>): A Labor government is committed to properly funding working women's centres in every state and territory. These centres provide free, confidential assistance about workplace matters, free legal advice about sexual harassment, wage theft and discrimination, which are all problems for women in many workplaces. It's an essential advice service for all women in our community. But what has this government done to support working women's centres? They have almost entirely slashed their funding. This government has shown a complete disregard for these essential services that provide support and justice for working women. Each of the working women's centres in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland need a budget of some $700,000 a year to run. But in its recent budget, this government has set aside only $200,000. This leaves only South Australia as a service with secure funding. The Northern Territory is looking at closing, and Queensland is entirely reliant upon funding from the Palaszczuk Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government only cares about itself, not about working women. They gave a limp and inadequate response to Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins's <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. The Prime Minister has failed to listen to survivors of sexual harassment. He refused an independent inquiry into allegations around Minister Porter. He had to wait for his wife to urge him to take any action at all on the sexual harassment issue. Now this government is cutting funding to critical frontline services that ensure women are able to navigate the handling of sexual harassment at work. Only Labor will properly fund Australia's working women's centres and properly protect working women in our nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>): Like millions of Australians, I've been watching the Netflix series, <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid Game</span>. For those who aren't unfamiliar, it shows Korean workers compete in a series of lethal games for an opportunity to pay off their debts. It's a world where workers live and die under the boot of the rich and powerful. Watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Game</span>, I was reminded of Senator Stoker, who previously in this place accused 2,000 Qantas workers, whose jobs were illegally outsourced, of being inflexible and unreasonable. In Senator Stoker's <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid Game</span>, workers should be forced into any work arrangements or rates of pay regardless of how unfair, and, if they don't bow down and comply, they should be turfed out on to the street. I'm not sure if Senator Stoker has been watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid Game</span>, but it would appear that the makers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid Game</span> have been watching her attitude towards Australian workers very closely. I hope they've credited Senator Stoker as a source of inspiration in the production credits for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago, the Federal Court ruled that Qantas had broken the law when they outsourced those jobs. They haven't heard an apology from Senator Stoker. Now SafeWork are launching criminal proceedings against Qantas for standing down, Theo, a health and safety representative, for raising COVID-19 safety concerns. I'm sure Senator Stoker will be issuing another passionate defence of Alan Joyce very soon.</span>

This afternoon I'm asking Western Australians to go out and get vaccinated. It's disappointing that Western Australians have very low vaccination rates at the moment: just 74.3 per cent of people have had their first dose, and just 57 per cent of people have had their second dose. In the short time that's available to me, I'm encouraging Western Australians to get the jab.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech"> PRESIDENT</span> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  In starting question time, I want to address a matter that arose yesterday. I undertook to review the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in relation to a point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, and come back to the Senate. In looking at this matter, I have also taken the opportunity to review the rulings and commentary of my predecessor on glancing references and comments made by ministers to other parties and their policies. For instance, on 10 December 2020, President Ryan said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I have ruled previously that a glancing phrase in an answer is not going to make someone not directly relevant. An answer that consisted of attacking the opposition or outlining their policy would not be directly relevant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 4 February this year, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The question contained a number of loaded political phrases. The minister was, I would imagine, making a glancing observation and is entitled to some very wide latitude to address the terms, assertions and imputations in the question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, there is wider latitude for political responses to politically loaded questions. This is consistent with the ruling of earlier presidents. On this basis, I do not think it was unreasonable to allow the minister to begin her answer the way she did. However, having reviewed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, I allowed the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to bring the minister back to the question. That is something I should have done myself. We'll now go to questions. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:02</span>):  I thank Senator Wong for the question, albeit I don't accept the premise of all aspects of that question. Indeed, the government went to the last election, as we have to previous elections, with commitments to emissions reductions targets. We didn't have the same commitments as those opposite—that's true—just as we didn't have the same policies as those opposite, but we certainly went to the election with emissions reduction targets. Despite the fact that those opposite, and others, when we've outlined coalition policies to achieve those targets, have always said, 'It will fail; the targets won't be met; the government's public policy won't achieve it,' guess what has happened on every single occasion? Of course, we have actually exceeded the targets. The policies have worked. The policies have delivered the emissions reductions targets. And that is what we continue to do. It's what we continue to do in terms of delivering and achieving the 2030 emissions reductions targets which we took to the last election. Contrary to what Senator Wong said, the debate at the last election was about whether or not the Labor Party, with an increased target, had a plan, had a policy, had had it costed and had any idea of how they were going to achieve it. The coalition outlined how we were going to achieve our targets, and I'm very pleased to say we are on track to meet those targets. We are on track to exceed those targets. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so it helps to ensure that, on a per person basis, Australia's reduction of emissions is indeed amongst some of the biggest in the world. On a per person basis, we are achieving close to a 50 per cent reduction in emissions. Even on an absolute basis, in terms of the rate of emissions reductions, we are achieving faster rates of emissions reductions than Canada, Japan, New Zealand or the United States. I don't say that to criticise those nations; it's just a statement of what is occurring and a demonstration that, despite the fact that those opposite like to try to talk Australia down and like to try to be negative in some ways in relation to our achievements, our emissions are trending down, and we continue to deliver policies to achieve that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Wong wanting to go and ask questions that are about comments made by the Prime Minister in relation to Labor policies obviously opens up scrutiny of Labor policies. Labor policies taken to the last election were about trying to mandate outcomes and to mandate outcomes that would have different impacts. Of course technology moves on. Time moves on. And, as technology and time move on, we want to make sure that Australia is able to embrace the opportunities of the future, able to lead where we can in terms of the opportunities of the future. We're doing that through our investment in technology—not the types of taxes the Labor Party had proposed previously. Our investment is in making sure Australia can embrace the technologies that suit our nation, give our regions the advantages to secure jobs and opportunities in the future, while lowering emissions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's what we've done time and time again. When we said we would achieve Australia's emissions reduction targets and here were the policy profiles that would do so whilst abolishing Labor's carbon tax, we got on. We implemented those policies and we've achieved those targets, and we have exceeded those targets. And that's what we're going to continue to do. That's why Australians should have faith. They can look at our track record. In fact, they should have the faith that our side of politics will achieve that without the types of policies those opposite have been known to embrace that drive up costs of electricity, that drive up costs for Australian businesses, that hurt Australian families, that risk Australian jobs. That's what Australians should fear in terms of the policies of those opposite, because they've shown a track record with those sorts of policies. We've shown a track record of being able to lower emissions, lower power prices but increase the strength of the Australian economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yes, our home state certainly has something to celebrate by passing the first national plan milestone of 70 per cent double dose in the last day. It's an important milestone, and of course the nation has also passed 70 per cent of vaccination post-16.</span>

That's 70.8 per cent of those over 16, 81.6 per cent of those over 50 and 86.6 per cent of those over 70. We know that the people over 70 are the most vulnerable cohort when it comes to COVID-19, and we now have over 95 per cent of that population who've had at least one dose.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I congratulate and commend those who have been instrumental in us achieving those targets so far: our healthcare workers, our doctors, our pharmacists, our nurses, those in the state clinics who have all worked so hard in over 9,200 vaccine outlets around the country. Thank you for your work. We obviously need you to do more. Our national plan, agreed by national cabinet, is progressing just as we said it would, and yesterday we reached the commencement of phase B where we can start looking at lower restrictions and our country opening up once again.</span>

We've actually reached phase b of the rollout. We will start seeing the country opening up, as we are in New South Wales, Victoria and here in the ACT. As the Prime Minister said in an opinion piece that ran in Tasmania today, each and every vaccination brings us closer to bringing our country back together again. I join with Senator Smith in his urging of Western Australians to roll their sleeves up and get the vaccine so we can join Western Australians in having a free country. Families and friends can get together. Businesses can get going again. Importantly, our small businesses can get back to work, firing up jobs. There can be a safe easing of border restrictions as the vaccination rates continue to surge across Australia, and we can all start to take our lives back.</span>

Of course, that's 70 per cent of the Australian population. At the moment, the plan is being progressed through the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, and we expect advice will be provided to the health minister in the not-too-distant future. The government has been preparing for boosters and has secured 151 million doses for 2022 and 2023, to ensure all Australians can access a booster if it is recommended by the medical experts. Maintaining high levels of vaccination in our community will ensure we are protecting everyone, particularly those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, including our loved ones in aged care. We will be building on the strong foundation that we have already established through the vaccine rollout.</span>

As we've been very, very clear, as the second party of government we are taking our time to carefully consider the proposition put forward by the Prime Minister that Australia will be committing to net zero by 2050 in Glasgow. That is actually what rural and regional Australians sent us here to do, and we don't apologise for that. Doug Cameron—and I was privileged to serve with Doug Cameron in this chamber for many years—when he made note of how your party processes operate, said that you'd all had lobotomies and you basically just do what your leader says and you're a bunch of zombies, as I recall—direct quote, in rabbit ears.</span>

It is very, very sad to watch the party that used to stand up for the working class in this country fall over in the face of the threat of the Greens in their inner-city urban seats. Member after member, other than Senator Ciccone from Victoria, has been silent on water policy. You are silent on forestry and on standing up for forestry workers. You are silent on food processors and food manufacturing. What a joke you've become to the people that you actually represent.

This week is Anti-Poverty Week. Yesterday former New South Wales Liberal minister Pru Goward was condemned by anti-poverty organisations and advocates as being 'disturbing', 'abusive' and 'inaccurate' for saying out loud how Liberals like her view people trapped in poverty as huge cost centres, as an underclass of Australians who are neglectful parents and almost entirely lacking in discipline. Minister, as another Liberal minister, will you join me in condemning her appalling statement and abuse of some of the most vulnerable people in our community?</span>

In the absence of actually having seen the comments to which Senator Rice refers, I won't make any specific comment about them, but what I will say is that I take my responsibility as the Minister for Families and Social Services extremely seriously, and the absolute, total focus of the activities of my office and my department is in making sure that we support the most vulnerable people in Australia. Unquestionably, that is our single purpose and role. Whether that be through providing them with payments, whether that be supporting them with working-age payments or whether that be through some of our pension—</span>

I am not going to make a comment about something that you're saying, but I will absolutely guarantee to this chamber, unequivocally, that my absolute focus is making sure that the resources of my department and the resources that are provided by the taxpayers of Australia are there to support vulnerable Australians and to make sure that we support them when they find themselves in situations, whether it be when they are unemployed, whether it be when they're victims of domestic violence. Whether it be supporting the states and territories in their frontline service provision or in the case of child protection and the like, the absolute focus of my department is always to support the most vulnerable people in our community. That is why we have always been so tremendously focused on not only creating jobs but actually working with Australians to get them out of unemployment.</span>

Where people have received something they are not entitled to, it is our obligation, as the custodians of taxpayers' funds, to pursue that. When we put these things in place we were very clear to make sure people understood that, if they were receiving JobKeeper, they were required to declare it as income. If you go onto our website it is very clear that that is earnings and you have to declare those earnings. We will pursue anybody who has received taxpayer funding when they have not been entitled to it.</span>

The <span style="font-style:italic;">2009 Defence white paper </span>foreshadowed increased tension in the region, and announced the need to increase our submarine force from six submarines to 12. The RAN was supposed to have 12 new submarines by 2039. Now that the smoke has dissipated, now that the mirrors have been removed, it is clear that, under the new plan, in 2039 we will instead have only five ageing Collins class submarines. In October last year, the then DFAT secretary, Her Excellency Frances Adamson, advised that the China-Taiwan situation concerned her more than at any time in the last 3½ decades of her career. Why has the government left us so vulnerable, with so few submarines, under these circumstances? </span>

In acknowledging the number of points that the senator made I would note, firstly, that the government has clearly stated that the fact is Australia's strategic environment has deteriorated in ways that weren't anticipated even five years ago. We know that the Indo-Pacific is now the global epicentre of strategic competition, and that is why the AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States is so important and so necessary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of capability itself, we as a government are delivering on our commitment to deliver to our service women and men the equipment they need to keep us safe. I can confirm in that context that defence spending under this government will rise above two per cent of GDP in the coming financial year. There are a number of additional capabilities in which we are investing, along with those already planned, that will address the potential security challenges in coming decades. We are extending the life of all six of our Collins class submarines. All six submarines will undergo life-of-type extension within the budget of $4.3 billion to $6.4 billion, extending the life of each submarine by 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing in advanced long-range strike capabilities including Tomahawk cruise missiles, long-range anti-ship missiles and joint air-to-surface standoff missiles. The Tomahawk cruise missiles that will be fielded on our Hobart class destroyers are going to enable our maritime assets to strike land targets at greater distance and with better precision. The long-range anti-ship missiles for our F/A-18 super hornets can strike land and maritime targets—the JASSMs for our F/A-18F super hornets and in our future F35s as well. We're enhancing our capabilities in offensive cyber, in hypersonic systems, in autonomous systems, in space capabilities. We are confident, as I said at the beginning of your question, that these will address the potential security challenges in the coming decades as we move to the new submarine acquisitions.</span>

As Australians would be aware, the threat environment constantly evolves. In fact, it may come as a surprise to most Australians to know that the levels of espionage and foreign interference are higher now than during the Cold War. We know that there are foreign agents working with intent to damage our society. They want to undermine our security, and they want to interfere with the work of government and, ultimately, with the work of our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In ASIO's recent annual report, Director-General Mike Burgess said that espionage could well rival terrorism as a threat to our interests and to our safety. Of course, as members of parliament it is incredibly important for us to remind ourselves that we can also be targets for foreign interference and espionage, especially those who aspire to be ministers in any government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Director-General Mike Burgess said, foreign spies are attempting to obtain classified information about Australia's trade relationships, and defence and intelligence capabilities. They are seeking to develop targeted relationships with current and former politicians, and current and former security clearance holders. We should always be careful of underplaying the danger of being cavalier about the intentions of these types of people, of these characters and actors, should our paths cross with them as we go about our duties. As members of parliament, we must always remain ever vigilant to the threats posed by espionage and foreign interference.</span>

We know, in particular, that some communities are targeted by foreign actors in an attempt to recruit, and even unknowingly push foreign nations' interests in and around Australia. That is why, as a government, we have strengthened Australia's capacity to defend against foreign interference with legislative tools. These key pieces of legislation are helping our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies continue to have the legislative framework and the tools that they need to appropriately deal with and disrupt these actors. We will continue to make any changes necessary to ensure that, as a nation, we can respond to changing threats from foreign actors and protect Australia's interests.</span>

In the 2021-22 budget, we allocated the largest long-term investment in ASIO to address the complex and dynamic national security environment with $1.3 billion over the next decade. We've also passed legislation that will ensure that the foreign minister, on the advice of our security agencies, can veto agreements with foreign countries struck by state and local governments, as well as universities. This legislation will ensure that any deal with a foreign country is in accordance with Australia's national interest. As I've said, we know that foreign actors are now using cybertactics to further interfere with Australia's interests, and that is why we have made a huge investment with the Australian Signals Directorate.</span>

Mr Morrison's original transition plan, which was based on an outbreak of only 30 cases, estimates that 12,000 people will end up in hospital, including more than 2,700 in ICU and with over 1,400 dying. We've since seen more than 1,000 cases a day across the country. How many hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths does the Morrison-Joyce government now expect as states begin to open up?</span>

The national plan is designed to provide protection and provide advice to governments—state, territory and Commonwealth—as to the parameters with which we can start to reopen the national economy. Once we've reached 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, which we have now, we can start to take some measures, and we've seen those things commencing in the states and territories.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole purpose of the national plan is to minimise the number of infections of the virus, and also, subsequent to that, hospitalisations and presentations at ICUs and, of course, to minimise the number of people who pass away. The whole objective is to minimise those numbers. That's the point of the plan, and that's why we continue to encourage Australians to access vaccines. We've reached 70 per cent of the population over 16 who are vaccinated. We encourage more Australians from every walk of life in every state and territory to go out and access the vaccine so that we can continue to do that, because the whole purpose of the exercise is to minimise the number of cases that we have in the community, and that, of course, minimises the number of Australians who may be hospitalised, who may be subjected to ICU or who, unfortunately, may pass away. We know that there will be COVID circulating in the community. The best way that Australians can protect themselves, their families and their communities is to get vaccinated. The more people who are vaccinated, the fewer the people who will be subjected to the virus, to hospitalisation and to ICU.</span>

One of the first things that we did to support the public health system was the private hospitals agreement, which allowed private hospitals to support the public health system in the case of a huge surge in numbers. Of course, as we vaccinate more Australians, as more Australians take up the opportunity to have a vaccination, we reduce the possibility of COVID transmitting through the community. It protects individuals from serious illness, hospitalisation and death. That's the point of the vaccination process. That is also factored into the Doherty modelling, which is dictating our opening up process. So all of this is carefully calculated and agreed with the states. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Critical minerals and rare-earth elements are a really exciting new chapter for our resources sector, and Australia is extraordinarily blessed. We have some of the largest deposits of rare minerals and critical minerals in the world. We have the second-largest reserves of lithium, the sixth-largest rare-earths reserve and substantial reserves of cobalt, magnesium, tungsten and zirconium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critical minerals have a broad range of applications, as we know, ranging from things as simple as batteries in mobile phones up to things like wind turbines and even fighter jets. The application is extraordinary. That's why, as a coalition government, we are backing this sector, because we understand that the opportunity for Australia is absolutely huge. We've put together a $2 billion loan facility, the Critical Minerals Facility, which will ensure that Australia remains at the absolute forefront of the emerging opportunities in the global resources sector. Our loan facility will help unearth critical minerals and get developments off the ground. In doing so, these projects will help secure vital supplies of resources needed to drive a technology-led energy recovery. These materials can be used in advanced technologies such as renewable energy, aerospace, defence, electric vehicles, communications, telecommunications and agritech, which I'm sure Senator Davey is particularly excited about. The lithium industry alone is forecast to be worth $400 billion globally by 2030.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to our Global Resources Strategy, we will also identify new markets for critical minerals and facilitate opportunities for expanding trade. We must ensure that Australia harnesses these new markets, in the interests of all Australians.</span>

Studies indicate that, as I said, global demand for critical minerals needed for clean technology applications is going to grow exponentially over the coming decades. Australia is well placed to become a really reliable supplier of these critical minerals. Who will benefit? It's very, very simple. Our investment will mean three key things: more jobs, more export options and a stronger economy for Australia—jobs for the next generation of engineers, tradies, apprentices who will build and operate these mines; jobs in construction and infrastructure development to help get the product to market; jobs in defence, aerospace, high-end manufacturing and other sectors that will use our critical minerals; jobs to support new and emerging technologies; and overall more support for our regional communities who supply these critical minerals to the rest of the world. In short, everyone in Australia will benefit.</span>

The New South Wales government estimates that, through continued investment in critical minerals, more than 2,300 construction and ongoing jobs could be created for central New South Wales. The nine most advanced critical minerals projects in Australia could support 7,000 jobs and will unlock nearly $8 billion in investment for regional and rural communities alone. Australia's current battery industry is estimated to already contributed $1.3 billion to our GDP and 6,000 jobs, mostly in regional Australia. The Future Batteries Industries CRC estimated diversified battery industries could add 34,700 new jobs in Australia and $7.4 billion to Australia's economy, much of which will be to the benefit of rural and regional Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm hoping you have met with AgForce, who is the Queensland representative on the NFF, because they actually have very strong views on this particular issue. They are very, very clear that, whilst obviously agriculture is making great inroads into lowering emissions and different production systems, whether it's the grains industry and carbon sequestration or whether it is the beef industry, committing to net zero by 2030 without a carbon tax, I might say, which your government—</span>

But I love the fact that Senator Watt thinks it's too cute by half, talking about fake and real farmers. I would put a hundred bucks on the President's table that you have never sat down with a real farmer in your life. I am going to ask Georgie Somerset, the president of AgForce, to come and pay you a little visit so she can talk you through what your outrageous state Labor government has done to Queensland farmers—and that we are meeting and beating our emissions targets as a result of their hard work. We will always stand up for farmers—</span>

                    </a>  Senator Patrick points out there are blind trusts. Perhaps, as we saw in the House yesterday, there is a new low standard. Well, here we go. We know that the Morrison-Joyce government members break the rules that they don't care about and they change the rules that they can change.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate ordered that the minister lay on the table emails, spreadsheets and maps related to the car park rorts scandal. We know from the ANAO that the projects under the car park rorts program were picked from a list titled 'The top 20 marginal electorates'. You can't get more blatant than that. We know that hundreds of millions of dollars was shovelled out the door on projects announced during the 2019 federal election campaign, and we know that 77 per cent of the car park sites ended up in coalition electorates and not in areas where they were most needed. The ANAO found out—surprise, surprise!—that none of the 47 project sites selected for funding commitments were proposed by the department of infrastructure—none of them. This is egregious. This is wholesale rorting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government that Mr Morrison leads is littered with examples of scandal, rorting and waste. I have lost track of the number of ministers who've been exposed for their misconduct and their dodgy dealings: Taylor, McKenzie, Colbeck, Cash, Ley, Dutton, Fletcher, Robert, Tudge, Hunt, Ruston, Reynolds and Porter. All of these ministers have been linked to one scandal or another. I wish car park rorts were an anomaly, but this is the new normal for the Morrison-Joyce government. They spend taxpayer money as if it is Liberal-National Party money. The sheer quantum of misconduct by those opposite is simply staggering. I don't think it's about to get any better, by the way. There's a federal election right around the corner, and this tired eight-year-old Liberal-National government doesn't have any other tricks up its sleeve. There's never been a better time, in fact, to be a colour coded spreadsheet than under Mr Morrison and his mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anne Webster, the member for Mallee, had an uncharacteristic moment of honesty from the Morrison-Joyce government, but she's new; she might grow out of that. Anyway, she had an uncharacteristic moment of honesty when she belled the cat on the Building Better Regions rorts. She revealed that coalition MPs can basically just ask for any money they want, regardless of the rules of the grant. Depending on the whims of the minister on any given day, they might just get that money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in politics long enough to know that there is a view out there in the community that grifting, graft and dodgy deals are just par for the course, the nature of the beast and the cost of doing business. I think the former Premier of New South Wales Gladys Berejiklian said: 'What's wrong with pork-barrelling? Everybody does it.' She might have a different view about that these days, by the way. This view is supposedly factored in by voters, because 'all political parties do it and all politicians are in it for themselves'. But what is clear from car park rorts, sports rorts, Building Better Regions rorts and all 22 of the slush funds in Mr Morrison's recent budget is that we are experiencing an all-time low for government accountability in this country. This is uniquely bad. We've had grants for rural and regional communities handed to projects that are literally next door to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We've had sports clubs in marginal seats given money for female change room facilities when they have no women's teams. We've had funding for community safety grants cut so the minister could spend cash in an election announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The behaviour of the Morrison-Joyce government is brazen. Mr Morrison appears to have a blatant disregard for the rules and institutions of our democracy. The Australian people have a right to know what their government gets up to. They have a right to know how their money is being spent. They have a right to expect a higher standard from their elected officials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Mr Morrison and his mates don't even try to hide it anymore. Asked about the car park rorts earlier this year, the Minister representing the Prime Minister in this place, Senator Birmingham, simply shrugged and said: 'The Australian people had their chance and they voted the government back in at the last election.' They're not even trying to hide this anymore. Why attempt, by the way, to defend the indefensible? You have to admire the hide of the whole thing. They're just hoping that no-one pays close enough attention to their bad behaviour. As long as they get re-elected, what do they care? It's a disgraceful attitude. It is beyond contempt, particularly when we see communities that need community safety funding not getting it, particularly when we see areas that are affected by congestion neglected for a car park because they just happen to be in a Labor-held seat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, though, people are catching on. Look at what we saw yesterday in the House of Representatives. For the first time since Federation, a government has voted against the Speaker. It voted against a motion that the Speaker had given precedence to—namely, that former minister Christian Porter should be investigated for his failure to declare a million-dollar blind trust. We're all public servants in this place. We all have to follow the rules. We all have to be accountable to our constituents and the broader public. Christian Porter's decision to accept this money without declaring it constitutes at least an investigation. It looks like an outrageous breach of office, and he should be investigated. That was the view of the Speaker, a Liberal Party colleague of Mr Porter, who ruled there was a prima facie case for referral, and Labor supported the referral. It was Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister, and Mr Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, and all of their mates in the government who didn't. They held their noses and they voted against the Speaker for the first time in nearly 120 years, in a blatant display of disregard for transparency and accountability. It's extraordinary. It is quite literally without precedent in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Pearce is being protected by the Prime Minister. That's the only explanation here. He's the only Western Australian this Prime Minister has ever stood up for, and that speaks volumes of this Prime Minister. The Morrison government will hound people to their death with robodebt, but they'll help a disgraced former minister cover up his million-dollar blind trust. No wonder they don't want to fund a federal ICAC! No wonder they don't even want to present the legislation for a national anticorruption commission! No wonder they don't want to answer questions on notice! No wonder they don't want to abide by orders of the Senate to produce documents! This Prime Minister doesn't like answering question, because he knows the Australian people won't like the answers. If the documents requested by the Senate today could make the government look good, then we'd have seen them by now. So what are they hiding?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When voter cynicism in government grows, politicians like Mr Morrison flourish. Blokes like Mr Morrison have made a career out of exceeding ever-shrinking expectations. The only way we can restore the Australian people's faith in our democracy is by showing this lot the door, because, unless we get a government that is serious about a national anticorruption commission, these types of rorting, scandals, blind trusts, disregard of the Speaker, not answering questions on notice and not producing documents are simply going to continue. After eight long years of this tired Liberal-National government, the Australian people deserve a government that is on their side. Let me be clear in this chamber and with the Australian people: an Albanese Labor government will deliver a national anticorruption commission—one with teeth, one that will bring the transparency and accountability so long lacking in this tired eight-year-old national Liberal government. We will bring that to the national level, because the Australian people deserve to know what's being done with their money. They deserve to have accountability and transparency in their government, and they deserve a government that is on their side.</span>

This government has got form. They have got so much form with hiding information—hiding the fact that they make decisions based on their political interests, what suits their interests. They make decisions based on the interests of themselves, their mates, big business. They make decisions based on what they think it's going to take to win them seats rather than what's in the interests of ordinary Australians. This is the second time the minister has failed to present the documents that were set out in this order. I was particularly disappointed that they didn't even attempt to give any extra reason as to why they shouldn't give these documents. Basically, they simply resent a letter stating that, in relation to some of the requests, neither Minister Fletcher, his office or the department have seen the documents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">May I remind people that this is despite the fact that these documents were referred to by the Australian National Audit Office at a hearing of the rural and regional transport committee. The ANAO aren't making it up. The ANAO are there as the Audit Office to inquire into actions and programs of departments. They don't make stuff up. The Auditor told us there was this document that referred to the top 20 marginal seats. Yet Minister Fletcher and Minister Hume are saying that no-one happens to have seen these documents. How closely have they looked? The letter says the documents 'aren't to hand'. How convenient! Maybe they just fell into a shredder or something!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, what makes this so upsetting is that this isn't the first time. This government has got form. Let's take us back to sports rorts. In January 2020, when the Prime Minister was asked about sports rorts at the Press Club, he said, 'All we did was provide information based on the representations made to us, as every Prime Minister has done.' And in March 2020 the Prime Minister said, 'We provided information based on the representations made to us, and that included information about other funding options or programs relevant to the project proposals.' It wasn't until two months later, in May 2020, after significant new information had come to light, that the Prime Minister admitted they'd been involved in providing approvals for those sports rorts programs. 'The only authority sought from the Prime Minister's office and from me was in relation to announcements,' they said, but what we subsequently learnt through the committee process was that Minister McKenzie's office had sent dozens of spreadsheets to the Prime Minister's office and had sought approvals for particular rounds of funding. And the sports rorts funding was expanded after a meeting between Minister McKenzie and the Prime Minister following spreadsheets being sent to the Prime Minister's office. So let's be very clear, when it comes to hiding information, being slippery with language and conveniently forgetting things until they're forced to acknowledge them, this government has got form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the information in these documents, this is not the end of the matter. There is a long way to go. We've got Senate estimates next week and we've got a committee into these car park rorts. I'm confident that more information is going to come to light. The refusal by this government to be transparent with the truth doesn't change our commitment to actually getting to the truth and holding this government accountable. We will use the Senate. We will use the information that we have got from the ANAO. The rorting of this grant scheme matters on multiple levels. As I've been saying, it's consistent with the government using government processes, using government funding and using grant processes to serve their own political interests rather than the interests of the community. But it also matters when it comes to just good governance and making good decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the transport policy, before going on in a bit more detail about the corruption. This whole grant fund was the Urban Congestion Fund. The whole point of this grant fund is supposedly to be busting congestion. Let me share one of the submissions we received in the car parks inquiry that we've just set up on this issue. It's from the University of Melbourne transport experts. They say that after years of research on how to solve urban congestion:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The overwhelming conclusion of these investigations is that congestion reduction has failed because of the bias to solutions based on expanding road capacity. Put simply, the experience all over the world since the 1970s confirms that additional capacity induces new demand. This ensures congestion returns to or exceeds initial levels very soon after additional capacity is added. In the case of bottlenecks (a specific focus of the UCF), when one bottleneck is removed the choke point simply moves to the next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is now widely accepted by transport planners that building additional road capacity is not a cost-effective means to reduce congestion. More success has been achieved through measures that address demand such as pricing reform and strategic land-use planning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we haven't seen that road pricing reform, despite years of waiting for it. The submission then goes to what is so tragically wrong with this rort: building new car parks, just like building new roads, will not solve congestion. When we asked in Senate estimates what the justification was for even spending money on car parks in order to solve congestion, the officials of course had no clear answer about how they identified these car park projects or how they linked into broader infrastructure planning, including the work done by Infrastructure Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know why that was—the officials had to try to pretend that there was some rhyme or reason or semblance of connection with transport policy behind them. But it was because the entire program is a rort. They didn't pick the car parks on any kind of sensible plan. Basically, they sent around yet another spreadsheet with a list of electorates each project was in. So it wasn't at all a surprise to learn that the same staffer who was involved in sports rorts was involved with the car park rorts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw government moving projects between programs—shifting them from the community support infrastructure fund to the Community Development Grants fund and the Urban Congestion Fund. It seems increasingly clear that this isn't a case of just a single rort multiplied multiple times: it is basically the Prime Minister's office serving as a coordination point between the Liberal Party election campaign and different programs that are being run across different portfolios. This is one mega rort being run out of the Prime Minister's office. That's why the wish lists that were used for sports rorts mattered. They weren't just wish lists for changing rooms; they were wish lists for election projects across multiple types of projects. As Michael West Media has noted, often these projects, particularly the car parks projects, follow a pattern. First, the MP organises a petition to harvest contact details. Then, hey presto, suddenly they've got a grant to announce right before the election. It's almost as if there was a systematic, coordinated process to use public announcements to bolster their election chances without doing the hard work of genuine consultation and policy development!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale of the Liberal Party's approach to these funds is so awful that there are layers of misspending. We saw that in New South Wales with the recent ICAC inquiry. One of Mike Baird's staff has questioned the advocacy by the then Treasurer of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, and questioned why they were spending money in a safe seat. Clearly they saw the value in spending public funding in marginal seats for their electoral benefit. On top of that layer of corruption, the former Treasurer wanted a pet project. Entirely coincidentally, it appears it was in the electorate of someone she was in a relationship with! The sad truth with this government is that it's genuinely hard to keep track of all the different programs they've tried to rort: sports rorts, car park rorts, the Community Development Grants fund—the list goes on. It's exactly why we need a federal ICAC with teeth. It's exactly why we need to have something that goes to the heart of the corruption in this government, highlighting the inaction of this government and their refusal to pass an ICAC, despite the fact that the Greens bill for a federal ICAC passed the Senate two years ago and is there on the books ready to be implemented, if we only had an honest rather than a corrupt government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We sought to deny leave earlier today in relation to this motion. I recognise the vote of the Senate at that time, which agreed to suspend standing orders at that stage. We won't prolong debate in the Senate. The government still believes that consideration of this is just a stunt by the opposition, is completely unnecessary on their behalf and, in doing so, is simply seeking to further politicise debates in relation to climate change in its introduction and is seeking to get ahead of matters that are rightly being considered by the government to take a fully informed position to the Glasgow climate change conference. However, recognising that the will of the Senate has already been expressed, we won't object by way of leave denial at this time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make a few points. One is just to be very clear that the government spent some time today filibustering and running procedural games to avoid having a vote on the motion that they've just now had to have a vote on, and the reason the government conceded that vote is that it knew that a number of its senators were, to their credit, prepared to cross the floor to support a motion requiring the minister to attend. Recall that the order for production of documents that is the subject of this motion that was not complied with by Minister Seselja, was not complied with by the government, was a motion in fact supported by Senator Matt Canavan, so a government senator moving a motion against his own government or requiring his own government to provide the economic modelling that they have been talking about. So all of the shenanigans today were to avoid a vote that the government has just conceded. Just to be very clear what has occurred: Senator Canavan made clear he was prepared to cross the floor, as, I have to say, was the private indication from a number of other Liberal senators. This is a government utterly divided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments. Senator McKenzie, how are you? I do want to make some brief comments, if I may, about the approach of the government to secrecy and the approach of the government to transparency and the approach of the government to accountability. The government want to keep this modelling secret, because they know that they have cost Australia billions of dollars by standing in the way of action on climate and renewables. And it's not the only secret, of course, that we know the Morrison-Joyce government is determined to keep from Australians. Recall that yesterday Mr Morrison got every one of his MPs to vote to protect Christian Porter and his secret donations, but he can't get his divided government to vote for net zero emissions by 2050. The fact is Mr Morrison never takes responsibility, he leaves it to others on vaccines, on hospitals, on quarantine, on bushfires, on climate and on renewables, and he's not even in the room when his government's policy on climate and renewables is being decided by Mr Joyce and the Nationals. But, when it comes to protecting Mr Porter, that's the job Mr Morrison puts his back into. If only Mr Morrison put the same effort into fighting for the Australian people as he puts into fighting for Mr Porter! If only he put as much effort into tackling climate change and ensuring we support renewables as he puts into protecting Mr Porter!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole reason for this government's existence over eight long years has been to stand in the way of action on climate and renewables. And, make no mistake about it, any deal that Mr Morrison comes up with now with Mr Joyce's support will be nothing but political spin to get Mr Morrison through Glasgow and to get him through the election. I say to the government: Australians are on to you. They've seen what Mr Morrison is like, and they know he isn't the real deal.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  It would be too easy just to be wearily resigned to the secrecy and the endless and naked politicking from this tired, clapped-out government, because we've had eight years of it. Years ago, the government tried hiding the modelling that related to its tax cuts, and it hasn't let up since. We've seen relentless rorting—car parks and sports rorts—all with accompanying colour coded spreadsheets, and, when the government are queried about it, we've seen a bullying and uncompromising assertion that this is fine—that this is what government looks like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in the other place, the government voted to protect Mr Porter from scrutiny, an unprecedented decision to shield a sitting government MP from the scrutiny of the Privileges Committee about unprecedented circumstances where that person sought to establish a legal mechanism to hide his financial interests—unbelievable. This morning here in this place, it's just more of the same. We spent hours on this this morning. Remember, we were all here in the chamber waiting while these people voted to scuttle an attempt by a member of their own coalition, Senator Canavan, to access important modelling about possible climate commitments and the economic consequences of those commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government says it's all about the economy. It says it's all about the economic interests of regional Australia. It says it's all about Australia's economic future. But it's not interested in a serious public debate about those questions. It's not interested in a serious debate about our future and, as demonstrated this morning, it will do anything possible to prevent such a debate taking place here in this chamber, the very place where such a debate ought to be happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It matters. This kind of secrecy is just wrong, and it's reflective of the culture of the government: a relentless, unending pursuit of political solutions and deal-making in response to genuine policy problems. It's all tied up together, because it's easier to do a deal in secret. It's much easier when there are just a handful of actors in the room—a nice little subcommittee of cabinet, with just a handful of people who can cut a deal to shunt money off in one direction in exchange for another kind of commitment that may or may not be in the national interest. When you have cut your deal, it's a lot easier to spin it when there are very few facts about the content of that agreement, about the content of the negotiation and about what has actually been agreed and the consequences for Australia and Australians. It is much easier to spin when there aren't facts out there to contradict your narrative, but it's not what the national interest requires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a big, serious and consequential challenge. It's one that our peers all around the globe are willing to take on. Around the globe, when we see serious climate action, it's not the product of secret meetings or some new augmented schedule to the coalition deal between the Liberals and the Nationals. Serious climate action is a consequence of bringing people along. Serious economic reform requires a conversation with the very communities whose lives will change—an honest and open conversation that reassures people that you have their interests at heart and are not just skating through to the next election in order to keep your job, your ministry, your cosy spot and your big car.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's needed is a serious public conversation to grapple with an existential challenge that every serious country in the world—all of our peers—is grappling with at this very moment. Mr Morrison is going to go to Glasgow, he says. He should go with a serious plan to take Australia into the future—one that has been the subject of public discussion. The pathetic, endless attempts to reduce this to a grubby deal do no-one any credit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A commitment has been made to providing a more detailed response to the Senate by Friday 29 October, consistent with standing order 166. Let me remind you that this OPD was received only yesterday. Deliberations are ongoing. You want us to pre-empt outcomes of deliberations by releasing modelling that underpins current discussions, negotiations and considerations—and this is coming from the Labor Party. Let's not forget that the Labor Party took to the last election a commitment for a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 without releasing any modelling, without releasing any costings and without any consideration of what impact that would have on jobs, including jobs in regional communities—farmers, miners, and the local bakers and newsagents who depend on those jobs for their businesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear Senator McAllister saying we're doing a deal in secret. Well, we are having very serious discussions because we have been talking to our constituents. We are taking back our constituents' considerations. We don't do deals like the Labor Party, in caucus, and then foist them upon the Australian public and expect them to fall in line behind us. And, unlike Senator Watt, we actually know who our constituents are. AgForce is a Queensland organisation that Senator Watt doesn't even realise is a member of the NFF. This is the AgForce that used to run a fantastic campaign: 'farmers—every family needs one'. AgForce are a wonderful organisation, and you should know who they are, Senator Watt. You should understand what they have asked for. </span>

                    </a>  I stand corrected. Thank you very much, Deputy President. I'll go back to the important issue at hand. Earlier on, Senator Wong said this government was full of inaction—inaction! You're talking about a government that has seen massive reductions in emissions since coming into this place and taking on government in 2013. We've done this through technology, not taxes, and through working in partnership with industry. Instead of hitting industry over the head with a big stick, like an ETS or a carbon tax, we've sat down with industry and said: 'How can we all work together? How can we lower emissions? How can we incentivise innovation?' We're partnering with the private sector to bring a portfolio of low-emissions technologies into parity with their current alternatives. We're working on what is available today, but also with an eye on the future, because, when we're talking about a 2050 target, that is 30 years away. Imagine if we'd sat down 30 years ago and said, 'This mobile phone that I have in my handbag today'—because it wouldn't have fit in my pocket—'is going to be the mobile phone we're using in 30 years time.' It is ridiculous to try and cement us into a position. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing is laying the foundations for a road map, but we're not doing it blindly and we're not doing it deafly, and that is why the Nationals are negotiating. That is why the Nationals are looking at protections to underpin the very jobs and industries that have kept our economy strong through COVID. If it weren't for our agricultural and mining sectors, if it weren't for our exports of iron ore, coal, beef, wheat and rice—in the last year, we've had a good rice harvest as well—we wouldn't have made it through COVID with the economic strength that we have. We wouldn't have been the first country to return to the same number of employed people as pre COVID. So the Nationals— <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I concede that, as Senator Davey has indicated, the letter that has come to the chamber gives some hope that there may be disclosure. I just want to remind the chamber that the position of the Senate has always been—and I've just had a quick look at <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span> to refresh myself—that it is the deliberations of the cabinet that are accepted as being the basis of a proper public interest immunity claim. That is, it is the conversations that take place, and the reason for that confidentiality is the collective responsibility. The ability for ministers to argue across the table and for that to be held secret is in some sense sacrosanct, and I accept that. It doesn't extend to cabinet documents. The Senate has never accepted that. All too often we see ministers sprinkling the cabinet secrecy dust over things that it shouldn't be sprinkled over. Perhaps with the finance minister's $40 billion discretionary fund they bought a whole bunch more secrecy dust because they had to extend it to national cabinet. Even though we know national cabinet is not a cabinet, they're still definitely sprinkling the cabinet secrecy dust over that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some hope in the letter that has been provided to the Senate. That's a good thing. I urge the Prime Minister to release this information and to do so as early as possible, because there is a debate that's taking place, and debates are always better if they're informed debates. Let's see the modelling. Let's see where everything lies rather than having everyone guess. The statements made by the Prime Minister have even caused Senator Canavan, a member of his own coalition team, doubts. I supported that. Hence we combined to move the motion in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just remind senators that, in New Zealand, cabinet secrecy doesn't exist. There's something like a 30-day time limit, and then everything is released. Unless it relates to national security, it's released—and their democracy hasn't fallen over. Maybe it's time that our parliament started to consider whether or not we want to move towards adoption of the New Zealand system. It's a responsible system of government and it seems to manage okay—in fact, I'd argue that in many cases it does a lot better—through the openness and transparency that its cabinet regime offers the New Zealand people. There is an example that we should adopt there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just point out what the hard reality is. Yes, cabinet deliberations have public interest immunity. Cabinet documents do not, but, in any circumstance, the Prime Minister is authorised to release cabinet documents. He did it for the Doherty modelling. He should also do it for the modelling that is the subject of this order.</span>

I also make note of Senator Patrick's comment then that debates are better if informed. That's where I want to go to. Senator Birmingham said earlier on today, 'The government is doing the legwork.' If that's the truth, why don't they show it? Why have we gone through this charade for the government to capitulate anyway? Then the government argued, through Senator Birmingham, that they won't do it because Labor won't do it. That's got nothing to do with the issue at all. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is about integrity, and it goes back at least 20 years. It goes back 25 years. The integrity is shot to bits. And that goes to a fundamental point about this parliament: there is a lack of accountability in this parliament. The way to change that is to change the parliament. Let me remind senators here of what Senator Ian Macdonald said back in 2016, on the last Monday before Christmas. He said he wanted to congratulate me because I had started the debate on climate science that had never been had in this parliament. The debate on climate science has never been had. Senator Patrick talks about an informed debate. How can we have an informed debate about the second issue, about cutting carbon dioxide, when we don't know whether we should cut it? That's fundamental.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr John Howard, the leader of the Liberal-National Howard-Anderson government from 1996 through to 2007, enacted the Renewable Energy Target, and last year expressed regret for doing so. And so he should, because it's crippling our industry. He was the first major party leader to have a policy in place for an emissions trading scheme, that Tony Abbott rightly called a carbon tax. The first leader of a major party in this country with an ETS—an emission trading scheme, a carbon tax—was John Howard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John Howard enacted all of these things and, along with his government, stole farmers property rights to comply with the Kyoto protocol. That is fact. His government did so by going around the Constitution to avoid section 51(xxxi) and paying 'just terms' compensation to farmers. He went through the state governments to do that. So the Howard-Anderson Liberal-National government went through the back door, deceitfully around the Constitution, to steal farmers property rights. This is about integrity. And then, to cap it off, in 2014 John Howard, speaking at a sceptics conference in London, said that in all of this climate science he is agnostic. He is agnostic. He put in all these policies, stole hundreds of billions of dollars worth of farmers property rights, yet didn't have the science.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shocked though everyone may be, I agree with Senator Waters today. She said that modelling is crap, and she is absolutely correct. She talked about kissing the Great Barrier Reef goodbye, agricultural productivity sliding, saying goodbye to the Murray Darling Basin. And yet, for 773 days, she has refused to provide empirical scientific evidence that we need to cut carbon dioxide. For 11 years she has failed to do that. I was a joint panellist with Senator Waters in October 2010, and I challenged her as a member of the panel, so I challenged a fellow panellist, to debate me on the science, to debate me on the corruption of science. She jumped to her feet and said, 'I will not debate you.' They have not got a position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear comments from the Greens about kissing the Great Barrier Reef goodbye. The core premise is that we need to cut carbon dioxide. We have not discussed that in this parliament, ever, and yet we're going to launch into a crusade for trillions of dollars destroying this country. Trillions of dollars worth of opportunity cost. We need to get back to the basics and have a debate about integrity and accountability. Let's have the data out, and let's start that debate.</span>

So I say to Senator Roberts, if we stand by, if we stand back and deny the reality of what is happening in our major trading partners, then a lot of those major trading partners that we had—Japan, Korea, Taiwan—that supported the development of our mining industries in Australia, will move towards a net zero emissions policy by 2050. They are moving. To some extent, what Australia does is irrelevant. The world is moving, and it would be wrong of us to deny that reality. </span>

We would be doing a great disservice to our country to deny the reality, and that is the reality. We have to look outwards—we're a trading nation; we have to look outwards—and see what is happening in the world. We have the responsibility to do that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember sitting on a Senate select committee with Senator Ayres, and the AMWU gave evidence which I found particularly compelling in relation to industries such as the car industry and other heavy manufacturing industries, and it was a repeated theme around the country—that, when those major industries shut down, the research suggests that a third of workers maybe find full-time work somewhere else; a third go into a repetitious cycle of casual work and part-time work, and they never get back into full-time work; and a third of workers never get employed again.

Those great nations are focused in terms of those new technologies. They're focused on them. We can't lose the opportunity to work with them. If we do, we will be letting down our communities. The government have been abundantly clear that it is a cornerstone of our policy that there will be no carbon tax. But what there will be is an embracing of new technologies, and, in particular, hydrogen. </span>

And, Senator Roberts, given your background in the coalmining industry, you know that they were one of our most successful trading partners in terms of coalmining. If you look at the material being put out by the Japanese ministry of economy, their focus is on building a hydrogen industry. We have to be part of that supply chain. And I say to those who doubt it: look at the track record of countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and how successful we have been working with them. But we have to work with them; we can't deny their reality, which is there for all to see. We can't deny that reality. </span>

The opportunity is there. We've got to embrace it and we've got to embrace it optimistically. The technology is being developed. We've got to look forward with optimism. There are opportunities there, but we have to have the courage to seize them and make the most of them. </span>

This is a government that protects jobs, keeps the lights on and keeps energy prices lower, quarter on quarter on quarter. Our approach that we outlined to the Australian people before the last election was emissions reduction through technology, not taxes; expanding consumer choices, not restricting them. We will achieve a net zero ambition for this country with incentives, not with penalties. We will partner with the private sector to bring a portfolio of low emission technologies to parity with their current alternatives or better, consolidating our advantage in affordable and reliable energy whilst being a credible, transparent government accountable to Australians for our progress.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKenzie, I highly recommend you stick around; I'll make it worth your while. The week is nearly over in Canberra. This is a week where we have seen the National Party, the once proud National Party of Black Jack McEwen—a party that once had some principles, some spine, some real leaders, which Senator McKenzie has actually written about—now represented in this parliament by a bunch of fakes. We've seen the National Party spending the entire week performing for the cameras, performing for the media, like a bunch of circus clowns, achieving absolutely nothing, again, for the people of regional Australia. Have there ever been a bigger bunch of fakes in this Australian parliament than the current National Party representatives that we see here? These people in the National Party are such fakes that they make Milli Vanilli look like the definition of authentic. They are so utterly fake—Senator Davey included—in their fight for regional Australia that we have seen play out over the course of this week. What is it all about? It's about a plan that the Prime Minister has already stitched up with Barnaby Joyce on behalf of the National Party to look like they are doing something about net zero emissions while actually doing absolutely nothing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before this week, what we will see from this government at some point over the next week, before the Prime Minister goes to Glasgow, is a fake plan from a fake Prime Minister backed in by fake farmers and fake miners. It is completely and utterly fake. It will be a plan that will not be legislated, because they can't even take it to the coalition party room. It will be signed up to by Barnaby Joyce, who has spent his entire political career opposing action on climate change. It will also be signed by a Prime Minister who has spent his career opposing climate change action. Yet we are to believe that, all of a sudden, this Prime Minister has had this road to Damascus conversion and is now a greenie. Please, spare me. It is utterly fake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have been able to put to the government in question time today is what real farmers and what real miners have to say about net zero emissions, because we've heard a lot from the fakes in the National Party about their concern about the impact of net zero emissions on farming communities and mining jobs. But what do real miners and real farmers have to say about net-zero emissions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the National Farmers Federation for some time now have been committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, because they say that is the best way for agricultural exporters to avoid the kind of tariffs that we are going to see from our trading partners and because they understand that farmers, probably more than anyone, need to adjust to a changing climate. We've seen the President of the NFF, Fiona Simson, say that if the government doesn't sign up to net-zero emissions by 2050 that will punish farmers. So that's what real farmers have to say about this. Meat &amp; Livestock Australia have actually gone further than the NFF by committing their industry, the meat and livestock industry, to being carbon neutral by 2030. So what real farmers have to say is that we need net-zero emissions by 2050, and it's the fake farmers in the National Party who keep saying no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly what do real miners have to say about net-zero emissions? We've seen the Minerals Council of Australia commit to net-zero emissions by 2050. We've seen BHP do it. We've seen Rio Tinto do it, and overnight Rio Tinto made an even more significant announcement about their commitment to reduce emissions. We've seen APPEA, on behalf of the oil and gas industry, commit to net-zero emissions, along with Santos, Origin and almost every other resources company in this country. And why? Because they want to make money. They're not greenies; they want to make money. They want to create more jobs, and they know that the way they're going to do it in the resources industry is by committing to net-zero emissions by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we see that the real farmers support net zero, while we have the fake farmers in the National Party continuing to oppose it. We see the real miners in this community supporting net-zero emissions, while the fake farmers in the National Party continue to oppose it. This is not the first time that we've seen the National Party faking it. They fake it till they make it every single day they come down here, because these are the people who claim that they care about regional jobs while doing nothing about labour hire and casualisation in mining communities, about regional grants going to the cities, about spending disaster management funding in regions and about health care in the regions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  It's a pleasure to make some comments about this answer, and I think that was a very amusing performance from Senator Watt. It would be good to know what his definition of a fake farmer is. I have to say I wasn't too sure. I've spent most of my life in regional Australia, so I'm very interested in it, and it's good to hear that the Labor Party is also interested in it, because there is no question that the changes that are going to occur in our economy over the next 20 to 30 years will have a disproportionate impact on people living in regional Australia. So I welcome the opportunity to make a few remarks about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The compelling point is that the wall of money has made up its mind. Global capital markets ultimately will not fund fossil fuel investments over the long run. The preferences of our customers in Asia will change, and that means that we must respond accordingly. The benefit that will come to regional Australia from the transition will be significant. It'll be significant in the mining sector. It'll be significant in the farming sector. I actually think that a disproportionate positive impact could accrue to regional Australia as a result of this transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about the debate that we have about jobs, which I think is an entirely legitimate one. There are heavy-industry jobs in the bush today, in coal and other sectors, and over the long run those will be replaced by other heavy-industry jobs. There will be offshore wind. There will be hydrogen. There will be hydroelectric. These are energy-generating assets and investments that will provide heavy-industry jobs in regional Australia. One of the first major offshore wind developments is off Gippsland in Victoria, and we're already seeing workers who were in the coal industry now working on that offshore wind project. Those are heavy-industry jobs. So that is an important factor here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy of our government will be to have a plan and a target to get to net zero by 2050. I think that's good. It's good to have a target. It's good that we can indicate to global capital markets where the country is heading. It's positive that there will be a detailed plan on how that will occur. I think that is a positive thing. I think you will see the heaviest amount of policy work that has been done on emissions reduction appear over the next few weeks in Australia, ahead of the Glasgow conference. The great beneficiaries of the bulk of the change over the long run could well be regional Australia. But we have to tell the truth. I don't think we should be telling lies to the Australian people about the prospects for different industries over the long run. It is a long transition over these next 25 to 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't surprise me that the Minerals Council and the Farmers Federation support net zero. It doesn't surprise me at all, because they see the opportunities. You will see lithium mining and copper mining, and you will see carbon abatement services provided by farmers in regional Australia, which could actually include us getting beyond net zero. I think Australia could become an exporter of carbon abatement services given our large land mass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leadership is about telling the truth and identifying pathways through difficult challenges. This has been an issue which has been caught in a culture war for too long. I've never understood why this issue was part of a culture war; I think it's weird. I'm very pleased that we're coming out of that. I think that's good for people who live in regional Australia, because, frankly, it'll be a very expensive transition, and the government is not going to be paying for the transition. A large part of the transition will be coming from the private economy, and most of it will be foreign capital that will be needed to fund these huge investments. The people that are building the offshore wind facility in Gippsland are not Australian investors; they're groups such as Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. Many of these developments across the country will be relying on foreign capital, and that's why it's important that we give clear external signals about our direction on this policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise to take note of the answer from the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. Today, we had Senator Bragg's very plain, disconnected-from-emotion contribution to the debate. But this is an issue that actually matters to people. It's intimately entwined with their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no clearer indication that the National Party stand for absolutely nothing, have no real connection to reality and are in terminal decline than the answers that we received from the minister today. The party, which began as one that was by regional Australia for regional Australia, has become something else entirely. Detached from the major rural industries, many members of the current National Party have become a party of right-wing grievance, fighting culture wars instead of standing up for rural and regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a performance for some of them. Senator Canavan, a former KPMG and Productivity Commission economist and political staffer, parades about in high-vis as if he's worked his whole life in a blue-collar industry. It's not the truth. We even see George Christensen, the departing member for Dawson, spending more of his time on culture war crusades, appearing on far-Right podcasts and next to neo-Nazis at rallies and doing his utmost to undermine Australia's vaccine drive. He does all of that rather than standing up and speaking up for rural and regional communities, who can't get in to see a GP, who haven't got adequate housing and who have been described in this chamber this week by the Nationals as the most marginalised and poverty-stricken communities in this country. That's what 75 years of the Nationals have delivered. They are absolutely failing at the moment. In the last three years, the National Party has had two members leave its party room to sit on the crossbench. One left over its coup culture, and the most recent was former minister Darren Chester, who slammed what he called an extreme-Right push in the party by certain members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a government that has a plan to address climate change. Instead of a plan, we have had eight years of backstabbing and political infighting driven by this hard-Right rump of the party room. The Liberal-National coalition is a party at war with itself, and that is on display for everyone to see this week. The Nationals have no vision. They are disconnected from the reality of the lives of the people they purport to represent. Their myopic vision for Australia is for us to be an international pariah and to miss the opportunity to capitalise on a chance to reinvigorate our heavy industry sector with cheap green energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do they continue in this vein? Who do the Nationals really stand for? They don't stand for miners, as much as they come in here and bleat and moan to us that they do. They are new friends to the miners. They did not stand with them, and they have overseen rampant casualisation and the increase of insecure work in mining across this country. They don't stand for farmers either. Farmers are at the forefront of the fight against climate change. They live it every day. It affects their bank balance. It affects their family. It affects their community. They know more than anyone else what violent increases in weather events have done. There are stories on the Darling of people trying to pump water back into the river, using that precious asset to try and stop some of the fish deaths that we have been seeing right across this country. They are taking money out of their pockets, literally, to put it into the environment to try and save some of the fish in the environment that they care for. That's who the real farmers of Australia are. They are intimately connected with the land that they work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we have in here the National Party being increasingly dictated to by the echo chamber of far Right media outlets, and we have the National Party telling their voters an easy lie rather than a hard truth, attempting to prop up their moribund political party by fighting a desperate rearguard action against Australia's efforts to fight climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party is out of step with the global community. They are out of step with their own supposed community in the regions of Australia. They are time limited. They simply cannot connect themselves to a future for this country and for the people they claim to represent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  We have come in here today for another sermon, another lecture from the Labor Party about real farmers and fake farmers, real miners and fake miners, notwithstanding that there is no such thing to the people of the Morrison government, which understands that Australian industry is imperative to the hundreds of thousands, indeed, the millions of Australians who depend on those industries for jobs. But we don't have the hide to say one thing before an election and then slap people with a big tax afterwards, and not just the carbon tax, which we discussed a little earlier today. The Labor Party was the party of the mining tax the last time they were in government. The Morrison government, and the senators on this side of the chamber, will not be lectured to by the Labor Party on this as they pitch to defend themselves from attacks from the Greens to the left of them on the political spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about being disconnected from the Australian people. Those same Australian people sent us here at the last election because we stood by our plan for technology, not taxes, to not only lower Australia's emissions but allow Australia to export lower emissions technology to the entire world. Our track record on this speaks for itself. Emissions are 20.8 per cent below 2005 levels. We beat our Kyoto era target by 459 million tonnes. For context, that's the equivalent of taking every car in Australia off the road for a decade. We didn't do that with a carbon tax. We didn't do it with some surprise that we lobbed on the Australian people after the election. We did it with a clear plan and an ambition, and then we set about working in this place, partnering with industry and embracing technology, to deliver it. That is what people expect of a government here in Australia. That is what you understand when you are not disconnected from the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So whilst emissions are lower than in any year during the previous Labor government, they're also at their lowest level since 1990. That matters to some people, but the thing that matters to Australian businesses, particularly those in the heavy manufacturing sector, to which Senator O'Neill referred, is power prices, which have fallen for 10 consecutive quarters year on year. That's 19 months in a row of electricity price reductions in Australia, 48 per cent lower—sorry, 23 consecutive quarters of year-on-year increases in household prices was the track record of the Labor government. Our record is 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year CPI reductions in retail power. The Labor Party's record is not only a carbon tax and not only a mining tax but also 23 consecutive quarters of year-on-year increases in household electricity costs, and they have the hide to come in here and lecture us. Well, the Australian people can see straight through that. They understand that this is the same old Labor Party, because recently we've seen the Labor Party put their dirty little secret out there into the public. Asked on Sunday by David Speers, Senator Gallagher said, 'We are looking at everything.' That was in response to a direct question as to whether or not a carbon tax—</span>

                  </a>  I'm delighted to return to talking about the Morrison government's plan to achieve net zero with technology, not taxes. That is the ironclad guarantee that the Prime Minister has given the people of Australia. There is no plan from the Morrison government that includes a carbon tax. Not only does it not include a carbon tax; in fact, it includes no penalties. We have been clear with the Australian people that we will achieve net zero emissions with technology, not taxes, with choice, not constraint, with incentive, not penalty, and we will deliver it in partnership with the private sector—the private sector that generates the jobs that Australians depend on, the private sector that will export new energy technology to the world. That is what this government is about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delighted to stand on our track record. We put our plans to the Australian people each election, and that is the accountability that matters. Before the next election, the Prime Minister has been clear that we will, in fact, have a very clear plan for the Australian people. It'll be costed, it'll be achievable and it will be based on the outcomes that we have delivered. The Labor Party's plan, which doesn't exist, includes a legislated target which is a blank cheque. With a blank cheque and a carbon tax on the table, I think I know who the Australian people will trust. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator AYRES:</span>
                  </a>  I withdraw that. The Prime Minister said, 'If you have a go, you'll get a go.' Well, this is the Prime Minister's 21st go over eight years at getting climate and energy policy right and we're seeing the consequences. Just like a kid who campaigns against the HSC for all of their period in high school and then suddenly starts studying for the exams in the last two days, this Prime Minister, this coalition, is falling apart at the Glasgow hurdle, and now we've got the Glasgow gaslighting show. It's a pantomime that's been constructed to try and get the Prime Minister through the next two weeks and then through to the election. It is the worst pantomime in Australian theatrical history, with the least compelling cast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has some problems, this shift to net zero from the Prime Minister. Like Mr Morrison, it is fake. Like Mr Morrison, it is a fraud. And, like Mr Morrison, it is all marketing and no substance, because he is a man who believes in nothing. There is zero credibility in this switch to net zero. In the review of this pantomime, let's deal with problem 1: the National Party. Plot credibility for this pantomime requires that they pretend to fight for some regional interest. The fighters for the squatters and the pastoralists have decayed and deteriorated into a bunch of jumped-up bunyip aristocracy who fight for property developers, real estate agents, water speculators and spivs and who couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. That's the problem. This whole plot rests on the idea that the National Party could fight—and they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. I wish we had some heavy hitters. There's no Reg Withers. There's no Doug Anthony. There's no Peter Nixon. There's no Ian Sinclair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at them, what a bunch of pathetic specimens they are. There is Senator Canavan. He wouldn't make an impression on a feather bed. He is a former KPMG guy, a former pseudo-economist and ministerial staffer. He dresses up in the hi-vis, puts on the make-up and pretends to be a coalminer. There is Senator McKenzie. All we've seen is whingeing and whining and backstabbing and leaking and moaning. But we haven't seen any fighting, and we haven't seen any delivery. The best way you can assess future performance is, of course, on past performance. Of course, the only thing that we have seen as a policy proposal from this decaying carcass of a once-great political party has been from Minister Pitt, who proposed a $250 billion line of credit—$10,000 dollars of public money for every man, woman and child in Australia—that would be allocated to an industry that doesn't want it. Senator Canavan, who has enough memory of economics 101, told us that it would have such a distortionary effect on the Australian economy that it would put up interest rates—and he said that was a good thing—lifting mortgage costs, lifting business costs and pushing jobs overseas. That's what we've had from the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Problem No. 2, of course, is the Prime Minister, who's a fraud, a phoney and a fake. He wants to say one thing in Glasgow, another thing in Gunnedah and something entirely different in Glen Waverley. He wants a credible position for Glasgow and he wants to go and say something completely different in Gladstone. Then he'll sneak back to Sydney and try to convey to people in New South Wales that he has a serious message on climate change in Georges Hall. You can't spend 10 years sucking up to climate sceptics, science deniers and cranks and then expect that you can execute a complete U-turn on climate and energy policy. How many jobs has this cost? How much has it cost ordinary families? This is a fraud, a phoney and a fake and it has been seen for what it is. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) to a question without notice I asked today relating to Anti-Poverty Week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week is Anti-Poverty Week, and you would have thought that the government might have tried to sound a bit sympathetic this week to people who are caught up in the whirlpool of poverty, but no. Not only couldn't Minister Ruston bring herself to condemn the appalling words of former New South Wales Liberal minister Pru Goward; Minister Ruston doubled down. Although saying that the government was very concerned about vulnerable people, when it came to the crunch she could not even bring herself to state the bleeding obvious: that the JobSeeker rate of $44 a day is totally inadequate and that it condemns people to lead lives of abject poverty. Balance was what she said it was all about. We can't have income support that's too generous, otherwise people won't have the incentive to go out and get a job. For that, read: 'We have to make you desperate enough to try to get work that more than likely is going to be underpaid, that more than likely is going to exploit you, that more than likely is going to be totally insecure and/or dangerous.' That's what this balance is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her uncaring answer just made me furious. It reflected the uncaring brutality of this government that, frankly, does not care that over a million people are living in poverty in Australia. It made me furious, but I've got a well-paid job. In listening to her answer, I wondered: how would people living in poverty on JobSeeker feel about how their government feels about them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm thinking about the people I've recently spoken with. I've had the community affairs portfolio for just over a month, since Senator Siewert resigned, and I've taken the opportunity to reach out to a whole lot of organisations and a whole lot of people. I'm thinking about Isabel. Isabel is a 26-year-old trans women living on JobSeeker in Brisbane. She told me she lives in chronic pain and cannot spend a lot of time standing, which makes it extremely difficult for her to work. She also lives with severe mental health issues, which have been exacerbated by social isolation and relying on JobSeeker. She told me: 'Being on JobSeeker makes you feel like you're disgusting and reviled. If you can't pay a bill, people look at you like you've spat on their face. The narrative around JobSeeker is constructed in a way that tells people you want to be poor.' When I asked Isabel what it was like to find secure housing on the JobSeeker payment, she said that, as a trans woman, it was scary. She said: 'As a trans woman, I need to be in a place where I am safe from possible victimisation. I need to reduce my risk of victimisation. I need to find places I can afford but places that are queer-friendly.' She fears that, if she ever had to move out from where she lives, there would be limited options that are both safe and affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is unacceptable. The answer to my question today was basically demonising people like Isabel. Isabel should be able to find a safe place to live as a trans women. When I asked Isabel what it was like receiving the COVID supplement last year, when the JobSeeker rate was doubled, she said: 'When it started, the impact on my general wellbeing, essentially at the same time I realised I was trans—it gave me the ability to get through a healthcare system that is not just institutionally gate-kept but also financially gate-kept. I had freedom. I didn't think they would drop us back into hell. But they very slowly did, over a few months.' She told me: 'On $80 a day, realistically, I could probably fix my life. The distance from where I am now to where I need to be could be reduced. But, at the moment, on the current rate, it is unconquerable.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is people like Isabel that I feel for. On hearing Senator Ruston's answer to my question today, they would feel like it was a kick in the guts—that this government is brutally uncaring and does not have any empathy at all for what they are going through. What I want to say to Isabel and the millions of people who are surviving in poverty on JobSeeker is that this government is not listening and we've got to kick them out. But I hear you. The Greens hear you. We know that $44 a day is a pittance and we know we need to raise the rate for good. To do that, we are going to have to turf this uncaring, heartless government out of office.</span>

The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, agreement in November 2020, by Australia and 14 other countries, signalled a shared commitment to opening up new trade and investment opportunities and support for rules based trading arrangements. Ratification of RCEP by the government would deliver significant benefits for Australia and for Australians. RCEP brings together in a single economic framework nine of Australia's top 15 trading partners, which together account for nearly 60 per cent of our trade and about two-thirds of our exports. The amendments to the Customs Act, and the related amendments to be made to the Customs Tariff Act, are required to implement the RCEP agreement. These amendments provide the rules that allow importers to determine if their goods qualify for a preferential tariff treatment. This agreement will lock in market access and address non-tariff barriers, creating significant new trade and investment opportunities for Australia across the Indo-Pacific region. It will also establish rules that provide greater certainty and improve the business environment across the region. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

Economic modelling of trade agreements is only one tool, though, in the box of available tools to assess their economic benefits. Statistical and methodological limitations affect the accuracy of modelling the total impact of an FTA on the economy. Many of the benefits to Australia from participation in the RCEP are also difficult to quantify. These include benefits like: deeper economic engagement, enhanced trade rules as a culture in the Indo-Pacific, strengthening Australia's trade relationship with our ASEAN partners, and contributing to an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific—which I'm sure you would agree, Senator Patrick, aligns with Australia's strategic interests. It would be difficult for economic analysis to quantify the benefits to the Australian economy specifically from RCEP, given the overlap that exists between RCEP and Australia's other multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to precisely model the impact of changes to non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation measures, increased regulatory certainty and rules of origin. Statistics on international trading services and investment flows are also incomplete, which can also affect the utility of modelling. Furthermore, outcomes in important areas such as services and trade facilitating rules don't lend themselves to economic modelling. We expect most of the impact of RCEP to be in areas such as market access for service providers and investors, improvements in governance and business environment in some of the developing countries in the RCEP, or improved access to regional value chains that result from RCEP's rules of origin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there is significant evidence that reducing barriers to Australian exports is going to be beneficial for Australia. The national interest analysis for RCEP, which was tabled in parliament with the treaty text on 18 March 2021, supports the government's view that ratifying RCEP would be in the national interest. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021. The primary purpose of the Hayne royal commission was to look at the banks, but a considerable part of its focus ended up squarely on the financial advisory sector. With this legislation, the government seeks to place more responsibility and liability on financial advisory services, while, under the government's national consumer credit legislation schedule 1, the banks would have absolutely no responsibility if the government amendments were to proceed. Is it because the banks make large donations to the major political parties that they are being protected? I'm only thinking out loud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made it clear to both the government and the public at large that I would never support legislation that would absolve the banks of any responsibility for their actions. And yet here we have the government, under this bill, imposing strict liability clauses while waiving the normal standard of the presumption of innocence. While I agree with the scope of this bill, it should be amended to remove strict liability clauses so the presumption of innocence is maintained, as recommended by the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills in its inquiry. Furthermore, the strict liability imposes a reversal of the onus of proof for offences which are minor in comparison to what all Australians have witnessed with breaches of responsibility by Australians banks. Surely all senators must see the contradiction between these bills and the disparity of the liability on both sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Presumption of innocence is one of the essential foundations of a fair judiciary in a representative democracy. Strict liability would essentially place the onus of proof on the defendant, effectively presuming guilt. Despite the committee's recommendation, all of its members in this chamber are not acting to implement it. They're not acting on their own recommendations! It doesn't make sense. It isn't remotely logical. Such is the nature of politics in this place and the reason that public trust in the financial sector and government is abysmally low or non-existent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation also called on the government for the insertion of a clause for requiring that the one-size-fits-all course for financial advisers and stockbrokers provided by the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority be varied to ensure they cater for these two very different disciplines. Therefore, I would now call on the government to ensure that ASIC, as the responsible authority, addresses this disparity in its regulations currently released for comment. There should be separate courses ensuring those who undertake them are suitably qualified for these different roles. It's just not fit for purpose when a stockbroker is being tested on providing advice about social services, as an example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering this legislation, I think it's important to highlight some of the findings of the royal commission. These findings confirmed what many Australians already knew: quite a few financial advisers were in it for themselves and certainly not in it for anyone else. As the old saying goes: 'If you can't be part of the solution, at least you can still make a lot of money by being part of the problem!' That's why the findings were not at all surprising to the many Australians sacrificed on the altar of profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the royal commission observed that, in almost every case it examined, the conduct in question was primarily driven by individuals' pursuit of gain. Sales became all important. Those who dealt with customers became sellers. And the confusion of roles extended well beyond frontline service staff: advisers became sellers, and sellers became advisers. Service to customers took second place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, entities and individuals acted this way because they could. Consumers had little in the way of informed choice, and this created a very uneven playing field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, consumers often dealt with the financial services entity through the intermediary. They would, understandably, believe that that intermediary was acting in their interests, when all too often intermediaries were paid to act in the interest of the provider of the service or product. Legislation requires these conflicts of interests to be managed, but all too often they were resolved in favour of the provider. As the final report noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An intermediary who seeks to 'stand in more than one canoe' cannot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the royal commission observed that, too often, financial services entities that broke the law were not properly held to account. It stated:</span>

But the community also expects that financial services entities that break the law will be held to account.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation attempts to implement the government's response to recommendation 2.10 of the royal commission to establish a new disciplinary system for financial advisers and provide for a single central disciplinary body. The government says this will involve expanding the Financial Services and Credit Panel within the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to operate as the single body and ensure less serious misconduct doesn't go unaddressed; creating new penalties and sanctions; introducing a new registration system to improve transparency and accountability; and transferring functions from the Financial Advisers Standards and Ethics Authority to the minister and ASIC. </span>

Financial sector reform is absolutely critical to meet the community's expectations. This government must ensure accountability and transparency in the financial services sector; equally, it should do so in the banking sector. It's not only in the interests of everyday Australians but in the interests of the financial sector itself. I call on senators to seriously consider supporting my amendments to make this a better piece of legislation. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021. The bill implements recommendation 2.10 of the Hayne royal commission, which recommended that a single disciplinary body be established for financial advisers. Labor supports this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been reviewed by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and I support the comments made by Senators Chisholm and Walsh in the committee's report which call on the government to strongly consider the views of consumer advocates and 'consider appointing representatives with appropriate consumer experience and sectoral knowledge to the Financial Services and Credit Panel'. But of course Labor still does support this bill. Indeed, Labor have been very clear that we seek to rapidly progress any legislation that appropriately implements the findings of the Hayne royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this enthusiasm has not been shared by the Morrison government. The Prime Minister infamously voted against a royal commission into the banks 26 times—26 times! Now, we know the Prime Minister hates nothing more than being held accountable for his decisions, and he was determined to extend the same courtesy to the big banks. The royal commission found these same banks to have engaged in shocking behaviour. They were ripping off and rorting thousands of Australians. Some of the rorting would almost make the Morrison government blush—almost. This is how widespread the rot is in the financial services sector, and the Prime Minister voted against a royal commission into that industry 26 times, on 26 separate occasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very fortunate for the thousands of the victims of this financial exploitation around Australia that Labor and the crossbench were so determined to bring the royal commission about. While we were pushing for a royal commission, Mr Morrison was going on television and saying, 'It's nothing more than a populist whinge.' In another interview he called it 'a reckless distraction'. That is very strong language from the Prime Minister. I have never heard him use that sort of language to support hardworking Australians when they're under attack, such as the 2,000 workers whose jobs were outsourced by Qantas last year—this was while Qantas was receiving $2 billion in taxpayers' money from the Prime Minister to keep them employed. The Prime Minister hasn't lifted a finger to support them, even after they won their landmark case against Qantas in the Federal Court earlier this year. And even though many of those Qantas workers live in his own electorate of Cook, it really goes to show what side the Prime Minister is on. If you're an outsourced Qantas worker, you get nothing from Mr Morrison. You don't even get access to the latest aviation support the government has announced. That only goes to direct airline employees. But if you're the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, you're in luck. Mr Morrison will go in to bat for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remind Mr Morrison about what the royal commission actually discovered was happening in the financial services sector. Here is what the 'populist whinge', as Mr Morrison referred to it, actually revealed. The corporate regulator, ASIC, revealed 90 per cent of financial advisers who provided advice to self-managed superannuation funds had failed to comply with the best interests of their clients—90 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of largest companies in Australia—the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, AMP and Westpac—had continued to charge clients for advice and life insurance after they had died. AMP alone admitted to continuing to charge life insurance premiums to more than 4,600 of their dead customers. There were widespread reports of fees for no service not just to the dead but also to the living. The big banks were forced to pay over $1.2 billion in compensation for fees for no service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission heard that the NAB's Introducer Payments Program had paid exorbitant sums of money to accountants, tailors and gym owners to push their clients into unsuitable home loans. One introducer, who worked as a tailor, had successfully pushed his clients into $122 million worth of home loans, and reaped $488,000 in fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Bank admitted to offering repeated credit card limit increases to a customer who was begging them to stop because he had a gambling addiction and was already $30,000 in debt. The Commonwealth Bank also admitted to selling credit card insurance to 60,000 ineligible unemployed customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance giant Allianz admitted it sold junk insurance to 68,000 Australians. That is insurance that provided little or no actual benefit. Now, Allianz wasn't alone. IAG also sold junk insurance to 68,000 people. Suncorp sold junk insurance to more than 41,000 people. And QBE sold junk insurance to more than 35,000 people. One of the biggest life insurance companies in Australia, TAL, abruptly stopped paying insurance to a woman with cervical cancer because TAL discovered she had sought help for completely unrelated mental health issues years before her cancer diagnosis. ASX-listed Freedom Insurance was exposed for cold-calling a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome and selling him more than $100,000 in life insurance. When the man's father complained, Freedom's staff ridiculed him and called him a whinger. That same company was also exposed as having tried to hang on to customers when they tried to cancel insurance policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission heard about how banks have ripped off small businesses, particularly in regional Australia. ANZ threatened one farming couple with bankruptcy if they didn't sell their sheep, farm and home to come up with $300,000 within just eight days. The commission heard about the disgraceful exploitation of Indigenous Australians by funeral insurance companies. Some families were paying for four or five different funeral insurance policies at a time without their consent or knowledge. These are just a few of the disgraceful stories that came to light through the banking royal commission, the commission Mr Morrison voted against 26 times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government could have redeemed itself by quickly implementing the commissioner's 76 recommendations, but, 2½ years after that final report was handed down, just 27 of the 76 recommendations have been implemented. That is just 36 per cent. That is a failing grade in any marking system. If the Morrison government were implementing the royal commission recommendations any slower, you could mistake it for their vaccine rollout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you open up Commissioner Hayne's report and start counting through the recommendations, it doesn't take long to find where the Morrison government lost interest: recommendation 1.1, literally the first recommendation, the most basic and fundamental recommendation to come out of the royal commission. Recommendation 1.1 said that the government should not water down responsible lending obligations on the banks, and what has the government done? It has introduced a bill to do exactly that, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, which has already passed through the House. It has been lingering on the Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for months like a bad smell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government issued its official response to the royal commission, the Treasurer said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we committed to taking action on all 76 Royal Commission recommendations and, in a number of important areas, going further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's press release went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">by the end of 2020, remaining Royal Commission recommendations requiring legislation will have been introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That deadline was 10 months ago, and we've barely scratched the surface. The truth is that the government never had any intention of implementing most of these recommendations. We know Mr Morrison did not want this royal commission, because he voted against it 26 times, and we know now that Mr Morrison did not want to implement its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But why does Morrison not want to hold the banks to account? Firstly, because, if Mr Morrison began holding the banks accountable for their actions, where would it end? The Prime Minister would risk creating an expectation that the rich and powerful in Australia can be held to account, and that would end up coming right back to Mr Morrison's own door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another reason why the Morrison government won't hold the banks to account: it's because the Morrison government is so close to the big bank lobbyists that one of those lobbyists was even elected to the Senate: the senator for the Financial Services Council, Senator Bragg. Senator Bragg worked at the lobbying group for the financial services industry, the Financial Services Council, for eight years, from 2009 to 2017. While Mr Morrison was voting against the royal commission and calling it a populist whinge in August 2016, Senator Bragg was working as director of policy for the Financial Services Council, and now they are in government together. The foxes are well and truly in the henhouse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only part of the financial services sector that we know the Morrison government is interested in fighting is industry super funds, which happen to be one part of the financial services sector that came out of the royal commission with reputation largely intact. Industry super funds return all profits to their members. They perform better on average. They have lower fees. They have not engaged in the sort of disgraceful conduct uncovered by the royal commission. And yet time and time again the government introduces bills to try and lure more unsuspecting Australians into the retail super shark tank. The government uses none other than the Financial Services Council lobbyist himself, Senator Bragg. When trust in democracy and trust in parliament is at an all-time low in Australia, this really sums it all up. Who is the chief attack dog on industry super? Senator Bragg. We have a government that never wanted a royal commission into misconduct by the most powerful companies in Australia, the big banks. When they were finally forced into setting it up, they pretended to accept all the recommendations and only actually implemented 36 per cent of them. Then, to cover this all up, they brought the lobbyist for those financial institutions, Senator Bragg, into the Senate. Then the government used Senator Bragg to attack the one part of the financial services sector that was shown to be doing the right thing: industry super funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August the government quietly dropped new regulations to mislead more Australians into higher-fee retail funds. According to these new regulations, super funds will only be assessed on the administration fee they charged in the most recent financial year. The performance test was originally based on the average fee charged over the past eight years. This is an absolute joke. The new performance testing laws were passed through the Senate only a few months ago, and in the space of a month the government passed a regulation to completely change how the performance testing is conducted. Because the testing ignores the fees that high-fee retail funds have charged over the last eight years, retail funds will be able to misrepresent the returns they have delivered. The government knows this is a complete misrepresentation. That's why they didn't include it in the legislation that was passed in parliament. They waited a few weeks and snuck it into regulations instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not on the side of any Australian seeking the best returns for their super money. This government is not on the side of any Australian who wants a fair and equitable relationship with their bank. This is a government which hires bank lobbyists as senators and voted 26 times against a royal commission. Setting aside for a moment the 49 royal commission recommendations which are being left to wither and die on the vine, Labor supports this bill. This bill unfortunately implements just one recommendation of the royal commission. It's a shame it has taken so long and this is just one of the many overdue recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note and support Senator Gallagher's amendment that the Senate note the government's failure to act on the recommendations more broadly and Senator Patrick's amendment to require the government to show the Senate its draft regulations before this bill is passed. We have already seen, with the Your Future, Your Super laws, that this government will sneak in despicable regulations whenever it can. I urge the Morrison government to stand up and hold the hose this time and clean up the banking and financial services sector, not continue to lie doggo on it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I rise to make a brief contribution on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021. I indicate to the chamber that I won't be moving my second reading amendment. The purpose of the second reading amendment was to refer the bill back to committee because the regulations had not been tabled. They have now been made available. I just want to say thank you to the Senate for standing up. The Senate indicated, through the whips system—or at least through the system that we all know takes place in the back rooms of this building to indicate whether or not there is support for an amendment such as the one that I was planning to move—that I had the numbers. The government knew that and then dropped the bill from the list, went away and produced the regulations. My office has now had some further consultation with the industry and with Senator Hume's office. There's been a little bit of argy-bargy, and there are some things I would like to have changed further. I accept I don't have the numbers on those, so, ultimately, I will support the bill. It's not perfect, but I won't let that be the enemy of the good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In general, I would like to say thank you to the Senate. When I made my dissenting report to the committee, it was based on the principle that the first provision in our Constitution is that it is the responsibility of the parliament to make the laws. Whilst regulations have a place, it is not proper for someone to walk into this chamber and thump down half a law, to provide only half the picture, because often the devil is in the detail of the regulations. By indicating support for my second reading amendment, the Senate has forced the government to do the right thing. That is a good thing. I might just encourage senators: that probably sends a signal to the government for all future bills that the Senate is at least willing to delay things until such time as the regulations are tabled with the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My advisers have now been forewarned that if the regulations aren't tabled with a bill I will automatically move a similar second reading amendment, and the minister will have to take a pot shot as to whether or not the bill will progress through the chamber. That's a really, really good thing. I would ask that senators consider this in relation to things like referrals to the Privileges Committee, the insistence upon compliance with orders of the Senate and the proper answering of questions by officials before the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in the unique situation of having the Australian public as our boss. We're at the very, very top of the chain. Unlike other bodies, where there's someone looking over and saying, 'No, you've got to do things in a particular way,' it's up to us. If we stand firm on things, then we will get much, much better process occurring. If we stand firm on things, we'll get much better answers. So I'm hopeful that, when the Privileges Committee considers some of the matters that are before it, it will recognise that when the Senate stands together we can actually change the way in which others treat us in this building, and if we don't stand together, if we don't stand up, make a point and take a stand, then we leave ourselves at the mercy of poor process and poor answers, and that doesn't help us with our oversight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021. I note the contribution of my Labor colleague Senator Sheldon, who gave a very fine and detailed contribution to the debate on this bill just before Senator Patrick's contribution. For those who are interested in what's really going on and the great shame of the government's failure to respond properly to the Hayne royal commission, I urge you to review Senator Sheldon's words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The subtitle of this bill, 'Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021', is like the window-dressing of a shop where you go inside and find it really hasn't got anything you want to buy. This should be called 'One Tiny Recommendation Change From a Whole Lot of Work That Hasn't Got Done by the Government Around the Hayne Royal Commission, Despite the Fact That They Promised You That They Would Accept It All Bill.' That should be its title, because that would be telling the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of you who are in the chamber and in the local community will absolutely know of my long interest in the financial planning industry and the financial services sector and in the sustainability of the financial planning industry and its continued operation. However, I am continually troubled by reports from my contacts in the sector that the regulations are not promoting an ethical and transparent industry. Rather, this government's poor consultation and ignorance of the nuances in financial planning has meant that adviser numbers have fallen by nearly a third in the last few years. The industry is withering on the vine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge early work done by Senator Fawcett when he was the chair of the corporations and financial services committee. I was very pleased to work with him on that committee and deliver a bit of a road map for how things could roll out. Unfortunately, care in the rollout wasn't taken by this government, which turned its attentions to things like rorts and getting itself re-elected over actually serving the Australian people. The consequences are what we see today: this broken industry of vital importance to Australians' financial wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hayne royal commission, if people can remember it, rocked the entire Australian financial industry to its core and ushered in some much-needed and long-overdue changes. It held many white-collar criminals accountable and it sent a clear message to the industry that practices like overcharging or fees for no service are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. That was the mega-message: you can't charge money for nothing. That was it, in a nutshell. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the best intentions are often not followed through by the government, who have failed to ensure action was taken and to deliver appropriate regulation. This has certainly impacted on the financial advisers who provide such important guidance to Australians who want to grow their wealth and manage their finances in a way that gives them the best sense of having independence, particularly as they age. I'm hearing very troubling stories of adviser suicides, and I don't say that lightly. I urge anybody who is triggered by me mentioning that to seek advice from Lifeline or any of the other great institutions that provide support in our community, such as the Black Dog Institute. But I am very concerned to hear that people who were running successful businesses have become so despairing of the capacity to run their business that they've seen no way forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They tell me also of the ongoing impact of their requirement to pay ASIC payments that are invoiced after the fact, at the end of their year of work. It's really impacting on those businesses very significantly.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'NEILL:</span>
                    </a>  I can hear noises coming from Senator Hume, who is here, and I do know that there have been some announcements by the government. But everyone in Australia knows that announcements by the government and action by the government are two very, very different things. So there is a slowly diminishing pool of advisers, and that is further increasing the costs. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> now predicts that the costs of receiving financial advice have risen 12 percent in the last year due to a patchwork of poor regulation from a government that says it understands business and actually is good at managing your money but is proving itself to be absolutely not in line with that articulation of its own version of itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As reported to me by a local Central Coast adviser: 'If the government were looking to destroy a profession, drive up fees and push out any non-institutional advice firm, they couldn't have done a better job. We must look towards regulating this industry in a fit-for-purpose manner.' That's a voice from the industry itself that has been willing to speak to the government, has been waiting to speak to the government, has been wanting to speak to the government for three years and got the big hand and told, 'Don't talk to me.' That's the problem: this government is more interested in its own survival than the survival of hardworking Australian businesspeople and the jobs that they provide for our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that sits before us, as Senator Sheldon very clearly outlined, implements just one recommendation—that's recommendation 2.10—of the Hayne royal commission by establishing a single disciplinary body for financial advisers and legislating the requirement that all financial advisers who provide personal financial advice to retail clients be registered. It also implements recommendation 7.1 of the Tax Practitioners Board review, which recommended that a new model be developed for regulating financial advisers in alignment with the implementation of recommendation 2.10 of the financial services royal commission final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's also going to wind up FASEA and transfer its functions to the Financial Services and Credit Panel within ASIC to streamline regulation and ensure that all cases of misconduct are dealt with. It also creates new penalties and sanctions for financial advisers who breach their obligations under the Corporations Act, as well as a new registration system for advisers. The Hayne royal commission recommended this regulation after it found that the financial advice sector lacked an appropriate regime for dealing with professional misconduct. So, basically, it was like a cowboy's club—you could get away with doing anything; no-one was watching—and it fed on itself and competed with itself in a race to the bottom in terms of service provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission identified a need to streamline all complaints into a one-stop shop, rather than the multitude of avenues previously in place, and to introduce less severe penalties to deal with minor events as ASIC had investigated and punished only serious complaints due to the top-heavy penalties available to it. There you have the reveal of a government that doesn't do its day job properly. It shows up, collects the pay on the way through, comes in to govern as little as possible, and just lets the market rip. Even when it's given guidelines and recommendations by its own committees—committees of the Senate, committees of the House, experts who want to talk to it—it just ignores so much of the really hard work that has to be done and show up for power's sake only. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the implementation of the regulations that are proposed here, because, for too long, malicious financial advisers had engaged in the worst kind of rent-seeking behaviours—fees for no service, grandfather commissions, in-house product sales that posed as independent advice from planners locked into dealer networks. The royal commission revealed that, in 2018, roughly 65 per cent of the financial advisers didn't hold a relevant university degree and that there was a culture of ensuring revenue before ensuring service. Commissioner Hayne described it as the three most common types of misconduct—and I thought this was very pithy and absolutely accurate—'selling what you can't deliver, selling what you won't deliver and selling what you don't deliver'. That was the practice described by Commissioner Hayne into what was going on in the financial services sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The power imbalance between planners, the dealers group network—by which a large financial institution would hold an AFSL—and registered planners has come under scrutiny during and after the royal commission, particularly regarding the AMP advisers, who were profoundly affected by a buyer of last resort catastrophe with AMP. As with franchisees and franchisors and a non-unionised worker and a boss, the power imbalance between those two entities resulted in terrible consequences for smaller players and incredible profits for big banks, which got themselves an AFSL and then brought all of these young inexperienced people in with no qualifications and started trotting them out as financial advisers, some of them with only eight hours online training. They were sent out to take people's entire life savings into their hands and direct it on a pathway that was for the benefit of the banks' wealth arms rather than for the benefit of the consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the ASIC levy, on paper it sounds like a great reform, charging financial institutions a levy to pay for investigations into malfeasance. But most of the large financial institutions, the banks, were the ones who the royal commission found responsible for the type of behaviour I just described. Most of the malfeasance was theirs, but they rapidly existed the market and exempted themselves from the levy. That left the levy to be paid by the remaining advisers, the decent ones that were still hanging around, lots of them small and medium businesses. Subsequently, the costs have been borne by them and have risen exponentially. This year it's predicted to rise another 30 per cent, and even the most diligent and careful advisers are being billed for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The small and independent financial advice sector has been devastated by the government's changes and poor implementation of the royal commission recommendations. The FASEA exams have been described to me as appalling and irrelevant to the financial services industry, despite their good intent and dire need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were roughly 28,000 financial advisers; now there are 19,000. It's expected that more and more of them will fall. ASIC had reported that 6,500 had left the industry, but only 163 had joined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big four banks have all retreated from the wealth management market and they've jettisoned their advisory arms. While I support a more independent network that's more agile and less dependent on big financial institutions, this move only reinforces that many financial institutions no longer see the sector as profitable without a large portion of them selling their in-house product for their profit or without corrupt and exploitative practices that were exposed during the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill isn't a panacea. It doesn't fix or resolve the current issues that threaten the sustainability of the Australian financial planning sector. It does propose some noble and needed reforms that will make the sector stronger and more ethical, but it shouldn't stop here. The government can't just wash its hands of the financial planning sector. It needs to actually listen to the financial planners and adjust the reform package to make the industry more viable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing as we've been talking about regional Australia—and I do live in a region of Australia that is outside a major city—I know what it's like when your kids can't ever get a bus to work because there's no public transport system, where jobs are hard to come by and are very insecure, where wages are less than you get in the cities and where we are often overlooked by this government, and where—conveniently!—we on the Central Coast are joined into and out of Greater Sydney at the will of the state government. I live in one of those regional areas and I travel around this wide state very, very frequently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial planning businesses that were vital in places like Dubbo, Albury and Wagga Wagga all got caught up in this. They did not get proper representation by the Nationals members that they sent to this parliament. Their voices weren't heard. And the services that they provided have disappeared, and the jobs that they created and provided have disappeared. It's not good enough. This is not a government that looks after small businesses. It is not a government that understands wealth creation for Australia, because, if they did, they would have done a much better job in the eight years that they've been in than this single amendment at this stage.</span>

Before I begin, I want to associate myself with the remarks of Senator O'Neill and acknowledge Senator O'Neill's incredible advocacy and thoughtful work in this area. She has been a true champion of reform here. Few people understand the details better than Senator O'Neill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hayne royal commission made it absolutely clear that the Australian financial industry, on too many occasions, had failed to adequately serve its customers and, in far too many cases, operated against the best interests of customers. The royal commission rocked Australia, as we knew it would; that's why we called for it. We knew how critical it was that a royal commission investigated these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We knew that consumers and businesses were being impacted by the unscrupulous conduct of actors in this space. They were telling the government this loudly and clearly, and the government ignored them. They voted against establishing a royal commission 26 times. They only capitulated because of pressure from their own backbench, but they voted against this 26 times. We saw dud efforts at reform which didn't work, as they tried to protect an industry which desperately needed scrutiny from that scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been nearly three years now since Commissioner Hayne handed down his report to the government. Frustratingly, the response has been on the go-slow. We are still dealing with legislation to deal with individual recommendations contained in this report. Indeed, as Senator Sheldon said, this bill deals with just one. It is classic Prime Minister Morrison: too little, too late. He was dragged there too late because he did not care. He did not care—26 times voting against this. The government put protecting Australian consumers on the backburner and dithered in implementing these reforms, just like they dithered in having the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Failing to tackle these reforms head-on and urgently has real-world consequences for families. This kind of acting in this space, these behaviours, when families were being ripped off by financial advisers and institutions, tears apart lives. It takes homes away, it takes futures away and it crushes dignity and security in retirement when institutions fail to act in the best interests of their customers. And the consequences are devastating, not just for individual consumers but for businesses—small and medium enterprises who take on risk based on advice, who rely on this advice, who rely on honesty and accuracy in their dealings with these institutions. When these interests aren't protected and those businesses fail, of course it's not just the operators of these businesses who suffer but also the employees who work in them, the employees who rely on these businesses to be successful, because that's how they get their job, that's how they pick up their pay packet at the end of the week as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that Australian families and businesses should be able to access financial services and advice confident that the law protects them from being taken for granted by bad actors. We knew this was happening for a long time—that's why we needed the royal commission, that's why we called for it and that's why we fought for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make the point here that good financial advice really matters. Good financial advice for families can be the difference of delivering their aspirations to them or not. It can be the difference of delivering financial security and the difference in delivering dignity and security in retirement or not. It can be the difference between a family being able to own their own home or not. Advice needs to be high quality, it needs to be accessible and it needs to be affordable, and this is the challenge for government, for regulators, so we don't have a situation, which we have seen, where customers are getting costed out of getting advice, costed out of the support they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those in the industry struggling, as Senator O'Neill acknowledged, I want to acknowledge you too—I want to acknowledge the impacts of this government's delay and dithering and dud efforts of reform on your industry and on your work. Those experienced financial advisers who we know do the right thing by their clients deserve clarity, not uncertainty and not unnecessary costs. We need to get this right. We need to get it right for consumers, we need to get it right for those people who have suffered at the hands of unscrupulous actors, we need to get it right for industry. To make sure that it's working, we need regulation that is fit for purpose and that gets this balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has always—always!—stumped up with too little, too late. We've seen it in the pandemic response, we've seen it on climate change, we've seen it on aged care, we've seen it on early education and care, and we see it crystal clear on this important area of financial sector reform. Never forget he voted against this royal commission 26 times—this critical work which exposed horrific stories from consumers and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that this legislation deals with one of those recommendations. It goes part of the way to getting there, but there is more we need to do to be supporting this sector and to be supporting Australian consumers to make sure that there's a genuine listening to the calls of those who presented to the royal commission, those who have suffered. This is urgent reform work, and please get on with it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  Like other Australians, I have had an absolute gutful of wrongdoing in the financial sector, wrongdoing that could have been abated with a royal commission that had been instigated in a timely fashion instead of this government having voted against it some 26 times. I have seen the very real and tangible losses absolutely devastating lives, and the tail of that continues to drag on because of this government's failings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Future of Financial Advice—FOFA—reforms which required an annual opt-in to commission so people couldn't simply have money taken out of their accounts without their knowing was opposed by the Liberal Party year after year. Senator Bragg, who considers himself an expert in these matters, finally confessed that the Liberals had done the wrong thing in opposing it. And their opposition to the royal commission demonstrates that for too long we've had a government that's been in the pockets of the financial services industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This long awaited bill, the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021, implements recommendations of the Hayne royal commission as well as the Tax Practitioners Board review final report. We know we need laws that have a proper framework for disciplinary systems for financial advisers—the previous system failed us manifestly. And finally we have before us a system that requires financial advisers who provide financial advice to retail clients to be registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen the dire consequences of a lack of registration in terms of those who have access to tribunals like AFCA and whether they will or won't get a hearing and whether they will or won't get compensation. And yet we see, in the minds of consumers, the difficulties they had, particularly in the background, while the royal commission was being called for. I think about the victims of the Sterling financial collapse. They heard in the background: 'We can't trust financial systems. We can't trust the government. We can't trust what's going on. I'm going to opt for this particular scheme because it looks as though it's going to be bankable and it's guaranteed.' In fact, as we know, those are the very kinds of schemes that needed ironclad regulation and the effective oversight of government to prevent their losses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really quite telling, when you listen to people who have been affected by bad financial advice, the way they have thought about it. In many cases, they've been seeking to opt out of what they see as a bad system. It's particularly telling that the breadth of the administration of financial advice left the most vulnerable, in that sense, out in the cold. So I'm pleased that AFSL holders will need to report serious compliance concerns to the disciplinary body and that clients and stakeholders should be able to report information about the conduct of financial advisers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, while we support this bill, we know there's a lot missing, and the way the government has got to this point is frankly embarrassing. This recommendation comes from a government that, for years, has actively worked against a royal commission into this very sector. It's watered down previous protections from FOFA, under the guise of red-tape reduction. Of the hearings that actually took place, when the interim report was finally handed down in 2019, we've seen, again and again, awkward displays from the government in implementing these reforms. The Liberals never wanted FOFA. They never wanted a royal commission. The royal commission itself inquired into the scandals that were going on in wealth management, and even now, years later, we are still catching up on the legacy of all of the problems that the royal commission revealed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to try and truncate my remarks, but I do want to note that my good colleague Senator O'Neill has outlined in detail the roller-coaster that good financial advisers have been on in jumping through the required hoops to meet the standards of these reforms. It's very concerning to me that we've had to go through this over and over again—with these debates having happened over many years and with advocacy that's come to our offices over and over again—and that it's taken all of this time to get to this point. Meanwhile, we see victims of financial collapse, such as the Sterling New Life collapse, still fighting for justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Senate for passing a motion to refer this issue to the Senate economics committee. I've been speaking to these people for many years. I watched what happened to them at the same time as the royal commission started looking at issues. I can't help but think that, if that royal commission had started earlier, there would have been somewhere for these people to go and their losses could, and should, have been prevented. Instead the scheme collapsed and their entire savings were lost. I've seen retirees having to go back into the workforce. I've seen people having to go to court to fight with their landlord in order not to be evicted after they paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent up-front. I've seen people not being able to afford health care. I've seen people kicked out of their homes—homes they have already paid more than $200,000 to rent for the rest of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that ASIC knew about these problems, and we knew that this product was re-registered and re-released. Yet it later collapsed again. We've had many complaints about the scheme, but they did not act in a timely manner to prevent further investments before the scheme collapsed. We know that victims have been told to apply to the Financial Complaints Authority if they want compensation, but in 2020 they suspended the processing of these claims. It really does bring into light the importance of this legislation, because the type of financial adviser you've been through, and the extent to which they're registered, gives you a claim of compensation—for example, before AFCA. So it's incredibly important to see this now tidied up inside this legislation, and I know that it will need to be scrutinised further and more closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen an example currently before the courts where an adviser working for a financial management firm sold a product but, because the firm they worked for hadn't endorsed the sale of that particular product, they managed to get away with these people not having a claim before AFCA. That is extraordinary. I need to dig into whether this particular scheme before the Senate now will actually fix those kinds of problems in the future. It is absolutely extraordinary to me that a financial services company that is making profit off a product that is being sold can get away with saying, 'We didn't endorse that product and, therefore, that client has no claim to compensation and we have no liability for it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these retirees have died while waiting for the government to do the right thing. They were told to wait because there was a new scheme that would help them get compensation—the compensation scheme of last resort—which the government is finalising and is yet to bring before this place. It is a scheme that leaves them out—in part because of the nature of financial advice that they did or didn't get. It is unacceptable and it is inhuman to have people lost in a swamp of bureaucracy when they had confidence that these products were properly regulated. They have been strung along for years and years and years waiting for justice and compensation.</span>

They have conflated unadvised product failure with financial advice. The disrespect—indeed contempt—those opposite have for the financial advice industry can be no better demonstrated than when, as recently as June, in this very chamber, Labor senator Jenny McAllister labelled financial advisers as shonks. She said the people who would benefit most from these arrangements are financial advisers giving shonky advice—the kind of advice we have seen again and again, the kind of advice exposed in the Hayne royal commission. The Australian Association of Financial Advisers said these comments were unfair, unreasonable and doing much damage to the financial advice profession. Enough is enough, and it must stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is focused on cutting red tape, cutting regulatory alignment, creating regulatory alignment and reducing costs for financial advisers and financial advice businesses, which is exactly what the industry has called for. This is the very best way to ensure that Australians can continue to access high-quality, professional and affordable financial advice. The Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response—Better Advice) Bill 2021 is simply one piece of that puzzle.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also committed to implementing its response to the financial services royal commission and is delivering one of its commitments through this legislation. The Hayne royal commission had 76 recommendations for reform. Fifty-four of those were directed to government. This is No. 53, and the final recommendation will be delivered in the form of legislation imminently. The remaining recommendations were to regulators and 10 were to the industry, which I think is worth pointing out to Senator Sheldon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements recommendation 2.10, which recommends the establishment of a single disciplinary body for financial advisers and that all financial advisers who provide personal financial advice to retail clients be registered. The bill expands the role of the Financial Services and Credit Panel within ASIC to take on the role of a single disciplinary body and gives the panel new sanctions powers. The bill also seeks to streamline the number of bodies involved in the oversight of financial advisers by transferring the functions currently undertaken by the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority to the minister responsible for the Corporations Act 2001 and to ASIC. Finally, the bill provides that tax financial advisers will no longer be regulated by the Tax Practitioners Board and instead will be regulated only under the Corporations Act 2001. This is consistent with recommendation 7.1 from the independent review of the Tax Practitioners Broad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reaffirms this government's support for the advice industry, building on measures such as the temporary and targeted relief for financial advisers by reducing the cost recovery levies charged by ASIC for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years. This relief will see ASIC levies charged for personal advice to retail clients restored to their 2018-19 level of $1,142 per adviser for the next two years. This relief will represent a 63 per cent reduction relative to the level estimated in ASIC's 2020-21 cost recovery implementation standard of $3,138 per adviser. So this means that advice businesses will save around $1,996 per adviser per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government recognises that, during the worse days of the pandemic, thousands of Australians turned to their financial advisers and that, for so many Australians, considered advice from a professional and experienced adviser was what helped them through the worst of the COVID induced recession. Ensuring that Australians can continue to access high-quality professional and affordable financial advice is incredibly important as we emerge from the pandemic, and I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the absence of the Chair, I rise to speak to the tabling of the Scrutiny of Bill Committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest 16 of 2021</span>. I take this unusual step at the unanimous request of the committee to highlight the committee's significant scrutiny concerns in relation to several matters arising in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this Digest, the committee has reported on particular scrutiny concerns regarding the Biosecurity Amendment (Enhanced Risk Management) Bill 2021. The bill seeks to amend the Biosecurity Act to provide biosecurity officers with the power to make group directions in relation to classes of individuals where one or more of the individuals exhibit symptoms of a listed human disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A group direction provides biosecurity officers with a number of coercive powers, including requiring individuals to undertake a medical examination or provide a body sample.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has significant scrutiny concerns where bills allow for coercive powers to be exercised in circumstances where there is limited guidance in the primary legislation as to how these powers would be exercised. The committee also raised scrutiny concerns that, as group directions are not legislative instruments, the bill provided limited options for parliamentary scrutiny over the content of the group directions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the committee acknowledges the initial advice provided by the minister in relation to these concerns, the committee is requesting further advice regarding whether the bill can be amended to provide more guidance about the exercise of these coercive powers, including whether safeguards can be introduced into the bill that protect an individual's right to bodily autonomy and an individual's right to provide and withdraw consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is also seeking further advice as to whether amendments can be made to the bill to increase the ability of the Parliament and the public to scrutinise the exercise of these powers. The committee has particular concerns in this case as group directions may only be made in relation to human diseases listed within the Biosecurity (Listed Human Diseases) Determination 2016<span style="font-weight:bold;">, </span>which is exempt from parliamentary disallowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee's concerns are about the lack of parliamentary scrutiny afforded to significant measures is longstanding. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Di</span><span style="font-style:italic;">gest 7 of 2021</span>, the committee reported on the use of exempt instruments made under the Biosecurity Act to implement significant COVID-19 response measures such as the India Travel Pause Determination. That review took place following a recommendation of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation in its report on the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is the view of this committee that delated legislation should only be exempt from disallowance in exceptional circumstances. Exempting an instrument from disallowance directly interferes with proper parliamentary oversight of Commonwealth law and with the constitutionally conferred role of Parliament as the seat of legislative power. Any exemption from disallowance should be considered in the context of its interaction with these considerations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee will generally have heightened concerns in relation to provisions exempting instruments from disallowance where the effect of those instruments would be to confer broad discretion on a decisionmaker, would deal with significant matters, or would unduly impact on an individual's personal rights or liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee considers that a number of provisions within the Biosecurity Act raise these issues, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has served to highlight the importance of Parliament, and in particular the Senate, maintaining a careful and considered watch over how the legislative power that it has delegated is being utilised by the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With these comments, I commend the committee's Scrutiny Digest 16 of 2021 to the Senate.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  I present <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated legislation monitor 15 of 2021</span> of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to the tabling of the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated legislation </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">onitor 15 of 2021</span>. The first instrument I would like to draw to the Senate's attention is the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Variation (Extension No. 3) Instrument 2021. As senators would be well aware, the emergency declaration in relation to COVID-19 was first made on 18 March 2020. This instrument extends the human biosecurity emergency period for a further three months, until 17 December 2021. This means that the emergency period has now been extended on six separate occasions with no opportunity for parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this declaration is that the Minister for Health can continue to determine emergency requirements and give directions that he deems necessary to prevent or control COVID-19. The committee is extremely concerned that significant measures at the Commonwealth level, such as the ban on Australian citizens travelling overseas and the India travel pause, have not been subject to parliamentary oversight. During the committee's hearings last year, evidence was provided regarding the cascading effects of the declaration of a Commonwealth pandemic emergency on state and territory laws. Whilst there are differing laws, the continued presence of the pandemic emergency period has given succour to the imposition of harsh and draconian measures which, similarly, have had little or no scrutiny by state and territory parliaments. Moreover, the continued extension of the emergency period at the Commonwealth level signals to the states that it remains appropriate for restrictive state public health orders to remain in force. Conversely, an end to the Commonwealth emergency period would send a strong message that it is time to return to some level of normality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the committee's view that emergency delegated legislation must be subject to appropriate parliamentary oversight. Continuing to make instruments under the Biosecurity Act which are exempt from the disallowance undermines parliament's constitutional role as the primary institution responsible for making law. The committee appreciates that during an emergency urgent and decisive action must be taken. However, we are now well into the second year of this pandemic, and that excuse is no longer valid. Parliament needs oversight over these critical decisions now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the committee's previous monitor, the committee sought Minister Hunt's advice about whether the government would consider amending the Biosecurity Act to provide that any future emergency determinations and extensions to the emergency period would be subject to disallowance. Yesterday, Minister Hunt advised that he considers that such amendments are not necessary. For these reasons, not only will the committee be seeking the minister's advice about this instrument's exemption from disallowance, but the committee also intends to move amendments to the Biosecurity Amendment (Enhanced Risk Management) Bill 2021, which is currently before the parliament, to reflect the committee's unanimous view that any future determinations and extensions should be subject to disallowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to further note that in December last year the committee tabled its interim report of its inquiry into the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight, which details the concerns which I have raised again today. It is with deep concern that I advise the chamber that the government has still not responded to this report 10 months later, despite the urgent and significant concerns detailed in this report. On this note, I thank the chamber for agreeing to an order for the production of documents earlier today requiring this response to be tabled on the next sitting day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second instrument I raise is the Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Regulations 2021. This instrument amends the Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Regulation 2015 to extend exemptions to disallowance and sunsetting in relation to certain legislative instruments. This includes extending an exemption from disallowance for instructions given under the Air Services Regulations 2019 and an exemption of motor vehicle standards under the Road Vehicle Standards Act 2018 from sunsetting. The committee considers that exemptions from essential parliamentary oversight mechanisms such as disallowance and sunsetting should be outlined in primary rather than delegated legislation and soundly justified in the explanatory materials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, as acknowledged by the chamber in June, exemptions from these crucial oversight mechanisms should only be made in the most limited circumstances. The committee has previously raised these concerns with the Attorney-General. However, the committee considers the AG's response did not sufficiently address these concerns, particularly about the justification for these exemptions and their inclusion in delegated legislation. It is unsatisfactory that the committee's detailed scrutiny, concerns and recommendations in this report about the inappropriateness of most existing exemptions from disallowance appear to have been wholly disregarded in the making of this instrument. For this reason, the committee is seeking the AG's further advice regarding why these exemptions from parliamentary oversight are appropriate and necessary and, if they truly are necessary, whether they can at least be included in primary legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of disallowance, I note that since the changes to the committee's standing orders came into effect on 1 July, the committee has so far considered 35 instruments which are exempt from disallowance. Of these 35, only one has met the committee's standards and is appropriately exempt. That is less than three per cent, and it is not good enough. This is an issue that the committee will continue to rigorously pursue into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to mention the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Implementing the Technology Investment Roadmap) Regulations 2021. The chamber will recall disallowing a similar instrument on 22 June last year. In this monitor, the committee draws the Senate's attention to a third instrument made under the ARENA Act, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (General Funding Strategy) Determination 2021. Concerningly, this is yet another significant instrument that is exempt from disallowance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has the same concerns in relation to all three ARENA instruments, noting all three are made under the ARENA Act, the object of which is to improve the competitiveness and supply of renewable energy in Australia. The committee is recommending that the Senate disallow the Technology Investment Roadmap regulations for two primary reasons. First, on the basis that they may be expanding the remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency beyond the power of its enabling legislation. Secondly, we are concerned that the regulations deal with the significant matter of expanding the jurisdiction of ARENA from investing in renewable energy technologies to programs relating to energy efficiency and low-emissions technology. It is therefore the committee's strong view that the measures set out in the regulations are more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I would like to briefly update the Senate on the committee's consideration of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Amendment (2021 Measures No. 3) Regulations 2021. The committee is very cognisant of the concerns that have been raised in relation to this, including with the committee directly. I expect many colleagues also share these concerns. The instrument amends the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Regulation 2013 to alter certain governance standards relating to charities' engagement in or promotion of unlawful activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's most significant outstanding scrutiny concerns centre on a provision of the instrument which requires charities to maintain reasonable internal control procedures to ensure that its resources are neither used, nor continue to be used, to actively promote another entity's unlawful acts or omissions. The committee is concerned that this provision appears to enable the ACNC commissioner to exercise a broad discretion in determining compliance with the governance standards. In addition, the lack of clarity on what will constitute reasonable internal control procedures may inhibit charities' ability to understand their obligations under the instrument. Due to these substantive scrutiny concerns, the committee is recommending that the Senate disallow the instrument. With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated legislation monitor: Monitor 15 of 2021</span> to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I would like to say a few words in support of the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation; I am the deputy chair of the committee. This is a committee with a long history in this place. Throughout its 90 years of work, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation has played an essential role in ensuring that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of executive-made laws. It's a role that all of us in this chamber have a constitutional obligation to undertake. We are, of course, to quote <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>, a 'house of review and reflection'. It is in this tradition that this committee has conducted its work on a bipartisan basis, with a focus on holding the executive's exercise of lawmaking powers to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its 90-year history, the committee has never taken the unprecedented action that we are seeing before the Senate today, in concurrence with a statement that's been made by the deputy chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills about matters rising from the Biosecurity Act 2015. Senator Dean Smith, as the acting chair of that committee, had a statement to the chamber incorporated into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> shortly before these remarks. Parliament's role in overseeing the delegated legislation made in response to COVID-19 has unquestionably been constrained since the beginning of the pandemic. The powers of the Biosecurity Act have been the government's main legislative vehicle, and this has allowed the minister for health to make a human biosecurity emergency declaration, with its provisions to take effect despite any other law.</span>

                    </a>  This, as I say, has allowed the minister for health to change any other piece of legislation within this Commonwealth. The minister is seeking now to extend the powers of the human biosecurity emergency declaration for a sixth time, notionally ending on 17 December 2021. I don't think we know if that is the last time that he will be seeking that. If it isn't, there's nothing this chamber can do about that, given that these instruments are not disallowable. The committee has previously raised significant concerns about the exemption from disallowance of legislative instruments made under the Biosecurity Act. The committee has suggested:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… amendments should be moved to the Biosecurity Amendment (Enhanced Risk Management) Bill 2021 to amend section 476 of the Biosecurity Act to provide that any future variations to extend a human biosecurity emergency period will be subject to disallowance—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, subject to this chamber or the House of Representatives actually being able to address that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In correspondence with the committee, the minister replied that he thought there had been extensive and robust debate through both houses of parliament when the bill was introduced in 2015 and that therefore the possibility of disallowance was not necessary. That bill, as debated in 2015, was essentially about fauna and flora, not about pandemics. Neither the bill nor the explanatory memorandum even mentioned the word 'pandemic', so it's hardly received the extensive debate that the minister contended. The House of Representatives and the Senate both spent about five hours considering that bill, a bill which has fundamentally changed the regulatory regime in this country and had the effect of changing the way in which the states and territories have dealt with that issue, right across the Commonwealth. With only minor amendments, the bill passed both houses of parliament on 14 May 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Smith has pointed out in the chamber in a tabled statement, we're seeing more and more examples of coercive powers being bestowed upon a minister without parliamentary oversight. These include provisions where individuals are required to take medical examinations and provide body samples through that coercive power. Time and time again, in the correspondence from ministers, this action is taken in the name of so-called administrative flexibility. The committee has been told that it's being subject to disallowance would only undermine the government's ability to respond to emergency threats. The committee acknowledges there are genuine emergencies and that there should be exemptions in specific cases, but there should not a blanket principle of exemption or disallowance in all circumstances, which is the way in which this position is being put so often in the correspondence from ministerial officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate that we are seeing a contemptuous tone grow from the executive about the concerns that this committee and its sister committee have raised. For the first time in its history, the committee took the unprecedented step in 2020 of holding public hearings into the exemption of delegated legislation from parliamentary oversight, making 11 recommendations that, as the chair of the committee has already indicated, have not yet been responded to by the government. I note that the committee has moved a motion tonight to gain a commitment from the executive, and I'm advised by other members of the government that the government will respond. I look forward to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament and the public should be able to rely upon proper public administration, but it should also be able to rely upon proper parliamentary scrutiny of that legislation. At the start of the pandemic, when a human biosecurity emergency was declared, the committee chose to facilitate public scrutiny of COVID-19-related delegated legislation. A table on the committee's website lists all the delegated legislation registered on the Federal Register of Legislation since 18 March 2020. As of 15 October 2021, 578 legislative instruments had been made in response to COVID-19. The committee has long stressed its concern about the growth of disallowable instruments and, of course, the issue of the way in which the executive is ruling by decree as a result of this fundamental change in the way in which legislation is moved through this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March, the committee's inquiry reported that the volume of delegated legislation made each year had increased over time. From an average in the mid-1980s of around 850 disallowable instruments tabled each year, it currently sits at around 1,500 each year. This is not a trend we should be proud of, particularly when we consider the number of these instruments which cannot in any way be overturned through the processes of the parliament. That, to me, is a matter of deep concern. Senators, if we do not do our duty and take up our responsibilities to correct this dangerous state of affairs, we may rightly and properly be accused of negligence, and so we should be. I commend the report to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia cooperates closely with likeminded partners in the Pacific, in consultation with Pacific nations. Defence regularly participates in bilateral and multilateral exercises, such as exercises Croix du Sub, Marara (France-led) and Southern Katipo (New Zealand-led) and operations with likeminded and Pacific security forces through Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA)-led operations such as Kuru Kuru, Island Chief and Tui Moana.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that maritime security and domain awareness is incredibly important to the Pacific, many of whom are responsible for vast exclusive economic zones. Defence recognises this through the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which is gifting 21 Guardian-class patrol boats to the Pacific and Timor-Leste. This program, succeeding the Pacific Patrol Boat Program, represents more than six decades of sustained maritime security engagement and underscores our commitment to the region.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, Defence works closely with Pacific nations and regional security organisations such as the FFA to ensure that Defence's maritime surveillance contributions are coordinated, demand-driven and respectful of Pacific sovereignty. For example, Defence contributes to maritime information gathering and sharing through Operation Solania, which is the ADF's contribution to FFA-led counter-illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing operations and the Pacific Maritime Security Program's aerial surveillance contract through FFA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the responsibility for HADR lies with civilian agencies in the affected or responding nations, militaries are often called on to contribute and HADR is a feature of our defence cooperation. Defence regularly works with partners at a time of crisis to deliver logistical and engineering support, distributing humanitarian supplies, provide aerial surveillance, undertake damage assessment and conduct search, rescue and recovery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2020 Defence Gender, Peace and Security Mandate commits Defence to integrating gender, peace and security principles across the breadth and complexity of Defence international engagement. Defence is also an implementing Department under Australia's second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2021-2031 launched by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs/Women, Defence and Home Affairs on 12 April 2021. Outcome 3 of the second NAP undertakes to 'support resilience, crisis and security, law and justice efforts to meet the needs and rights of all women and girls'. In meeting these commitments, Defence has included a gender advisor on HADR operations in the Pacific. We will continue to consider the different needs of women, men, boys and girls throughout preparedness planning and the conduct of emergency assistance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 has affected how Defence delivers HADR. Defence has adapted by developing COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures to ensure the ADF can deliver HADR and other support in a safe manner. These were tested in Australia's response to Tropical Cyclone Yasa in December 2020. At Fiji's request, the ADF partnered with the Republic of Fiji Military Force (RFMF) to deliver humanitarian supplies, clear debris, generate clean drinking water and repair damaged schools.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has benefited from the growing HADR capabilities of Pacific militaries. In 2020, 54 RFMF, 100 PNG Defence Force and 116 New Zealand Defence Force personnel deployed to support Australia's bushfire crisis response. This was the first time Pacific military personnel deployed to support an Australian disaster. This, and the RFMF's support to Australia's flood response in early 2021, exemplifies the mutual trust and respect that underpins our defence partnerships and demonstrated the invaluable role Pacific militaries can perform in response to a crisis. The Australian Government again thanks Fiji, PNG and New Zealand for their support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the tabling of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia's final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A way forward</span>. I wish to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land I'm on and the traditional owners all over the country. I pay my respects to elders past and present and to the continued practice of caring for country and culture.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a significant inquiry that shone a light on the many ways in which First Nations cultural heritage is destroyed in this country. Sometimes this destruction is even encouraged. While Juukan Gorge was a wake-up call for many Australians, the wilful and legal destruction of cultural heritage is not new for First Nations people. As the final report clearly shows, First Nations people across Western Australia have been experiencing the impact of inadequate legislation for decades. Commonwealth and state governments are prioritising the interests of mining companies over the protection of cultural heritage, and gag clauses have been used for decades to prevent First Nations people from speaking out on activities that are happening on country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see the committee recommend that the gag clauses and clauses restricting First Nations people's access to Commonwealth heritage protections should be prohibited. The committee has made important recommendations that, if enacted, have the power to change the way we protect and preserve tangible and intangible heritage. The committee recommends the implementation of a new Commonwealth legislative framework for cultural heritage protection at a national level, developed through a process co-designed with First Nations people. As my colleague Senator Thorpe noted, it's important that this entire process be First Nations led. The committee also recommends that this new legislation set out minimum standards for state and territory heritage protections, consistent with relevant international law, including the international Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and <span style="font-style:italic;">Dhawura Ngilan: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eritage in Australia</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight what's going on in my home state, Western Australia, to demonstrate why a national framework for cultural heritage protection is so important. As outlined in the final report, the main legal framework for cultural heritage in WA is currently the Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972 of WA. This is completely inadequate. This act enables the legal destruction of cultural heritage and does not respect the right of self-determination or free, prior and informed consent. It serves the interests of mining companies, not of the community. There is strong agreement that new legislation and regulations are needed to replace the current act, with the WA government embarking on a reform process over the past 18 months. However, the draft legislation that has been presented to the community is not strong enough to prevent the destruction that occurred at Juukan Gorge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Claims of consultation have been nothing more than one-way stakeholder engagement, frustrating many First Nations people to the point that they walked out. The WA Cultural Heritage Alliance, which has representation of cultural owners from across the state, have met with the minister but have been told that the consultation period is now closed and no further comments on the draft will be accepted. Community hasn't even seen the final draft of this bill and are afraid that it will be introduced and rushed through by a majority Labor government without the voices of First Nations people being heard. This is simply unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft bill does not meet best-practice international standards. It is incompatible with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and does not meet the minimum standards set out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The core problem with this bill is that it fails to recognise First Nations people as the primary decision-makers in the protection of their cultural heritage. There are strong concerns that the bill will make it worse and actually take us backwards. In part, this is because the bill gives proponents the power to decide on what constitutes First Nations cultural heritage and to make critical judgements about whether their proposed activities will actually destroy heritage. Proponents should not be making decisions about cultural heritage. This does not meet the principle of free, prior and informed consent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft bill will also give the minister the final say over the destruction of First Nations cultural heritage, and it does not include an appeals process. Any decision-making can be overturned by the minister in the social and economic interests of the state. This enables the minister to authorise the destruction of cultural heritage and this risks replicating the process we have had with section 18C all over again. All decision-making around cultural heritage must rest with the traditional owners, not mining companies or the minister. In my home state, section 18C has become a damage-by-permit system which actually facilitates the capacity of mining companies to legally destroy First Nations cultural heritage.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all Australians. Protecting the community from terrorist threats is one of the Government's highest priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a robust national security and counter-terrorism framework to ensure that our agencies have the powers they need to prevent terrorist attacks and manage those who would seek to commit them. Since the National Terror Threat Level was raised to 'Probable' in 2014, the Australian Government has passed 19 tranches of national security legislation to ensure agencies have the powers they need to prevent terrorist attacks. These laws are kept under constant review to ensure that our legal frameworks are appropriate and adapted to the evolving threat environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016, the Australian Government introduced the High Risk Terrorist Offender regime into the Commonwealth Criminal Code. This provides for the continuing detention of high risk terrorist offenders who pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorism offence at the end of their custodial sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2020 is the latest step of this Government, in partnership with States and Territories, to safeguard Australians from the threat of terrorism. The Bill will establish an extended supervision order scheme to ensure that high risk terrorist offenders who are released into the community at the end of their custodial sentences are subject to close supervision in proportion to the level of risk they pose to community safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we have learnt from the appalling 2019 London Bridge and 2020 Streatham attacks in the UK, convicted terrorist offenders can pose a very real threat to the community at the conclusion of their sentence. With several convicted terrorist offenders due to complete their custodial sentences of imprisonment in the next five years, the need for effective risk management measures to keep our community safe is greater than ever. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill seeks to broaden the range of tools available to address the risk posed by convicted terrorist offenders. The threshold for a Supreme Court to order continuing detention is high, commensurate with the severity of continuing detention. Extended supervision orders will allow Supreme Courts to impose tailored supervisory conditions specific to the risk posed by the terrorist offender if released into the community, where the Court is not satisfied that continuing detention is appropriate to prevent that risk. While control orders are available, they can only be made by Federal Courts and provide for a smaller range of possible conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under an extended supervision order, a Supreme Court may impose any conditions (which includes prohibitions, restrictions or obligations) that it is satisfied are reasonably necessary, and reasonably appropriate and adapted, for the purpose of protecting the community from the unacceptable risk of the offender committing a serious terrorism offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of a Commonwealth scheme for extended supervision orders responds to recommendations of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the Criminal Code to make extended supervision orders available for eligible terrorist offenders.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where the Minister for Home Affairs seeks a continuing detention order, and the Court is not satisfied of the thresholds for this order, the Bill will require the Court to consider an extended supervision order as an alternative. The Minister may also apply to a State or Territory Supreme Court for an extended supervision order if the Minister considers this appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extended supervision order scheme has been designed to allow the Court to tailor orders to address the particular risk posed by each terrorist offender. The offender must comply with the conditions set by the Court, and offences will apply to breaches of those conditions. The maximum duration of an extended supervision order is three years, but subsequent orders may be made if the offender continues to pose an unacceptable risk to the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Courts may appoint relevant experts, such as psychologists or psychiatrists, to assist the court to assess the risk posed by the offender. An extended supervision order must be reviewed annually by a court, or sooner if the offender or Minister for Home Affairs applies for a review. The Court must vary the order if the court is not satisfied that the period of the order, or the conditions imposed by the order, remain reasonably necessary to protect the community from the unacceptable risk posed by the offender. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also includes provisions to support the operation of the scheme, relating to information sharing arrangements, the ability for the Minister to direct an offender to undergo an assessment by a relevant expert, and the ability for the AFP Commissioner to enter into arrangements for the performance of functions related to the scheme (for example, electronic monitoring). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004</span> to extend existing provisions which apply to control order proceedings, to allow the Court to consider sensitive information in extended supervision order proceedings without that information being disclosed to the offender or their legal representative. This will ensure that the process of applying for an extended supervision order does not reveal sensitive sources, which is of utmost importance in a custodial environment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that the offender receives a fair hearing, the Bill extends the existing special advocate regime which is currently in place for control order proceedings.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is facing increasing cyber security threats to essential services, businesses and all levels of government.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While owners and operators of critical infrastructure are best placed to deal with such threats, it takes a team effort to bring about positive change. That is why the ongoing security and resilience of critical infrastructure must be a shared responsibility – by all governments and the owners and operators of the infrastructure. The cost of inaction is far too great to ignore. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Part 2A of the Bill requires entities to adopt and comply with a risk management program that ensures critical infrastructure assets are protected and safeguarded from all-hazards.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through greater awareness, the Government can better see malicious trends and campaigns which would not be apparent to an individual victim of an attack.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also facilitates the Government to work with industry to strengthen the cyber preparedness and resilience of entities that operate assets of the highest criticality to Australia's national interests. These assets of highest criticality are defined as systems of national significance due to the role they serve in the economy and the consequences to the national interest should they be unavailable or inoperable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rate of people living in poverty in Australia is appalling. It's particularly appalling because we've seen so recently that it can be different. In 2020 we saw payment rates lifted above the poverty line for the first time in years.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all things that the rest of us who aren't living in poverty take for granted. This government has made a choice. After seeing the demonstrable difference that raising the rate of income support made to people's lives, the government chose to once again slash the level of income support and force people back into poverty. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to share the story of Melissa, who is one of the people forced to live on a payment below the poverty line: 'About six months after being put on JobSeeker, I made a suicide attempt. When I was asked why I'd done this, my only response at the time was, "Because I can't afford to live." The worst part after losing Mum was going onto JobSeeker, because I was thrown into even more poverty. It felt like everything was falling down beside me, and all of a sudden I didn't have the money to support me. We are not bludgers. There are real barriers to working, and we are just doing the best we can to survive.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I emailed a lot of people who previously had been supporting our Greens campaigns and supporting the fantastic work that former senator Rachel Siewert did, over the last six years, on poverty and on raising the rate. I emailed them during the week, introducing myself as the Greens' new spokesperson for community affairs and asked them to share their stories with me about what it would mean to them if JobSeeker were doubled, what it would mean to them to be no longer living in poverty, and what their experience of living in poverty while living on JobSeeker currently was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had many people get back to me immediately. Some of the things they told me were that they often had to choose whether to buy food or medication or whether to keep the lights or heat on. Someone said, 'I had to stop medications I should be taking because I cannot afford them. My consumption of food has been reduced by so much in the last eight months that I have lost 30 kilograms.' Someone else said: 'I've managed to keep a roof over my head, but at the expense of everything else. This has affected my mental health, and I now spend most of my time in the house unable to go out.' Another person: 'I have a car I can't afford to run, so basically I am in this house 24 hours a day.' Someone else: 'I'm a diabetic, so lack of food causes my sugars to go down often, resulting in coma-like episodes.' 'I can't afford physio,' said another person, 'I can't afford medication all the time. When JobSeeker payments were increased last year, I could afford to pay my bills and not worry so much about having to work in pain in work that I'm no longer suited to.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have what happens to people who through no fault of their own find themselves not being able to work. This person said, after they had been living on JobSeeker for the last year: 'Since then, my savings, which are mostly made up of super money I withdrew, have gone down at a rapid rate. I've had to take out around $1,000 a month to get by. My employment provider has done nothing, literally. They refused to help with PPE, uniforms, self-education expenses. So with Indue making around 12k a year from me,' because they're on the cashless debit card, 'and the DSS provider getting around $400 once a fortnight from me for having to visit them, they are getting the exact same amount I receive in payments for these companies. The rate of JobSeeker payment is designed to punish people and to force them to work for bad employers who should not be in business.' One other person said, 'Being on JobSeeker feels like a punishment, a punishment for not being able to find work when there simply aren't enough jobs to go around. You see people around you enjoying the most basic things, like catching up with friends for a coffee, and you feel like you've been kicked when you're already down. It's a punishment, and it's killing people.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's particularly appalling when you hear these heartbreaking stories is that in the midst of the COVID pandemic the major corporations were raking in the funding hand over fist. They were making out like bandits. Costings by the Parliamentary Budget Office estimate that if just 65 corporations who paid executive bonuses or made excessive profits returned the JobKeeper funds that they got it would involve returning over $1 billion. But JobKeeper isn't the only program that corporations made very well out of. The last budget set out $11.4 billion in subsidies to keep burning fossil fuels and $1.4 billion for new coal and gas projects. So this government can afford to pay subsidies for the biggest polluters in a climate crisis but says it cannot afford to rescue people from the whirlpool of poverty that they are trapped in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are so many other forms of support for corporations and the ultra rich. Research commissioned by Anglicare estimated that the cost of tax concessions for the wealthiest 20 per cent in our community amounted to $68 billion every year. That research was several years ago, and I feel confident that the number hasn't gone down. But while the government is making the choice to reward billionaires and big corporations, it is also making another choice to force people into poverty, to force people to live on a payment whose rate is below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to share some accounts of people who have faced Centrelink debts. Earlier today, in answer to my question in question time, the Minister for Families and Social Services told me that, no, they weren't going to be going after corporations who'd made profits out of JobKeeper and then said that the people who had inadvertently received both JobSeeker and JobKeeper had potentially committed fraud and, yes, they were going to go after them, because they'd committed fraud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share the voices that this government has made the choice to punish. This is what one person had to say to me: 'I was initially told that I didn't qualify for JobKeeper, along with 120 other casual employees. As it turns out, I did. In the meantime, I got JobSeeker. When JobKeeper came through I was back paid and rang Centrelink to let them know. In that conversation I explained the details of having to fight for JobKeeper. They informed me that they could not collect debt at that time by law and that I'd be asked to return overpayments when they were able to collect again. Even voluntary payment wasn't allowed. Many months later I get an incredibly rude phone call—'You didn't declare for JobKeeper for date X to date Y—and I had to go through the entire thing again, stating it clearly all on the record. I had written down dates and amounts approximately six months earlier and said I needed to find all that paperwork because the phone call was out of the blue. The amount they wanted returned was well over what I had recorded, and I went through it with a fine-tooth comb. It was two fortnights only, but they were attempting to get three. This did eventually get sorted and I paid the correct amount. But I'm in Melbourne, where we have spent around 43 per cent of our lives in lockdown since 30 March 2020. I have a casual job in retail. They dock my pay per fortnight that I get to work but don't account for the times I'm legally not allowed to. I'm earning well under the annual amount for pay docking. No system has been introduced to help us or to account for this. They are very quick to take our earnings but ignore completely when they owe us.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how our government treats some of the most vulnerable people in our society, the poorest people, people who are really living on the edge. There are stories after stories of people living in poverty. It's a choice. It's a political choice. We could lift people out of poverty. It is possible. It's a political choice. We could raise the rate, like we did last year when people suddenly discovered that they could live life again, suddenly discovered that they could get by, suddenly discovered that they actually had enough money to eat well, to be able to get themselves to jobs and to be able to feed their kids. This is a political choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are calling for our income support rate to be lifted above the poverty line. It's the least we can do in the rich country that we live in. It is the least we can do. The response from this government—'That's going to discourage people from getting work'—is just such a furphy. The jobs aren't there. It's really just labelling people as dole bludgers when, in fact, we have people who are doing everything they can to keep their heads above water. It is the least we can be doing to be looking after people in our society. We are a wealthy country. We can afford to be doubling our income support rate, to be lifting people out of poverty, to be giving everybody the opportunity to be living meaningful and fulfilling lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  It's just groundhog day—here we are again! I know Senator Siewert's left and so someone else has got to start to make their mark, but this is just getting beyond a joke. I know that the Greens love to share stories, so I thought I'd start with a couple of stories of my own. I'm going to talk about John down in Jervis Bay who owns a hotel. He called me as he was making the beds because he cannot get staff. One of the reasons we couldn't get staff in rural and regional areas when we had the additional JobSeeker supplement being paid was that it was actually more beneficial for people to go lie on the beach than work. So all of these businesses that were requiring staff could not get them because people were earning more money, or a pretty good rate, not having to work and not having to participate in the economy or in the community in any meaningful way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are friends of mine up in Moree. I know I was referred to today, I think by Senator McAllister, as the 'senator for Sydney'. That's a little bit offensive after the decade and a half I spent in Moree. They cannot get a worker in as they prep the cotton gins for a boom harvest in cotton next year let alone where they are with the current grain harvest. If we want to talk about opportunities, there is more work available than ever before. The post-pandemic economy is absolutely booming. There are plenty of jobs at every level of skill. So we don't need to talk about the fact that some of them are highly skilled jobs. There are plenty of jobs across the board. There's plenty of opportunity for people who want to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the difference between us and those who sit at the far end of the chamber. We see our social security system as a safety net. It's something that is there for everyday Australians when they need it. It's not a living wage. It's not a substitute for participating in the economy and contributing to this country. The social security safety net that we provide is paid for by taxpayers. So we owe it to every single taxpayer to ensure that the safety net is not only sustainable, viable and accessible to everybody should they need it but also that is not a permanent stop. It's somewhere where we encourage people to do training. We offer job training, courses, resumes and advice on how to dress for an interview. All of those skills are provided because we know the best form of welfare is a job. And it's not just the cash side of it that helps. It's the community engagement. It's the interaction with workers. It's the boost to your own self-esteem and mental health. It's also a fantastic example to show your children. Too many children in this country grow up in a cycle of unemployment that leads to unemployment from generation to generation to generation. Whilst there is a JobSeeker rate, there are also substantial additional payments on top of that. They are never mentioned by the Greens at the end of the chamber. They forget about those things—rental assistance, phone assistance, family tax benefits part A and B, the pharmaceutical allowance, the healthcare card, bulk billing and medical services. All of these things are never mentioned, because they just want to talk about one rate and one rate alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to keep everybody here all night—we have had our hours extended already—but I want to read out a tweet today from a girlfriend of mine. She grew up in public housing. She tweeted: 'I managed to crawl out of that hellhole of public housing life, work and study since I was 17, buy a house, have a family, travel the world and even eat in fancy restaurants while doing interesting things for a living.' She is an absolutely outstanding example of someone who worked hard to pull herself up and contribute to this country. She has a beautiful son and a gorgeous dog, Scout, and she is contributing to this country in a very significant way. Our social security system is there as a safety net. It is there for all Australians. It is paid for by all Australians. Unlike other countries, we have no time limit. But we encourage Australians to take up the supports that we provide and to look at getting back into the workforce, because that is where they are going to be the most happy.</span>

There are so many people in this country who rely on those support payments, and all the other additional support payments that were referred to, and they also would like a job. The understanding of those on the other side of the chamber that anyone who is unemployed is just a dole bludger, is lazy, just can't be bothered is a total and utter falsehood. There are people living below the poverty line in this country and they want a hand up. They want an education. They want to be able to get a job. And I can assure you that those employment services, whose praises have been sung, are not delivering on those promises. They are not providing the support that people need. It is Anti-Poverty Week and the biggest problem we have in this country is the attitude of some people to those who are disadvantaged, to those who are unwell, to those who cannot find a job. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech"> COX</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  Anti-Poverty Week provides everyone in this chamber an opportunity to stop and reflect, and I echo Senator Grogan's comments as well. Living in poverty is actually a permanent state of lockdown for people, and we have to see that as a reality for some Australians. It has a devastating impact on your health, your mental health, your relationships, your family, your ability to thrive and have a full life. It impacts on your ability to access safe housing, good education and health services. As others have said, this is a wealthy country and no-one should be living below the poverty line. Yet we have got a government that chooses income support payments below the poverty line. We have a social security system that fails First Nations people. This is compounded by the fact that this government wilfully chooses to put in place punitive programs that hurt our mob. These include the cashless debit card and the CDP. Until recently, CDP imposed harsh penalties and onerous conditions on First Nations people, particularly those living in remote areas. CDP actually exacerbated poverty and food insecurity and even led to First Nations people disengaging from the system altogether.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While people welcomed Minister Wyatt's recent announcement that CDP would be replaced, I'm sad to say that the new program doesn't look any better. The government hasn't announced which communities the trial of the next program will take place in and how they were selected. In fact, the Coalition of Peaks and Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory only learnt about this bill when it was tabled in parliament. This doesn't embody the partnership and shared decision-making that we First Nations people have been told should happen, with governments agreeing under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. It's ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations communities, elders, leaders and organisations have long demanded that all levels of government work in true partnership to create sustainable jobs that pay a living wage in remote communities. If the government listened, they would learn about the proposals from the community and address the job situation in remote communities. For example, the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory put forward their proposal on a Fair Work Strong Communities program to address the lack of good, sustainable jobs in remote communities. Under this plan, 12,000 jobs in community controlled organisations would be created, while valuing the strength and resilience of those communities and the cultural, environmental and community care work that is done there every single day. This is what is possible when First Nations people are in the driving seat delivering those solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all aware of the devastating impacts that poverty can have on your mental health. Living in poverty means you are under constant stress. People who are trapped in the cycle of poverty often find it impossible to access long-term mental health treatments. Mental health services in Australia are out of reach for too many people who cannot afford to access them. It is not only the lack of mental health system services; it's also the inadequacy of the income support payments and the punitive approach to social security. Cutting or suspending someone's income support payment doesn't work. It hurts people in the long run and compounds their trauma and suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the Greens announced our plan to create universal, unlimited and available mental health care through Medicare, funded by taxing the billionaires and the big corporations who are making the big profits. Imagine the positive impact that would have in our communities. When everyone can access free mental health support, our whole community will benefit through an improved quality of life, improved relationships and better performance while studying or working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key solutions to addressing poverty is raising the rate of income support payments above the poverty line, which this government has failed to do. First Nations people experience poverty at a higher rate than non-Indigenous people. This is a direct result of the ongoing legacy of colonisation and intergenerational trauma. Raising the rate of income support payments above the poverty line will have a direct impact in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate inquiry into the adequacy of Newstart, NAAJA provided evidence from a client who lived in the remote community of Beswick. They said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Went back to work yesterday. Finding it hard to pay my bills and housing. Finding it hard to buy food. When you're on that Newstart, it's not enough. It's making me feel hurt inside. You've got not enough to pay your bill or power, or even buy food. Just recently I got debit from my bank. When I went to take it out I only had $54 dollars. It caused me and my son to fight and argue about the money I had. When you're struggling with that Newstart allowance, it hurts inside how you're going to buy food and power. I like to share my money. Even though it's so small. I like to buy food and share with my family. It makes me sad inside when I can't do this. It makes me feel worried about what to do. It makes me feel like I want to hurt myself. It makes me stressed.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hearing that should hit you right in the chest. This amount of stress is caused because people are living below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all saw what happened last year when the government doubled the rate of JobKeeper payment. People across the country finally had enough money to put food on the table, afford essential medications and pay their rent This extra income had a huge impact on families doing it tough as a result of the pandemic. It meant they had enough to cover the basics like healthy food, warm clothes in winter and after-school activities like sport and music. Importantly, it relieved stress on parents and children, which compounds hardship, and, as a single mother, I can attest to that. Some of it was also a means to escape violence. I'm proud to be a part of the only party in this place that has consistently called for an increase in income support payments.</span>

                  </a>  Earlier today Senator Sheldon compared my views on industrial relations to the callous cruelty displayed on the popular Netflix show <span style="font-style:italic;">Squid </span><span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ame</span>, but in doing so he's misled this chamber, falsely claiming that I had called particular Qantas staff 'inflexible and unreasonable'. Referring to the take note debate in December last year, Senator Sheldon claimed I had accused 2,000 Qantas workers whose jobs had been outsourced of being 'inflexible and unreasonable'. He claimed I supported forcing workers into work arrangements or rates of pay regardless of how unfair they may be with those who resisted to be turfed out onto the street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it's not obvious from its absurdity, this could not be any further from the truth. My only statement about the Qantas workers who had tragically lost their jobs was to say that it was a disaster. I explained that this was why the Morrison government had put so much effort and so much of the public's resources into trying to keep businesses afloat during COVID so they could keep on their staff. And, far from forcing people into the situations Senator Sheldon described, I was arguing in favour of a healthy and vibrant economy so we have fewer vulnerable people in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I used the terms 'inflexible and unreasonable' to describe something in my take note contribution, it was to describe the approach of Senator Sheldon and his Labor colleagues to industrial relations, not to the 2,000 Qantas workers. I described how rigid and inflexible workplace relations laws risk making it harder for businesses to employ people, depriving them of the dignity of work.</span>
