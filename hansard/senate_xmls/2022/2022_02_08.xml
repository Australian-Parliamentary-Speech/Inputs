We have continued to extend remote participation as border controls and other restrictions have existed around the country, but it is the wish of the government and I believe of other parties to ensure that remote participation is not a permanent feature of this place. No senator should automatically assume that it will be extended for other sittings, and we will continue to monitor carefully the COVID situation around the country and work cooperatively across the chamber to ensure that participation is available to senators but also that the appropriate place for Senate participation, being here in this chamber, is the paramount consideration in the long term.

However, we don't see remote participation as a permanent feature of the Senate and it should remain under review each sitting period. Our view is that people, if they are able to, should attend the Senate in person. It has served a purpose during these unprecedented times, but it is time limited, and senators should be aware that that is certainly the thinking of the opposition on this matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I felt that I had no option but to leave that building, and it wasn't because I didn't like working in politics, it wasn't because I didn't enjoy staffing, but that office made it untenable for me to be in the vicinity of that building. And to even show up I was getting severe chest pain walking into the building.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That individual's loss, reflective of that of others who contributed to Commissioner Jenkins's work, is our nation's loss. The fact that we lose good people is a loss in each of our offices and a loss to the parliament as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement of acknowledgement delivered by you, Mr President, and by the Speaker today was the first recommendation of Commissioner Jenkins's report. Her report, as you acknowledged, was received in the final sitting week of 2021. And today, the first sitting day of 2022, we take the action of delivering upon that first important recommendation of acknowledging the harms that have been caused by saying, sincerely, sorry for those harms and apologising for the circumstances and culture that led to them and for the failures in systems in terms of the way in which they have been handled over time. We commit ourselves to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Commissioner Jenkins for the enormous amount of work she did to ensure that the voices of current and former staff and of current and former parliamentarians could be heard through her review. I thank her for her guidance and feedback, not just in that report but through the process and the undertaking of that report and, subsequently, in the actions in implementing the report, including the drafting of your statement and the work around the procedures for it to occur today. This review and this statement would not have been possible—indeed, would not have occurred—without those current and former staff who were willing to share their stories and their experiences. I acknowledge all of them. Most of them, the vast majority, are unknown publicly—as they would wish, in terms of respecting their privacy. But I acknowledge those who have spoken out publicly as well. Those such as Ms Brittany Higgins, who has shown bravery in sharing her experience and who has also continued to engage constructively with Commissioner Jenkins; with Ms Stephanie Foster, who undertook the interim report and review last year for shorter-term responses the parliament could take; and with Ms Kerri Hartland, the chair of the leadership task force recommended by the Jenkins review to oversee the implementation of the recommendations. They all—both publicly known and named and those participating, advising and making their views known and experiences known in private—have played a role in bringing us to this point today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Life is a journey of learning, of understanding, of growing. Each of us learns in different ways right throughout our lives. One of the great privileges of the jobs that those of us in this place have, serving as members of parliament, is the ability to learn from the diverse experiences of so many others right around the country as we engage in our jobs and seek to represent those who put us here. The events of the last year have been a period of learning for me, and I hope they have been for all others, as I have reflected upon the experiences that've been told—stories and experiences of my own office and those across the rest of the parliament—and thought about how we can do better and how we can change culture one step at a time through the actions of each and every one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's statement is an important step forward. It builds on some steps that we as a parliament have already begun, including through our unanimous resolutions in this chamber and in the other place in support of the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service—established last year—and its independent complaints mechanism. It builds upon the steps that overwhelmingly we have all taken in undertaking the professional training that is in place, as well as the steps that have been taken through the provision of trauma-informed counselling across this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement of acknowledgement rightly identifies that those steps are not enough, that we commit to delivering upon the recommendations and acting upon the recommendations of the Jenkins review to make our Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces safe and respectful for everyone. These recommendations call upon all of us in parliamentary workplaces to show leadership. They are not a matter for any one party. I thank the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents for their cooperation and support from the early commissioning of the Jenkins review, the legal protections that were put in place for participants in that review, the conclusion and handling of the release of it, and, more recently, the establishment of a leadership task force and the initial steps towards implementing its recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we implement those recommendations there will be legislation introduced into this parliament this week. There will be a motion to put in place other procedures to implement recommendations this week and there is much more work occurring in the background to deliver upon the other recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the same spirit of cooperation and support across the chamber and the parliament in delivering upon all of those different aspects of this report. The cross-parliamentary approach has been a hallmark of what we have done to date and, as Commissioner Jenkins has said, will be vital for us to continue into the future. We owe our staff of today; the staff, members and senators who served here previously; and, perhaps most importantly, those who will come in the future, nothing less than to continue that cooperative, thoughtful approach to implementation of these recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues through the cross-parliamentary leadership task force and the ongoing work that we have to do to ensure that we do uphold the highest standards in all Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces—that we do, as Commissioner Jenkins's report is entitled, 'set the standard' appropriately for the nation. I thank the Senate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  by leave—Mr President, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I thank you for your statement of acknowledgement today. The last passage in particular struck a poignant chord. While we know we cannot undo the harm that has already been done, we are committed to acknowledging the mistakes of the past and continuing to build safe and respectful workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The President is correct: we cannot undo the harm. For all the words in the Jenkins review and all the speeches that will be given here today, nothing we can say will undo the harm that countless staff have experienced in this workplace, and that is simply because we are too late. Too many people have been harmed. Bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault have all been able to occur—in some cases fester—in this workplace. Like many senators here today, I have sat opposite too many people as they have described to me the harms that they have endured in this building. As they have cried, we have cried. As they have expressed their anger, we have felt that anger. As they have grieved, we have grieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have grieved for their harm, but I have also grieved for the harm that has taken place while they've worked here in Parliament House, a workplace that should represent a highlight in any career. Parliament House, our workplace, should act as a model for others and be something that all Australians look to with pride. It's a place that should attract the best talent from across the country and indeed the globe, with people jostling to work with their elected representatives to build a better Australia. But too often, as the Jenkins review has shown, we've let our staff down. For that, to all our staff, past and present, we say sorry. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party in this place, I say sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, in my conversations—as, I'm sure, in many of the conversations others in this chamber have had—too many victims have questioned their own actions. They have asked: 'What did I do wrong that caused this? If I'd done things differently, could I have avoided this harm?' Of course the answer is that they did nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong with expecting your workplace to be safe. There is nothing wrong with expecting your workplace to be free of sexual harassment and the crime of sexual assault. There's nothing wrong with expecting your workplace to be deliberately fostering a positive, respectful culture where you can feel safe at work, and yet this workplace, Parliament House, has not lived up to these basic standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A culture has developed here, over the decades, where too often bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault have not been confronted. Indeed, in some cases they have been deliberately ignored or covered up. Is this behaviour occurring everywhere in this workplace? No. But could this behaviour occur anywhere in this workplace? To that question, regrettably, we all must answer yes. That is why we are here today—to both acknowledge the harm which we cannot undo and to embark on a fearless trajectory to help build a workplace where the expected standards of behaviour are modelled, championed and enforced, a workplace where respectful behaviour is rewarded and in which any Australian, no matter their gender, race, sexual orientation, disability status or age, feels safe and welcome to contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who bravely stepped into the media spotlight this past year to say enough is enough and to call for change: we are all in your debt. Without the courage of Brittany Higgins and others, the Jenkins review might never have happened. Without the Jenkins review, the hundreds of staff who contributed to the review might never have had the chance to have their voices heard. To every staff member, both current and former, who contributed to the Jenkins review, we say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these speeches will finish today, the real work for us is just beginning. The Jenkins review lays out the challenge before us and the road map for change. Maps are not always perfect; course corrections are sometimes needed. But what we must not change is our commitment to building a better workplace. Australians will be watching what happens here, as will our staff, as the Jenkins review is implemented. Australians, rightly, will not accept another generation of parliamentary staff being harmed because of our inaction. The challenge is ours, and it is a challenge I am sure this chamber can unite around.</span>

On behalf of the National Party, I have a brief contribution to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the report and we have a pathway to change. Today, we honour the incredible bravery and strength of character it's taken by all of those who have spoken up and told their stories. To each of you, I'd like to say, we hear you and we stand with you. What has occurred here over the years hasn't been acceptable. It's not who we strive to be as a collective and as individuals, and it's not who we should be. We should be a workplace—an exemplary workplace—where our best and our brightest, irrespective of their political views in a liberal democracy such as ours, seek to compete to work in and for our nation to make it a better place. Sadly, not just in recent times but over a long period of time, this hasn't been the case. We want every person to feel safe and secure, no matter where they live, work or operate in this country, and sexual harassment and assault is never okay anywhere, anytime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report highlights both cultural and structural issues with this workplace. In a bipartisan way we will work towards addressing those together, because this isn't an issue of one side of politics or the other—one chamber or another; one office or another—this is a shared problem over a long period of time, and that joint acknowledgement by our generation of parliamentarians is the real breakthrough. Many of the people who are now MPs were staff 20 or 30 years ago—I'm not one—and have seen this particular workplace evolve and change over time. But one thing hasn't. I'm very proud to be part of a government that's taken a step but also a member of a generation of parliamentarians who will work together to see the cultural and structural change that this workplace needs to deliver, and we need to be united in this commitment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key recommendations of the Jenkins report is for our parliament to reflect and think about what those appropriate changes need to be. To paraphrase one of the greatest minds—a brilliant scientist but also a woman—Marie Curie: 'We all share a responsibility for all of humanity, and progress is never swift or easy,' and anyone who thinks it is or that it will be solved by an apology or one report is kidding themselves. Today will be remembered as the hallmark of a new way of reflecting on who we are and what we stand for and where we want to be as a united nation and people—our unity reflected in a respectful workplace, in our national capital, reflecting the diversity of Australian political views as well but united that sexual harassment and assault is never okay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for the brave men and women, former staff, current staff, MPs, who fed into this report. I also want to acknowledge that many of these people still work in this building and, for this process, it has been a difficult time. Everybody has their own story. Everybody knows someone—a sister, a mother, a child, a friend, a work colleague—who has a very personal story to tell in this space. That is why this spark around the March 4 Justice last year was so powerful and why I was very proud, with other National Party MPs and senators, to join those people on our forecourt. I might not have agreed with all the political messages that were being espoused on that day but absolutely stood in solidarity with the principle that sexual assault and harassment is never okay. I want to ensure that we understand and acknowledge that for many people, when we stand up and talk about this stuff, it does trigger reflections for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the review and thank the commissioner for the exceptional work that has gone into the report. We will continue to implement all the recommendations as outlined. We are all privileged to serve. We will be the generation that takes this responsibility very seriously. The Nationals are committed to not just talking about change but ensuring, both as individual MPs and as a collective, that we work towards that end.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around half the staff in parliamentary workplaces have experienced harassment, bullying or assault during their time here—almost half. We should all be appalled by that. For First Nations people, people of colour, people with disability, the harassment and disrespect are even worse. The commission heard that even raising issues of racism or the intersectionality of racism and sexism could provoke an aggressive response. My own Greens colleagues have experienced that, as have our staff. Sexism and racism are alive and well in this parliament, and in combination they are even more damaging and dangerous. This has not been a safe workplace; this has been an entitled boys' club. As the thousands of women and allies who took to the streets to march for justice said: 'Enough. This has to stop.' There cannot be more blame-shifting, glossing over and waiting until later; the blame is ours, the shame is ours. On behalf of the Greens, we are, I am, so sorry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things on which people in this place do not agree, but on this issue we must be better and we must act collectively.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been nearly 12 months since Brittany Higgins bravely shared her experience, peeling back the curtains on the callous disregard that so many women and people have endured for so long. Hers was not the first story. Rachelle Miller, Chelsea Potter and countless others have spoken out before. Brittany Higgins' story was not even the most recent story but hers was the final straw, and this parliament must commit to making it the last story like that that someone has to tell. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brittany Higgins, Rachelle Miller, Chelsea Potter, Josie Coles, Emma Husar, Julia Banks and so many others who shared their stories with Commissioner Kate Jenkins did so because they felt they had to in order to reveal the toxic culture, the sexism, the bullying, the lack of support, the he-said, she-said mentality and the cover-ups. They did this in the hope that something would change. They chose to speak up for themselves but also for those who weren't able to speak up. We know from the report that the vast majority of staff who have been harassed in this place have made no formal report because they had no faith that anything would be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard and we have listened, but we must keep listening. The Prime Minister must listen in particular to Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins tomorrow at the Press Club. We must make sure that current and former staff—affected survivors—are involved in these reforms in a meaningful way and feel supported to tell us when we're not doing enough. We must work to support those who have suffered and those who are still suffering from their experience. We must maintain a robust, independent, confidential complaints process that people can trust. We must work to put in place a code of conduct that not only sets the standard but makes sure there are consequences when those standards are not met. We need to tackle inequality, racism, classism, homophobia and lack of representation in our parliament. The culture in this place will only change when decisions are being made by people with differing views and experiences. We must work for a more diverse and inclusive parliament that better represents our community with more women, more people of colour, more people with disability, more LGBTIQ+ people and people with diverse backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Commissioner Jenkins and her team again for the incredible work that they have done in setting out what we need to do. We owe it to everyone who took part, to everyone in this place and to everyone in the country to show some leadership and get it done. I also want to acknowledge that this work needs to be done not just in this workplace but in all workplaces around the country. We must keep working to implement a positive duty on employers to ensure that every worker in every workplace is safe and respected.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  [by video link] by leave—The apologies provided by both the Prime Minister and opposition leader of this parliament are simply virtue-signalling, hollow statements. The opposition leader and wannabe Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, oversaw one of the greatest smear campaigns of a sexual harassment victim in this parliament. Rather than address the actions of the perpetrator, Mr Slipper, Mr Albanese ran defence and provided the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to further prolong, torment and victimise the victim. This, in turn, forced the victim to acquire more than $4 million worth of legal bills that he remains financially responsible for. While an act of grace was provided by Labor to pay for Mr Slipper's multimillion-dollar legal bill, the victim has been left fearful of bankruptcy with a $4 million debt. Where is the apology and act of grace to Mr Ashby?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What saddens victims of the sexual harassment that continues to occur in this parliament is the fact that most victims have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements in return for cash settlements. Victims live with the burden of knowing the perpetrators are free to carry on with their jobs, their stature and their positions without any fallout. The act of cover-up of sexual harassment by political parties is disgraceful. If they were truly remorseful for the behaviour of current and former politicians, they would release the victims from confidentiality clauses and let them speak freely of the pain and suffering their members caused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware of at least three confidential payouts made to staff of the former Speaker. These were orchestrated by senior members of both the Liberal and Labor parties. It is not the responsibility of the taxpayer to pay out victims; it should be the politician. Only then will it make them pull their heads in. Politicians should not be treated as protected species. Too many of you have blood on your hands and the standard some of you have set as parliamentarians is shameful, both to the people who work alongside you and to the greater public. It's no wonder some staffers think it's funny to film themselves masturbating on MPs' desks and sending it on to their colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take my hat off to Brittany Higgins for coming forward. Brittany Higgins' alleged rape was not committed by a member of parliament but by a work colleague. And yet it was used to a political level for point scoring—something the Labor Party went out of its way to avoid during the Slipper case. The public sees through the pathetic attempt to deal with the subject of sexual harassment within Parliament House and, while I sympathise—truly sympathise—with each of the victims, it should be the perpetrator they're seeking an apology from, not me.</span>

Bullying, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are totally unacceptable. I just note that it is senators who set the tone and who set the culture of the way in which this building is run, and that it's up to us to make sure, where there's improper behaviour, that it is dealt with decisively. In the case of a senator engaging in this sort of conduct, we need to make sure that we watch our colleagues and also that leaders of parties are strong and decisive when this behaviour occurs.</span>

Of course, culture starts at the top and that's why it is absolutely important that as members of parliament we not only look at the details of this report, read and hear the words and the pain of those who have told their stories to the commissioner, been brave enough to come forward, either privately or in the public realm, but work together to respond and do this with genuine force, passion and commitment. </span>

This is not just about the text messages; it's because the government cannot keep people safe. It is urgent, because each week 200 people are dying from COVID. For January, that's the highest in the Asia-Pacific region per head of population. </span>

We must urgently consider this matter, because the government can't keep people safe from rising inequality. Millions of people are in dangerous insecure work, underpaid, living in unaffordable housing or not having housing at all and struggling to keep their head above water.

The Prime Minister would sell out anyone to get ahead, and those texts show that those closest to him know that all too well. During the pandemic, he and this rotten government have undermined the states. They've overseen a crisis in aged care, given false confidence to people and have failed to prepare for life after lockdown. We must urgently suspend standing orders. </span>

This chaos is dangerous, and a fish rots from the head. How can anyone have confidence in this government? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must consider this urgently, because the government can barely pass legislation. It can't establish an integrity commission. It's too busy to do that one. It's too busy for the Prime Minister to watch Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins speak at the Press Club tomorrow. This government is hanging on by one vote in the House, and it doesn't have the numbers here in the Senate. It can't get real climate action past the National Party. It can't decide whether schools should be allowed to discriminate against LGBTIQ+ kids. It can't even back a wage rise for aged-care workers. All of these issues are putting people's lives at risk. This government cannot keep people safe, and that's exactly why we need to consider this motion of no confidence urgently. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last three summers, people have died because of the failures of this government. People died in climate fuelled bushfires while Mr Morrison went on holiday to Hawaii. He waved coal around in parliament, shouting, 'Don't be scared.' People died in aged-care homes while the responsible minister went to the cricket. In a crisis, in a pandemic, you need clear, honest information from trusted sources. We have been denied that from this government because, as the text messages show, it can't tell the truth. Through the government's trying to take all the credit and push off all the blame, the country has lost all confidence. This Senate chamber must urgently consider this motion because, while the country faced incredible anxiety, stress and uncertainty caused by the global pandemic, the government were more concerned about their own re-election. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Prime Minister try to appeal to antivaxxers when it suited him and then lock out sports stars—again, to try to be popular. But we remember what you've said and what you've done, Prime Minister. The people aren't stupid; the polls show that they're onto you. Women don't like being told that they're lucky not to be shot when they speak up. Aged-care residents don't like being told that they were going to die anyway. People who are worried about the climate crisis don't like seeing coal being waved about in parliament. It's not surprising that someone in the cabinet reportedly called him 'a psycho': a man who has a trophy that he awarded himself for stopping the boats full of desperate people seeking safety in Australia, a man who waves coal around in parliament, a man who stands over people to get what he wants. Only a 'horrible, horrible man' could be proud to build a political career on the abuse of honourable people. The former Premier of New South Wales was right; this is a horrible, horrible man. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, led by this Prime Minister, cares only about itself. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull knows that. The President of France knows that. Julia Banks knows that. Even Minister Joyce knows that. The Prime Minister is a bully, he's a bigot, he's a liar and he's a fraud. We must urgently consider this vote of no confidence because the people of this country have lost confidence in him and in the government he purports to lead. This government has had a go. They've failed, and now they've got to go.</span>

That will be when the Australian people make their decision about who governs and about the constitution of this parliament for the next three years, just as they did a little under three years ago when they re-elected the Morrison government. As much as the Australian Greens may wish to change the normal electoral course, the fact is it's a job for the Australian people at the election. And I know—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                  </a>  There are the Greens, calling for an early election. I heard Senator Waters earlier, proclaiming what she saw to be the election outcome, talking about the polls, predicting the election outcome, showing the same type of hubris that she did three years ago when she made exactly the same sorts of calls, exactly the same sorts of observations about the polls, only of course to be completely wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will take nothing for granted when we go to the election in a few months time, but we will welcome the opportunity to stand on our track record of keeping Australians safe and secure through some of the most uncertain times the world has faced—through the most uncertain times, arguably, that most people in this chamber at this point in time have ever lived through. We will stand on a record that sees 1.7 million more Australians in jobs—employed, with the opportunities and the dignity that come from paid work and employment. Today, there are 1.7 million more than when our government was first elected. Incredibly, there has been a recovery and surge of 1.1 million in employment and job numbers since the pandemic of COVID-19 struck and since it disrupted economies and lives in every country around the world. You get a sort of alternative view of history from those opposite—and from the Greens from time to time—who seem to pretend that COVID-19 is happening in isolation here in Australia and ignore many of the comparisons with situations around the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But here in Australia, not without challenge, not without difficulty and not without mistakes, we have nonetheless still seen lower rates of fatalities than global averages in most other comparable nations. We have achieved higher rates of vaccinations than most other comparable nations, and we have secured stronger economic outcomes than most other nations. That's a testament to the work and cooperation of all Australians. We don't stand here as a government proclaiming all of those achievements as exclusively our own. They're the work that came from the earliest decisions that were taken to close Australia's international borders, decisions that Prime Minister Morrison took—before the global pandemic had been declared by the World Health Organization, it was recognised here in Australia. And through that closure of borders we managed to keep most of the earlier, deadlier strains of COVID-19 at bay in Australia—to buy the time for vaccines to be developed and to buy the time for the rollout to occur and to give Australians the opportunity to protect and secure themselves, as they have done in record numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through that time, our economic response plans have worked. That 1.7 million additional Australians in jobs that have been secured sees one million more Australian women in work as a result. It sees some of the highest women's workforce participation rates that our country has ever seen. It sees unemployment standing at 4.2 per cent, a 13-year low in unemployment. Youth unemployment is at such lows, in part, because of the 220,000 trade apprenticeships that have been generated, operating today as a result of the economic response policies our government has put in place. Australian families and households are dealing with the challenges of COVID with the extra security of lower taxes—there are some 11½ million Australian families enjoying tax relief to the tune of $1½ billion per month in additional income into their households to secure them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose the suspension of standing orders because this parliament has real business to get on with today, rather than the stunts of the Australian Greens. The Australian people will get to have their say at an election that we will contest, and we will argue strongly in terms of our track record and in terms of our economic plans for the future, and against the type of Labor-Greens alliance that will go to the election and that will, no doubt, if they are successful, work hand in glove, and will see those opposite held to ransom by the likes of Senator Waters.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manage</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">r of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  The Labor Party will be supporting the suspension. Whilst we agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate that there are important matters before this chamber this week, the competence and capability of the government is right at the top of that list. It gives us no pleasure to say that this is a government that has given up governing, and we have no confidence in this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason it gives me no pleasure is because, by saying that, we are letting the Australian people down—the Australian people, who rely on government to help them, to give them a hand up and to fix their problems. The government have gone missing. They are so disunified: fighting each other, leaking against each other, attacking their leader, telling the truth about their leader, wanting the Australian people to know what they really think—and, while they're doing that, they're not looking after the Australian people and all the problems that the Australian people are feeling now. There are problems in aged care, where the situation is so dire, with thousands infected with COVID, hundreds dying and staff not able to perform their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the real world out there. People are worried about COVID. People are worried about their kids. People are worried about getting access to the booster. These are people's real worries: how they pay to fill their car up, how they buy their groceries, how they meet the rising cost of living. These are the problems that are out there. The Australian people deserve a government that's going to turn up every day and work on their behalf, and we haven't seen any evidence of that for months from this government. They're missing in action, and their disunity and failure to govern has real-life consequences for the Australian people. That is what angers us, and that is why we are supporting this today. We have no confidence. The Australian people are fast losing any remnant of confidence they had, waking up to stories about psychos and horrible, horrible men and liars and hypocrites and to stories about infighting. They don't want to hear about that. They want a government in place that's going to deal with the real challenges facing this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as others already have, can go through the list of failures of this government: the rorts; the waste; the billions of dollars of taxpayer funds that have gone into political sandbagging of seats; the climate wars' nine years of inaction and scaremongering, leaving it to future generations to deal with a much bigger issue and a much bigger problem; the constant lying by the Prime Minister; the failure to take responsibility—world leaders have called him out, for goodness' sake; his deputy has called him out—the COVID response; the lack of access to rapid antigen tests. How many of us, as representatives of our communities, have experienced that over summer? No-one could get a RAT and, at the same time, we were being told that you had to get yourself tested if you wanted to do anything. That was fine if you were able to. It was a massive failure. The aged-care minister hopped off to the cricket. I don't have a problem with people going to the cricket—I love the cricket—but I do have a problem with Australia's aged-care minister going to the cricket when people are dying, people are not getting fed, people are not able to have a bath or a shower and staff working there are having the most horrendous experiences. I do have a problem with that. Then I have a Prime Minister who says, 'That's okay. Sure, he copped that criticism; no problem,' while the system is in crisis and falling apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place are used to the leadership failures of this Prime Minister. We see them every single day: bushfires, vaccines, aged care, the failure to take responsibility, the blame-shifting to the states—'it's not our fault; it's theirs'—not being straight with people, changing his answer. I remember him saying, 'I really did like electric vehicles. I never said they were going to end the weekend.' Yes, you did, so many times. This is the standard we have set at the top of this government. There is disunity. They cannot solve problems for people if they are too busy fighting themselves, and that is what we are seeing. This Prime Minister is out of touch. He has no understanding of how to deal with the challenges facing the Australian people. They've even given up pretending to govern on behalf of the people of Australia and they should call the election now.</span>

                  </a>  Clearly we have started the election campaign today. It's particularly disappointing that we can operate respectfully for the 2¾ years of an election term and then, all of a sudden, when the time comes, the Greens decide they're going to pull some sort of childish protest-party stunt. And, really disappointingly, the Labor Party decide that they're going to pile on as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we have lived in the most unprecedented of times for the last two years. A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic hit the world. If you look at Australia's track record over the last couple of years, we have the highest vaccination rates of just about any country in the world and we have seen a relatively low number of people lose their lives as a result of COVID. That doesn't in any way diminish the pain and suffering of the people who have lost a loved one as a result of COVID, but it does point to the fact that the provisions and the actions taken by this government have reduced the number of people who, sadly, would have died from COVID. But, at the same time as having high vaccination rates and a relatively low death rate, we have also maintained a strong economy, which all of the experts are suggesting is well placed to rebound from the latest strain, omicron, which has had such a devastating effect across Australia in recent months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no rule book for this. I love the heroes of hindsight that come in here, pretending that they could have done this all so much better—because they can look back and learn about the experiences that we have had and undertaken over two years. They sit here and pass judgement. Well, I've got to say: heroes of hindsight are not people that will make good leaders, and, for the sake of this country, I hope that we don't see a situation where the Australian Greens are in partnership with the Labor Party and inflict on the Australian population the kinds of ridiculous behaviour that we've seen in this place, particularly things like this stunt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also find it really quite extraordinary to come in here and hear the accusations about lies and dishonesty. There is nothing more dishonest than running a scare campaign, telling older Australians that the coalition government intends to put them on the cashless debit card. You know that's not true. You know that is an absolute abject lie and yet you're more than happy to allow your members to post this kind of stuff on their social media sites. You defend it. There is not a skerrick of truth in what you're running as a campaign. So there is some level of irony in you coming in here and making comments about lies when the fact is that you are lying to the Australian public. You are lying to older Australians, trying to scare them into voting for you in an absolutely shameless campaign. You have no regard whatsoever for older Australians who are scared by the kinds of tactics you use. It is absolutely disgraceful. Maybe you should have a look at some of the things that you're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a proud track record in government. Over the last three years, we have achieved some extraordinary things in extraordinary times. We sit here today with 1.1 million more Australians in work than when the pandemic hit. We stand here today with an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent. I think it was Mr Chalmers who commented, when the pandemic started: 'This government will be judged on how many people become unemployed during the pandemic. You will be singularly judged on unemployment.' Well, with a 4.2 per cent unemployment rate and a prediction by many economists and leading lights in Australia that that number could potentially have a three in front of it by the end of the year, I think that we have probably passed Mr Chalmers's test of making sure that we protected Australians' jobs through the pandemic. We did this because we put in place JobKeeper and supported other Australians with the coronavirus supplement, to help Australians through this pandemic. In doing so, we ensured that our economy was strong and was able to rebound after the pandemic had gone through. So to come in here with these pathetic stunts, as the start of an election campaign, makes the Australian Greens look like the disgrace they really are.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  It is amazing, isn't it, that the Greens want to call a vote of no confidence. We see the Labor Party adopting the Greens policies. We see the Liberal Party adopting the Greens policies. We see the current Prime Minister, in the previous election campaign, smashing the Labor Party because they were in favour of a 2050 net zero policy. Now it's part of Liberal-National policy. So it looks like the Greens have no confidence in a government that is adopting Greens policies. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support forcibly injecting people against their will. The Greens have no data with which to back their climate claims, which are now impoverishing people and threatening coalminers' jobs in the Hunter Valley and in Queensland—a major part of Queensland's economy. They will stump the whole economy if we follow the path the government is going down. The Greens lie. They say the temperatures are rising—the temperatures have been flat since 1995, once one compensates for El Nino and La Nina. They are impoverishing the poor and misleading the country. So I have very little confidence in the government but even less confidence in the Labor-Greens alternative. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, leading the government, says that there are no vaccine mandates in this country. That is a lie. It's a dishonest government. Senator Birmingham, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, said that the government has presided over lower fatalities—another falsity. Taiwan has just skittled us in the way it protected its vulnerable people and those with COVID. It has a much lower fatality rate—ours is 4.5 times higher than Taiwan's—because it has a management plan for the virus. Senator Birmingham said, 'We have higher injection rates,' and he was proud of that, proud of coercing everyday Australians, forcing them to get an injection by denying their kids food. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a protest last week in Brisbane. The protest leader went over to the police supervising us, and the police said, 'Keep going, we've got to get away from this control.' One of the policemen said he was injected. The protest leader, Dan McDonald—a wonderful emergency services worker—said, 'How do you feel?' I will always remember this: a grown man saying 'owned'. He feels owned. What a debilitating thing for any man or woman to say. Yet I can understand that. That's not his fault. He has to put food on the table for his kids. It's this government's fault, ably supported by Labor and the Greens. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no plan for managing COVID. It's been completely mismanaged. They've abandoned the vulnerable. They've abandoned the desperate. They've withdrawn Australian citizens' access to a proven treatment, ivermectin. This is the first time in our country's history when healthy people have been forcibly injected. It's the first time when healthy people have been injected with something that can kill them—and is killing them—and it's the first time a government has withdrawn a treatment that is proven to be safe, effective and affordable. This is a government in which I have very little faith, but it's a government that shines because it hasn't quite adopted the Greens policies. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I oppose Senator Waters's motion to suspend standing orders, because it will have no effect. It's a stunt. It gives her time to misrepresent reality, yet again, and Senator Hanson and I do not vote for stunts. We will be opposing this suspension of standing orders.</span>

During this great COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian community—disabled people, older Australians, First Nations peoples, young people—needed their government. They needed their government to listen to them and to act to provide help. And over the last two years this Morrison government, time and time again, have failed. They have let the Australian community down. The Australian community said, 'Let us have vaccinations. Let them get to the people that need them. Let's get it in quick; let's learn from the failures of other jurisdictions around the world as they battled the pandemic,' and the Morrison government let us down. The Australian community said, 'Let us have income supports so that we can focus on getting better, rather than worrying about where our next meal comes from,' and the Morrison government let the community down. The community said, 'Let us access, for everyone, the basics that we need to be safe during the pandemic. Let us access RATs and masks and proper ventilation in our schools to keep our kids safe,' and the Morrison government let the community down. Failure compounded failure, and the outcome was people put at risk and people dying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disabled people in this country will never forgive this feckless government for its disgraceful failure to keep that community safe, to keep our community safe. We will never forgive you, nor will the older Australians of this country, nor will the First Nations peoples of this country and nor will the immunocompromised of this country, for propagating the absolute lie, the total misrepresentation, that it is acceptable for our lives to be lost in this pandemic and that anybody with an underlying condition can be and should be written off as collateral damage. You have done so much harm in your time here. So much good work that needed to be done has gone undone. So much time has been squandered. The work of so many dedicated community members during this pandemic, attempting to keep each other safe, has been undermined by the reality that this government sees human lives far more in dollars and cents than it does in inherent human value.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all these reasons and so much more, this government divided, this government benighted, this government failed and rambling into ruin, must now be swept from this place. A lack of confidence does not nearly cover it. Condemnation and allocation to the dustbin of history is all that you deserve. May you go there and never be thought of nor spoken of again.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I'd like to begin my contribution. Obviously, I'll only get a few minutes before we go into two-minute statements, and we'll resume after that. I rise to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. While I represent the shadow minister for health in this chamber, I offer my support for this bill as an individual senator, not on behalf of the Labor party opposition. It has been decided by the Labor caucus that the debate on and vote for this bill will be a matter of conscience for our members. This bill has been referred to as 'Maeve's Law' after Maeve Hood. Maeve, at the time this bill was introduced, was a five-year-old girl living in Minister Hunt's electorate. Maeve, at 18 months of age, was diagnosed with Leigh syndrome, a severe type of mitochondrial disease. Maeve, by all reports, is a bright, bubbly child but struggles daily with the challenging medical issues arising from her disease. Maeve is one of thousands of Australians who suffer from mitochondrial disease. In fact, it is estimated that one in 200 people, or more than 120,000 Australians, may carry genetic changes that put them at risk of developing mitochondrial disease or other related symptoms, such as deafness, diabetes or seizures, during their lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite its prevalence, it's only in the last few decades that we have really begun to understand mitochondrial disease and its impact. Mitochondrial disease, or 'mito' as it's commonly called, is a very serious genetic disorder that affects mitochondria in our body's cells. Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, process oxygen and convert the food we eat into energy. Mito happens when genetic mutation within the mitochondria causes it to not function as it should, starving cells of energy. Mitochondrial disease is caused by a defect in the mitochondrial DNA of an embryo, which is a type of DNA passed on only through the mother—that is, passed on through the egg cells rather than the sperm cells.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mito is a destructive and debilitating disease and can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Mito is a disease that often proves fatal for very young children. Up to 30 children born in Australia each week are at risk of developing mild to moderately disabling mitochondrial disease, while at least one Australian child born each week will develop a severe or life-threatening form of mitochondrial disease. It has proven very difficult to diagnose due to the range in severity and ways it can present. There are currently very few effective treatments against mito and, as yet, no cure, which leads me to the purpose of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 seeks to allow for the staged introduction of mitochondrial donation techniques in Australia under a strict regulatory framework. Mitochondrial donation is an in vitro fertilisation technique to prevent the transmission of maternally inheritable mitochondrial disease from mother to child. Maternally inheritable mitochondrial disease refers to forms of this disease caused by changes in the mitochondrial DNA, which a child inherits only from its mother. This form of mitochondrial disease is the cause of approximately half of mitochondrial disease cases. Mitochondrial donation can assist in reducing the risk of mothers passing it on to their children. Mitochondrial donation involves transferring nuclear genetic material from the affected mother's egg into a donor egg that has had its nuclear DNA removed and retains only its healthy mitochondrial DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important here to note the distinction between mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA, while incredibly important for the smooth functioning of cells, represents a tiny fraction of our genetic material. Almost all of our genetic material is nuclear DNA, contributed equally by the mother and father. These are the more than 20,000 genes that make up our character, appearance and other qualities that form us as individuals. Mitochondrial donation does not alter the DNA that makes us individuals. The procedure only targets the tiny fraction of DNA that helps convert food and oxygen into energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this procedure can be performed in a number of ways, the two techniques under consideration within this bill are maternal spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer. 'Maternal spindle transfer' means the transfer of the nuclear DNA from the mother into the donor egg, which happens before the fertilisation of the egg. It happens before the donor's egg is fertilised by the father's sperm. The second technique, pronuclear transfer, involves both the donor's egg and the mother's egg being fertilised. The mother's nuclear DNA is removed from her fertilised egg and inserted into the donor's fertilised egg, which has its pronuclear DNA removed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Today, thousands of shifts in aged care are going unfilled every week. Vulnerable residents are suffering appalling conditions and aged-care workers are at breaking point. This is the Morrison government's aged-care system at work in Australia today. And now, after nine years of Morrison government neglect, we're resorting to sending the troops into aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister should have listened to the experts years ago. He should have acted on the royal commission's urgent call for more aged-care workers and for proper pay to keep the dedicated aged-care workers we have. But, in the middle of this crisis, instead of delivering a real plan to properly value these workers, the Prime Minister decided to insult them with a last-minute pre-election $400 bonus pay-off. I asked three aged-care workers what they thought about it. Julie told me, 'This bonus is just meant as a bribe.' Jude called it 'a desperate bid for votes'. Elizabeth said, 'It is insulting.' She also said: 'The Prime Minister should spend a week in a facility, first as a resident, then another in our shoes. If he is not heartbroken and exhausted after that, then he has no soul.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has had nine years to listen to the experts and to respect aged-care workers like Julie, Elizabeth and Jude by coming up with a real plan—a long-term plan to value our aged-care workers and residents. The Prime Minister has dismally failed aged-care workers, has tragically failed aged-care residents and has failed all Australians who expect their government to pass the most basic of tests: protecting our elderly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):   I rise today to speak on the cashless debit card, as I have many times in this place. But today I rise with an update for the Senate—one that I'm particularly proud of and one that I've been working on personally. Last week I joined my friend from the other place the member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, in the Goldfields to open up the first cashless debit card employment support hub. We on this side of the chamber believe in a strong welfare system that supports people into work. The cashless debit card, much maligned by those opposite, is part of this system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the CDC is proving to be a more responsible delivery of welfare payments, it's not the destination. Economic independence through employment is the goal. Employment won't change everything, but without it nothing will change. To this end the CDC is being further supported in the Goldfields by a network of hubs, designed to help those who need specialist assistance to break into the workforce. Whether this is something as simple as obtaining a driver's licence, sourcing necessary ID or accessing the services of an interpreter to better understand the prerequisite requirements, these services and this assistance will be available. Extra funding has also been committed to alcohol and drug rehabilitation services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key role of the hubs is to engage with employers in the region to source employment opportunities. Employers are screaming out for suitably trained and capable employees. Employers are eager to work with the hubs to make sure they understand their requirements and to assist them in sourcing quality candidates and supporting them on the job. The Morrison government has made just under $2.4 million available for these services. I was very pleased to lead the consultation that has seen these services delivered. I thank the local governments across these areas, and I thank them for their support in stepping up to the plate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Australians have around 100 days before this nation goes into one of the most important federal elections, if not the most important, in this country's history. For those Australians who care about the future and future generations of this country, about the environment, about our oceans and about climate action, this is it. This is your opportunity to cast a vote for climate action by voting Greens. We look at the record temperatures we've seen in Western Australia this summer—just another summer of record temperatures. But did we notice that, off the coast of Sydney and at the Great Barrier Reef, we had the warmest water temperatures ever recorded in history, another record from burning fossil fuels?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a party that is keeping it very simple this election. We need to stop all new fossil fuel development in this country, and that's why our leader, Adam Bandt, made it very clear to the national media this week that that is going to be our ask in the next parliament. The Greens will be introducing a 'fight for our coastlines' bill that will do exactly that. Last year, 80,000 square kilometres of our ocean was handed over by this government for more exploration and more oil and gas drilling, putting our coastlines at risk. The Greens will be introducing this bill as soon as we can. I am once again proud to be standing up for coastal communities and those who love our oceans right around this country and saying that, at this time in history, we have no time left to waste before taking the strongest possible action on reducing our emissions, phasing out and ending all fossil fuel exploration and doing the right thing for future generations of this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I draw the attention of the Senate today to the recent decision of the Morrison government to cut funding to peak health organisations across a range of health sectors. Governments, communities and health sectors rely on these trusted, credible services and peak bodies to provide advice and leadership, yet in 2021 the government cut the number of organisations funded and also cut out a number of well-established organisations from receiving funding at all under their peak organisation funding. At a time when we need mental health support and it couldn't be more pressing, the government ended its peak funding for Mental Health Australia and Lifeline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is made all the worse by coming just weeks after the Minister for Health assured organisations like the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations and the National Association of People with HIV Australia of the government's commitment to seeing an end to HIV transmission in Australia. We have seen great gains made in ending HIV transmission in Australia, and NAPWHA and AFAO have been heavily relied upon by the government in meeting those goals. This is not the time to cut their peak funding—a time when we are still to reach zero transmissions here in Australia, a goal that is entirely achievable but only with the support of these organisations, who have a great track record, who have been there since the beginning of the HIV pandemic and who bring the voice of affected communities to the table. Without that voice, governments cannot possibly deliver on these goals.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  [by video link] Today I put on the record One Nation's demand for the establishment of a royal commission into the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by Australian governments. It is essential that there be a comprehensive, honest and transparent examination of how federal, state and territory governments have handled this pandemic, because it has affected every single one of us. Many people have died, families have been separated, the education of our children has been severely disrupted, thousands of Australians have lost their jobs, countless businesses have been closed—in many cases permanently—hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars have been spent, and military personnel and resources have been deployed in Australia, with yet more set to reinforce an exhausted aged-care sector in crisis. How can we not have a royal commission into this unprecedented event? The Australian people deserve nothing less. If we don't learn from and understand the mistakes of this pandemic, we are doomed to repeat them. Last year, this Senate denied—yes, denied!—Australians a parliamentary inquiry into my bill outlawing COVID-19 vaccine discrimination. You denied Australians their say about the pandemic of discrimination that you unleashed upon us. You denied them a say, because you were so frightened your conspiracy to silence the Australian people would be exposed. The people deserve their say in an open and honest accounting of this wretched pandemic. The people deserve to see what justified the decisions which have destroyed so many lives these past two terrible years. One Nation will never stop fighting for a royal commission into this pandemic. </span>

I want to talk about not what the media are focused on but what the Nationals and the government are focused on. That is doing what we were elected to do: creating jobs and supporting businesses. Three years ago when I entered this place, we had seen 28 years of consecutive growth in Australia. COVID threw us a curveball, but it also gave us a unique opportunity to reset and refocus on driving productivity here in our country. That is what the Nationals are focused on doing before and after the coming election. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key to this is grabbing the opportunities that are presented to us by our low-carbon future. Australia is already reaping the benefits of demand for more rare-earth minerals and lithium to build components of solar panels, wind turbines and solar and electric vehicle batteries. This mining adds to our already highly successful resources sector, which has underpinned our economy through COVID, along with the agricultural sector. We are also facilitating our farmers' ability to access new ways to garner carbon credits and new ways to manage their land without threat or fear. Our good commodity prices, our healthy economy despite COVID, and our government's job-ready training and apprenticeships packages have all contributed to unemployment being at an all-time low: 4.2 per cent. That is our government's focus, that is the National Party's focus and that should be our nation's focus. That's what we are striving for. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Of everything the ABC is known for, nothing is more important to Australians and to Australian democracy than its news service. All Australians depend on the ABC for its public interest journalism, but these services are particularly important in regional areas that would otherwise go without any local news coverage. This coverage is absolutely vital for Australians who live outside big metro areas and want to know what is going on in their communities and what their local governments and representatives are doing. The ABC's regional journalists do incredible work. They have won literally hundreds of awards for their coverage over the last decade. They have exposed corruption and wrongdoing and kept regional Australians safe and informed throughout times of crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for this work comes from the Enhanced Newsgathering Program, which sits outside the ABC's base funding. Why? Well, because it is not base funding. It is not automatically rolled over each funding cycle. This means regional journalists have no certainty whatsoever about their ongoing employment. The ABC struggles to attract and retain journalists, who need security in their careers and their finances. The government recently announced that they would extend the program for another three years and increase the funding. I've been advocating for this for years and emphatically welcome that commitment, but I would like the government to bite the bullet and roll this into ABC's base funding. This program deserves to be made permanent. It provides incredible value for money and an essential service to regional Australia. So let's make it a commitment today not to let down regional Australia in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  You know that feeling you get when the big parties aren't working for you anymore? I think I found the reason why. It's pretty simple, actually: it's because normal people just can't afford them. Last week we found out that Liberal and Labor raked in tens of millions of dollars of hidden money in the 12 months to July 2021. That's a lot of very full brown paper bags. They're so full, there's more filling than a Tontine pillow. The worst of it is that we'll never know where the money came from or what it bought, but we know it's buying something—absolutely. No-one in their right mind is handing over millions of dollars because they want Australian democracy to run better. That's not happening. They are not there for the country. It's all about self-interest; I can assure you that much. Donors are dishing it out to look after their own skins. Money buys access. It buys influence and it buys outcomes. It shouldn't be that way, but that's the way it is. That's where we are in 2022, in parliament, in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm fighting to stamp out the Canberra corruption, and our candidates at the next election are too. We have the chance to get democracy back into voters' hands, where it belongs. It's the right thing to do, but it's an uphill battle. We don't have secret money coming from big business or big unions. We don't have megabucks up our sleeves. We do what the Australian people expect us to do: to go and earn our seats. We do not buy them. Buying seats in the Jacqui Lambie Network is just not spoken of, because it will never happen—not while I'm here and not while it wears my family name. We earn them, because that is the Australian way: with our boots on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Welcome back, Madam Acting Deputy President. Last year I rose to speak about why our defence forces should be proud of their efforts in Afghanistan. Today I rise to speak of the humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding there since the Taliban took control of the country again. There are 24 million Afghans in need of humanitarian assistance—more than half of the population—including 13 million children. As a result, Afghanistan now has the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world; over one million Afghan children are at risk of dying due to severe malnutrition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's commitment of $100 million in humanitarian assistance should be one we are proud of, but this should be delivered through the World Food Programme, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Population Fund. It is these multilateral organisations that are best placed to address the humanitarian crisis. Some small NGOs have good local access in some parts of the country, but they can only do so much due to the precarious security environment, and we do not want to put their people at risk of further harm. Yes, there are criticisms of how slow the UN and WFP have been to get aid to the Afghan people, and, yes, they need to do more, but a two-track process is not the answer. The Australian government is not willing to put people at further risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NGOs are used to working with the UN and should be encouraging them to get aid moving faster. The UN can use peacekeeping forces if necessary to ensure aid gets to the people. I thank the NGOs for their brave work and encourage them to work with the UN WFP, not separately from it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  If Russia invades the Ukraine there will be huge consequences for Australia. The EU depends on Russia for about a third of its gas supplies and will need alternative sources if there's a major conflict. Global gas prices will surge. Australia's big gas exporters and the government have rushed to offer additional LNG gas to the EU should Russia reduce or shut down the gas it supplies, but where will that leave our gas market?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's domestic gas policy is a total failure. It's an absurdity that Australia, a huge exporter of gas, is now building import terminals. We export our cheap gas to the Asian market and we leave the expensive gas here for our manufacturers. In the best of times the gas cartel makes sure our manufacturers are at a disadvantage. We have to take action on this, and back in 2019 I talked to the government about the need to have a reservation policy, which the government announced but has not implemented. It's a breach of an undertaking given to me in writing by the government in June 2019. Two and a half years later, that's another betrayal by this government, which is always putting big business ahead of manufacturers and Australian consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now vulnerable to any disruption in the global market. If there's war in the Ukraine, Australian consumers, manufacturers and households will take another hit from a spike in gas prices, while the big exporters will be laughing all the way to the bank on our gas. That's apparently the government's perception of national security. What a joke!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here now nearly 10 years after the election of this tired, stale Liberal-National government. What have we got to show, as a country, for 10 years of Liberal-National government? We have an aged-care system in crisis; we have Australian wages not keeping up with the cost of living; we have GP shortages across the country; and any business you talk to will tell you that they are screaming for skilled workers because of the skills shortages this government has presided over. On any measure, this government has been a complete failure, and it has a long list of things that it should be doing in the run-up to this election. Instead, what are the government focused on? They're focused on leaking text messages against each other. That is what is occupying the minds of the most senior people in this country as we come to the end of this term. The government have become a bad episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mean Girls</span>—leaking on each other and spreading rumours about each other, rather than focusing on the things that matter to the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happening around my home state of Queensland while the government choose just to leak on each other? The Jeta Gardens aged-care facility, south of Brisbane, is in complete meltdown, with the deaths from COVID of 15 aged residents, and 182 residents and staff testing positive for COVID. Further north, in Rockhampton, people are waiting a month to see a GP, with specialists' costs spiralling out of control under this government's watch. In Gracemere, outside Rocky, we've got GP clinics refusing to take on patients, because they can't employ enough doctors. In Emerald it takes six months to get an appointment with a psychologist. These are the things that this Liberal-National government should have fixed in nearly 10 years, rather than just spreading rumours and sending texts about each other. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time ex</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Over the summer, I again had the opportunity to travel across Western Australia's Kimberley region. Those of us who are familiar with the Kimberley will know it for its rugged charm, its waterways, particularly in the wet season that we're experiencing now, and most particularly, of course, the resilience of people living across Kimberley communities. But I'm disappointed to have to share with the Senate today what is a new and emerging challenge for those people and communities across the Kimberley who choose to make the Kimberley their home and the place of their small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During those travels, I was surprised to hear the depth of concern, frustration and disappointment from people who have lived in Kimberley towns and communities for years upon years—since their birth, in some cases—and to hear the stories they are now telling me of an escalation in crime and violence not seen before. We know there are many politicians who would be quick to point the finger at other politicians about the need to do more. But, in standing before the Senate today, I know that my colleagues Senator Dodson and Senator Cox, who have great passion for my home state of Western Australia and great passion for northern Australia, are interested in working together to make sure that we can tackle these issues.</span>
              </p>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Everyone will come to this debate with their own philosophical view. I am someone who believes that we should trust the data first. Let's have a look at what the data is telling us. I don't believe that more money is the answer. I do believe that greater coordination between state and federal officials is important. I do believe the federal government can take on a greater responsibility on some particular matters, and I'll name one of those. It's very clear on what has been shared with me by local people that social media is emboldening the attitudes of some very, very young people. TikTok—I'm not familiar with it, but this is an opportunity for the federal government to think laterally and to exercise much greater influence over these important but terrible issues— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are witnessing these policies enacted on a large scale through mass seizures of Palestinian land and property, forcible transfers, drastic movement restrictions and the denial of nationality and citizenship. It's also seen on an individual level, through forced family home expulsions and discriminatory judicial processes. The report follows a long list of other institutions and human rights organisations—international, Palestinian and Israeli—that have analysed the situation and confirmed that the policies of successive Israeli governments constitute apartheid.</span>

That's been our focus all along. Have we got everything right? No, we haven't, and we've admitted that. We've had the courage to admit that. We haven't played nasty personal games like the Labor Party have. We haven't gone down that track. There's been not a single constructive discussion or contribution from those on the other side! But we have put all of the resources of government towards the support of the aged-care sector, and that's what we will continue to do. We are very comfortable continuing to work cooperatively with the aged-care sector—the providers, who we talk to on a regular basis, and their peaks—in the case of helping them to work their way through the current situation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I made some decisions with respect to the events that I attended over that period of time, but I was always available, and I always continued to work in respect of supporting the aged-care sector.

Globally we've seen yet another wave of the challenges resulting from COVID-19, just as we've seen the waves of COVID-19 continue. The most recent wave that has challenged the globe, of course, has been the omicron wave. We've seen a huge spike in case numbers right around the world, but, thankfully it's a less severe variant than has previously been faced. I want to thank all Australians for what they have done over the past two years but particularly during the recent summer season in the face of the global challenges of COVID-19. Together, the resilience and efforts of Australians have achieved remarkable outcomes—some of the lowest fatality rates in the world, some of the highest vaccination rates in the world, some of the strongest economic outcomes in the world. More than 51 million vaccinations have been applied across our country, with around 94 per cent of those aged over 16 fully vaccinated and more than nine million people having had a booster.</span>

As we do that we are able to continue to work towards the normalisation of the treatment of COVID as we live more effectively with COVID, with a highly vaccinated population. From 21 February, in just 13 days, we will see our international borders reopen to tourists, giving a much needed lift to our tourism industry, a further step in our economic plan that has kept Australians secure in their jobs, kept Australian businesses stronger and has enabled our economy to withstand its biggest test in decades. We are one of only nine countries in the world to still have a AAA credit rating intact even with the spending incurred through COVID. Our inflation is well below that of other advanced economies. Our unemployment is at a 13-year low. These economic outcomes are facts and are testament to the fact that Australia's policies worked to help keep Australians safer and more secure. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

More Australians are in work today than ever before. Indeed, 1.7 million additional jobs have been created during the time of our government. Unemployment today stands, in its last recorded figures, at 4.2 per cent. That is a 13-year low. These are economic outcomes that would very much be the envy of so many other nations of the world. Just one year ago, unemployment was 6.6 per cent. It's now at 4.2 per cent. We see women's workforce participation at its highest level with more than one million additional Australian women in jobs than was the case when our government was elected. Youth unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 2008. Again, investment in trades and in apprenticeships has helped to drive outcomes there, protecting young Australians from the ravages that previous recessions and economic downturns have inflicted upon them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They have worked in terms of supporting those businesses—hundreds of thousands of livelihoods and Australian businesses. Our continued support through tax relief for Australians means more than 11 million Australian families are enjoying the benefits of lower income taxes with $1½ billion a month extra going into the pockets of those Australian households. The support of the HomeBuilder program and the home guarantee scheme will see more than 300,000 Australians helped into homeownership even in these challenging international times. Our $110 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects and the 220,000 trade apprentices in training are the consequence of targeted, effective policies that we have put in place to help keep Australians secure.</span>

That is the result of the work that the sector has done in conjunction with government. That is due to the infection control leads that were put in there and funded by the government back in 2020.

The Prime Minister has said that he's committed to making workplaces safe, but Commissioner Jenkins's earlier report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>, made it clear that a positive duty on employers is critical to achieving that. Your party voted against that. Then we were told at last estimates that consultation on the positive duty would start in December, with a view to implementation by late March. We're now in the second week of February, with only a handful of sitting days before an election, and none of this has happened. How can women in this country have any confidence that this government is committed to making any workplace safe for them?</span>

The government has been clear: we believe this requires further consultation to assess how such a duty would operate effectively alongside existing duties under various work health and safety laws and, indeed, under the Sex Discrimination Act, including to ensure that additional complexity is not created for those seeking to use such protections. We are working through those consultation processes to make sure that any changes that are put in place operate as intended and do not result in unnecessary duplication, confusion or uncertainty for either employers or employees.</span>

He recognises the important work around <span style="font-style:italic;">Respe</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ct@Work</span>, which is why, under Prime Minister Morrison, the government has been pursuing the vast majority of those recommendations.

I'm disappointed that you have raised that question in that way. As I have said publicly today, my office asked the Australian Human Rights Commission last week to contact all those for whom they had contact details who had participated in Commissioner Jenkins's review. My understanding is that they did that. That is my understanding. I can't speak for contacting those individuals because, as you well know, we put in place legal protections for all those who participated and so the government has no way of contacting all those who participated in the review. We did, as you knew we had said we would do and as I had said publicly we would do, ask the AHRC to do that. My advice is that that's what they did. </span>

This government, the Morrison government, is a job-creating government. When you look at the labour force figures in December, they were positive news for all Australians. They show that new businesses and new jobs are being created right across the country. This government's economic plan has always been based on getting Australians into work—creating jobs and getting Australians off welfare and into work. That is exactly what's happening as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. When you look at the evidence in relation to the employment figures, the unemployment rate has decreased to 4.2 per cent. That is now lower than when we came into office in 2013. The participation rate—that's Australians putting their hands up and saying, 'I'm ready, willing and able to work'—continues to be strong, remaining steady at 66.1 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 60,000 jobs were created in the month of December. That is because of those fantastic employers across Australia. What that means is that employment is now at a record high in Australia, with 13,242,000 Australians in work. There are, in fact, now 246,600 more Australians in work than there were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. When you look to the employment-to-population ratio, that itself has increased to 63.3 per cent. People often ask about underemployment. That has now decreased—that is a good thing—to 6.6 per cent. So, when we talk about putting in place the right policies so that businesses out there can prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians, the statistics speak for themselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That has, of course, helped businesses retain staff, because quite often it's the young person, the apprentice, that is the first person to be let go. We've ensured that, by our investment in the skills and training system, employers have been able to keep those young people and those apprentices on, and this further supports that pipeline of workers in Australia. </span>

What they were saying was two million Australians could have been out of work. Then you look at the policy response from the coalition government. Look at where we are now. In December 2021, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 per cent. We're at near record high participation. That is a good thing. Over $300 billion in health and economic support, provided through our economic plan, has helped us to reach this point. It is because of the policies put in place by the coalition government that Australians are in work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I indicated in an earlier answer today, the sector has performed extremely well in the context of the number of infections in aged care compared to those in the broader community. My thanks and congratulations, again, go to the sector and the workforce, who have done a magnificent job in managing this. We continue to work with the quality commission to ensure that all providers meet the quality standards. That's the role the quality commission has, and it continues to work in that sense. Of course the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been absolutely tragic, and I again extend my condolences to all those who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, the Morrison government's economic plan is clearly working. Today there are over one million more women in work than when we came to government. Let me say that again: today there are over one million more women in work under a coalition Liberal-National government. This is not something that happens by accident. It can only have been made possible because of the economic policies that have been put in place, intentionally, by this government. We currently have the highest women's employment-to-population ratio Australia has ever seen—more Australian women in work than ever before. Women's workforce participation is hovering at record levels and women's underemployment is steadily heading consistently down. All of this has been achieved with the background of a global pandemic.</span>

Our government's commitment to enhancing the economic security of Australian women extends well beyond economic management. In the 2020-21 budget, we made a landmark commitment and investment of $1.9 billion to improve the affordability of child care by increasing the child care subsidy for families with multiple children. For women who want to return to the workforce, to take on training, to study or to volunteer, the decision to take on the cost of child care is made more affordable.</span>

Let's be clear: from skills to child care, from leadership to board appointments and, most importantly, job opportunities, we are backing Australian women to get the choices and chances that they deserve, that we deserve. Australian women can rest assured that this government's economic plan will maximise opportunities as we continue to recover from the pandemic. I can certainly promise you, Mr President, that we won't be slugging them with higher taxes. We won't be proposing a retiree tax, for instance, damaging their retirement savings. We certainly won't be bringing in $387 billion of new or higher taxes, smashing their jobs and robbing women of opportunities. While the child care subsidy is currently up to 95 per cent for those families with two or more children who want to work, study or volunteer, we certainly won't be bringing in free child care for millionaires while regular women work longer hours to pay the taxes to pay for such a scheme.</span>

That's why the Women's Budget Statement this year committed to a full review of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to determine how government can further work alongside the private sector to collectively close the gender pay gap.

Minister, there are 75 politicians up here right now who own a second home in Canberra. Each and every one of them can claim the full rate of travel allowance—nearly 300 bucks—to sleep in the comfort of their own bed this evening. That's $20,000 in free money going out to 75 politicians tonight alone. I reckon it should be illegal for politicians to claim full travel allowance to sleep in their own bed. It's not allowed anywhere else in the country, so why should Canberra be any different?</span>

The rates of travel allowance and arrangements for travel allowance are set independently through the Remuneration Tribunal. It has been a longstanding practice that, in relation to the rates paid for members and senators to stay in Canberra relative to the rates paid in other capital cities, there is a discounted rate applied in Canberra, recognising and, indeed, encouraging members and senators to make longer-term arrangements in relation to their accommodation in Canberra. That's a private matter for each member and senator to undertake, but the government stands by the independent process of the Remuneration Tribunal on these matters.</span>

In terms of the cost effectiveness for the government's finances, it would concern me were we in a situation that changes were made that potentially increased the cost by increasing the nightly rate that was paid. Again I back the independent processes there that seek to find the right approach to respect taxpayers' dollars, to minimise costs where possible and to ensure that, indeed, recompense is made to enable members and senators to make their own arrangements for overnight accommodation as is necessary in Canberra.</span>

He says he has no plans to change the rules either; he doesn't see a need to. I just wanted to clarify this: to the best of your knowledge, the Liberal Party, the Nationals and the Labor Party are on a unity ticket because of their own sense of self-entitlement when it comes to claiming this money from the taxpayer.</span>

What we are indeed backing is an independent process that has been in place for many years for the Remuneration Tribunal to make independent assessments at arm's length from politicians. I am not, as finance minister, and Mr Morton is not, as Special Minister of State, responsible for setting the rates, terms or arrangements for travel allowances. It is, of course, a fact that every one of us here aside from Senator Gallagher, Senator Seselja and perhaps Senator Molan travel here away from our homes and do incur costs of some form or other in relation to the accommodation while we are here. As I said, it's been a longstanding practice the Remuneration Tribunal has applied in terms of the flexibility of that, but that is also reflected in the different rates as they are calculated, and that's why the independent approach is the appropriate approach.</span>

Just 26 days later, Mr Morrison backflipped. Isn't this just another example of the Morrison-Joyce government doing too little too late?</span>

The announcement that we made yesterday was to pull together some targeted support for aged-care facilities that were in significant distress—that's what we announced yesterday—and to build teams in each state to support providers in each state. The Defence Force is not a shadow workforce. It is not a shadow workforce. The Prime Minister said that when the proposal was first put on the table, and he repeated it yesterday. So it would be nice if Labor senators opposite actually took notice of what was happening rather than just playing politics. They are exploiting the pandemic rather than doing what we're doing, which is dealing with the pandemic.</span>

The measure that we introduced yesterday was a targeted approach to support particular facilities that are at significant levels of stress with respect to workforce. That's what we're doing. We are not providing a shadow workforce, as that lot over there dishonestly try to imply. That's not what we're doing. Yes, unfortunately, over the course of the pandemic—</span>

The approach that the Labor Party are taking, demonising the sector, and the effects are making it very, very difficult for us to strike the appropriate balance between residents having visitors and residents not having visitors and being locked in their rooms. Their approach is actually hurting residents in aged care, not helping them.</span>

Minister, we've recently seen some extensive flooding across Australia—including in my state, around Griffith in the Riverina; to the north of the state; in Queensland; in Western Australia; and in South Australia—to the point where we have seen disruptions to our freight supply chains as well as incredible damage to a lot of small businesses and farms.

Thank you so much, Senator Davey, for the question. With La Nina, the floods that over the last three months have swept across our nation, particularly the east coast, have been catastrophic and devastating, with the loss of so many lives. We stand shoulder to shoulder with affected communities and individuals as they make their way through natural disasters, respond and recover, and build natural resilience into the future. We've got the $85 million Natural Hazards Research Australia money. We've got $40 million dedicated to strata resilience. For the North Queensland flood recovery, we were able to put $1.58 billion on the table. There is $2.8 billion which has been committed to the bushfire recovery and $600 million for preparing Australia to better respond to natural disasters in the future. There has been $13 billion from this government to assist impacted workers through the COVID response, through both the pandemic leave disaster payment and the COVID disaster payment. Our government has put in $12 billion, in conjunction with states and territories, to support these affected communities through natural disaster.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, no government in our nation's history has stood with Australians in times of need like the Liberal-National government has. Through bushfires, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and COVID, this government has been providing boots on the ground and financial assistance to both individuals and communities to help them in their time of crisis. We're helping people recover with funding for clean-ups and financial assistance for small businesses and primary producers. In the last three months alone, we've activated assistance for natural disasters 20 times, with $50,000 grants for primary producers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We live in the country of droughts and flooding rains. The next natural disaster is simply around the corner. In this country, we spend 97 per cent of our money and effort on responding to a natural disaster and only three per cent in preparing for the next one. Our government is fundamentally flipping the response of the federal government in this country to get ahead of that. The Labor government is playing games and politicking with the Emergency Response Fund. It is being used and spent in exactly the way it was designed—in fact, in exactly the way the Labor Party voted for it to be used and spent. The fundamental issue they seem to forget is that this is a future fund. That side of politics has not seen a future fund they cannot wait to raid, that they cannot wait to spend in the here and now. They're salivating to get their hands on it, instead of actually ensuring this money is put away to prepare for catastrophic disasters in our nation's future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That agency is the NRRA. The government's National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy positions Australia to better anticipate and adapt to climate variability, improving climate information services to contribute to our future disaster preparedness. Under our government, $210 million has been invested to ensure Australian Climate Services was stood up, to use world-leading expertise and to focus on supporting the NRRA and Emergency Management Australia decisions related to preparedness, response and community recovery from disaster.

Experts have warned that, without urgent action, koalas will become extinct by 2050. Loss of habitat, climate change and extreme weather are the biggest threats to our koala population, yet the environment minister has signed off on projects like the Brandy Hill quarry expansion, the Vickery coalmine expansion and even the rail line to Adani that will decimate koala habitat and make climate change even worse. Why is this so-called Minister for the Environment putting the interests of mining companies and their big developer mates ahead of our koalas and our environment? </span>

The Morrison government is taking action and investing $50 million over four years to boost the long-term protection and recovery efforts for koalas. This investment will protect and restore koala habitat, it will improve our understanding of koala populations, it will strengthen research into koala health and it will support training in koala care and treatment. This new package takes the Morrison government's investment in koala recovery to more than $74 million since 2019.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Threatened Species Scientific Committee has been undertaking a reassessment of the status of the listed koala, following the impacts of bushfires and in addition to other threats such as land clearing, dogs, cars and disease. The Minister for the Environment, Minister Ley, is currently considering the advice within statutory time frames. The draft national plan for the listed koala has been revised in response to the submissions provided during the public comment period, and the government intends to formally make that plan public as soon as possible. By working together with state and territory governments, with researchers, with land managers, with veterinarians and with community groups, we can all protect the koala for generations to come. </span>

The management of habitat protection and the management of land clearing are primarily the responsibilities of state governments, but, where there are potential impacts on matters of national environmental significance, including the clearance of koala habitat, these may in fact require separate Commonwealth approval. The Commonwealth will thus continue to play a leadership role and to support the coordination of conservation outcomes for the koala across its range.</span>

Now that the Threatened Species Scientific Committee have undertaken their assessment of the species, the minister is currently considering their final advice in line with the statutory time frames.</span>

We would ask the government please to consider restoring, by another motion tomorrow, the open-ended adjournment debate to tomorrow evening rather than this evening. The government will make their own response to that.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear from the outset: Senator Richard Colbeck has repeatedly demonstrated, over a prolonged period of time, that he is incapable of fulfilling the task of looking after the interests of older, vulnerable Australians. For this matter alone, this minister should resign. If he does not have the decency to resign, the integrity to resign, the self-awareness to resign, the Prime Minister should sack him. And, if the Prime Minister will not sack this minister, then he confirms he does not have the character to lead this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aged-care sector is in an absolute crisis. It's the third year of this pandemic. There were almost 12,000 aged-care residents and workers infected with COVID in more than 1,100 facilities as of Friday. There have been over 600 deaths amongst aged-care residents this year. Tens of thousands of aged-care residents are still waiting for a booster dose. Aged-care facilities have been left without rapid antigen tests and PPE. Aged-care residents have been left without food, water and medical care because the government, in a third year of a pandemic, after last year's diabolical handling of COVID in aged care, failed to learn and failed to plan. This government always acts too little too late and only acts when there's an absolute crisis on its hands. We have had hundreds of Australians in aged care die of COVID. How many deaths would have been preventable if only this aged-care minister had acted?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that the Morrison-Joyce government ignored aged care. It's all there in one word: neglect. That is not my word. That is the word chosen by the royal commission into aged care to title their interim report: <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. This is a government that neglected older citizens in aged care before the pandemic, neglected them in the pandemic and continues to neglect them to this day. We had a clarion call from the former Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Mike Baird, who is now CEO of HammondCare, begging this government to send in the Australian Defence Force 26 days ago. The Prime Minister rejected it. This minister rejected it. This minister said the sector was performing exceptionally well. Those were his words. And he felt so relaxed and comfortable about the aged-care sector that he toddled off to the cricket for three days.</span>

                  </a>  Well, he probably did get booed, Senator Bilyk; you make an excellent point. He got booed at the cricket and he should get booted out of his job. It is an absolute disgrace. It is an utter disaster. Disease is running rampant through under-resourced facilities. There are too few staff to care for those living there. Our greatest generation has been left unwashed and without food. Have you no shame? Have you no responsibility? Have you no care? What happened to ministerial responsibility under this government? Where has it gone? Was it ever there? If Richard Colbeck can have job security under this government, it is absolutely clear that there is almost nothing you can't fail at and still be confident of retaining your job under Mr Morrison, who takes no responsibility, who tried to blame the states and other people for the outbreaks of COVID in aged care. He was warned, by the way, on rapid antigen tests. So many people warned him. Katie Allen warned him. The call was coming from inside the House, by the way. The business community warned him. The Transport Workers Union warned him. He was warned that we would need rapid antigen tests and just like his 'It's not a race' approach to vaccines, it was not a race to get those rapid antigen tests—failing older Australians and leaving them behind. To those people who say, 'What would it do to change the minister?': it would send a clear message that this government gives a brass razoo about older people in aged care! Let somebody else—anybody else!—have responsibility for this portfolio, because surely nobody could do as bad a job as the incompetent aged-care minister in the absolute crisis—the C-word he dares not utter—in aged care. The Prime Minister has acknowledged there is a crisis. The Prime Minister backflipped and sent in the ADF. The next thing the Prime Minister needs to do is sack the minister for aged care.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Vic</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">e-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  Well, we have yet another example that it's all politics and zero policy from those opposite. It's all personality attacks and little focusing on the substance of issues that need to be addressed. When you listen to those opposite, you'd be forgiven for thinking there is some sort of alternative universe Australia could operate in—an alternative universe in which COVID can be locked in a box and somehow kept away, an alternative universe in which omicron is not the significant global game changer it is. But that's not true. That is not the reality of the world we face. We face a global pandemic, a highly infectious global pandemic—a global pandemic which has produced new variants that are more infectious and more transmissible and that, through that, have created new challenges. Those variants have, however, become less lethal, thankfully, and less likely to lead to severe hospitalisation and severe health outcomes. We can be grateful for that. The reality is COVID is spreading throughout the world. Omicron has seen a huge surge in case load right throughout the world, and no country has demonstrated that, when you have omicron COVID spreading throughout your community, you're somehow going to be able to completely keep it out of different sectors of your community, such as the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than denigrate the aged-care sector and aged-care workers, our government thanks them; I want to, and I know Minister Colbeck does. Does this motion that Senator Keneally has moved today thank aged-care workers anywhere in it? No, it doesn't. Does this motion thank aged-care operators anywhere in it? No, it doesn't. Does it acknowledge the circumstances? No. It's just a political diatribe we're seeing here, typical of the Labor Party. If there were a silver bullet to address the challenges in aged care, in dealing with omicron COVID-19, not only would we have sought to deliver that as a government; it might have provided a policy idea for those opposite, because they've shown no policy idea in the aged-care sector today—not a single policy idea from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has ensured 100 per cent of residential aged-care facilities have been visited by in-reach clinics to deliver booster doses. We have provided surge workforce capacity. More than 80,000 shifts have been filled by surge workforce, including nurses, GPs, care workers, allied health workers and executive ancillary staff. There is the private health agreement in place to utilise private hospital staff, with furloughing changes made to minimise the loss of staff due to requirements to isolate. In terms of PPE, we have seen more than 42 million masks, more than 15 million gowns, more than 43 million gloves, more than 12 million goggles and nearly 11 million rapid antigen tests delivered throughout the aged-care sector. We have made sure 50,000 treatments have been sent out to aged-care facilities across the country, ensuring that we prioritise those facing outbreak.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Keneally goes on: 'When are they getting their boosters?' All facilities have had the opportunity for people to have a booster, Senator Keneally. It is not the case that everybody will choose to have a booster. Some people won't choose to have a booster, because the reality is that some people in aged care are already in palliative care. Some people in aged care are part of end-of-life management. It is a sad reality, but it's a true reality that those opposite are blinkered to. They ignore the fact that these truths exist and pretend there is some sort of alternative universe. Even when we address the broader questions of aged care, this government, under Minister Colbeck and Minister Hunt, has provided an $18 billion response to the royal commission. It's a comprehensive response, dealing with more places in home care, dealing with minimum standards in residential care and lifting those standards in a range of different ways. We have responded comprehensively to the aged-care royal commission report, and our response contrasts with no response from those opposite—no response aside from the type of rubbish that is bowled up today, the type of politicisation that is bowled up today, rather than the acknowledgment of the challenges and the hard work of those who are helping this sector get through some of the most challenging times. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He has failed in his most basic of duties as a government minister, and that is to be keeping people safe. We are supporting this motion today because of the 587 people who have died in aged care in just the first five weeks of 2022, on top of all of the people who have died of COVID in aged care throughout 2020 and 2021. The minister has failed. There would have been fewer deaths from COVID of people in aged care if this government had been competent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have failed in the vaccine rollout in aged care. They have failed to provide boosters to everyone in aged care who wanted to be boostered. They have failed to provide the PPE that workers and visitors in aged-care homes need. They have failed to provide the rapid antigen tests that are needed. We have a situation where nurses and aged-care workers still have to pay for their own RATs. They have failed to provide the adequate working conditions to support nurses and aged-care workers to continue working in aged care, and they have failed to provide that support such that we know that 20 per cent of nurses have said they want to leave working in aged care in the next year. Frankly, they have done an amazing job over the last years. I do not blame them because of the conditions they're having to be working under because of the actions of this government. This minister has failed to do all of that. But, of course, he didn't fail to get to the cricket. Apparently that was a priority! And never mind that he earnt more in that day he went to the cricket than the aged-care bonus they have promised workers.</span>

And to the residents who are tired and frustrated and anxious and locked down in aged-care homes: we hear your frustration. To the aged-care workers, who are doing ceaseless hours, waiting desperately for the support and recognition you deserve: we hear your anger. The minister may think that it's acceptable to go to the cricket while people die; we do not.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I will, of course, be supporting the motion moved by Senator Keneally today. To start at the very top: there is no fundamentally greater responsibility for any government than to keep its citizens safe. It's there to protect every Australian. What we have at the moment is a catastrophic failure of keeping elderly Australians safe. This minister and this government have been unable to do that. There is no greater example of the shambles that is this government—their disunity and their infighting and the distractions, taking away from actually dealing with the issues that everyday Australians face—than the crisis in aged care, the crisis in aged care that the minister for aged-care services refuses to acknowledge. There is a crisis. You cannot fix a situation if you don't acknowledge the crisis that is there right now. Everyone is saying it's a crisis. The workers in the sector, the families who have loved ones and individual residents are saying they've never seen the quality of care so poor as what they are experiencing right now. More than half of aged-care facilities have outbreaks, affecting thousands of staff and thousands of residents. There have been 587 deaths since January—587 deaths in the last 39 days—and the defence of that by this minister and Minister Hunt is, firstly, 'Oh well, you're old, so you're going to die anyway.' The second defence one is: 'Oh well, there's a lot of COVID out there. Therefore, sorry, aged care: you're just going to get it. And unfortunately, because you're old, it's going to be more severe for you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had the benefit of seeing what has happened in the Northern Hemisphere for two seasons now. And we saw what happened in Victoria. We understood the need to get vaccinated and to get boostered, and to keep those facilities safe with PPE, testing and a workforce. Yet here we are, with more widespread community transmission, and what do we see? We see failures of PPE, failures of workforce, failures of testing, and failures for people living in those facilities. They're isolated, dislocated, and in their dying moments are hoisted out of the facility and into hospital. And this minister went to the cricket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sorry, Minister, if you think I'm misrepresenting this, but you told me you didn't want resources diverted away from dealing with what was happening in aged care. That's what you told me. I took that at face value. I didn't hold a hearing without your attendance, and you popped up at the cricket. That is exactly what happened. You said you were too busy dealing with the crisis and that you couldn't come. When you go outside and talk to people who are witnessing what's happening in aged care—and they talk to me about that—they don't think it passes the pub test. So don't try to rewrite it: you made the decision to go to the cricket when aged care was in crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister, whom we are holding to account today, is not a new minister. This minister took on his first portfolio responsibilities in 2004. He has been minister for aged-care services for the last 2½ years—it's not like he is learning the job. We've had report after report. We've had an interim report from the royal commission entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. Someone has to take responsibility for this failure. This government won't take responsibility. The Senate must stand up and speak on behalf of all of the people in aged care and the loved ones who are contacting my office, incredibly upset that they weren't able to be with their loved ones when they were passing away. They were locked out, hearing their loved one on the phone telling them they hadn't been showered or eaten any food. That's the anger out there about aged care. We are not playing politics with this. These are older Australians in their most vulnerable moments, and this government pretends it has done everything it can, saying, 'It's just a pandemic,' and, 'Then Omicron came.' Well, it's not good enough. That's why this minister should resign, and the Prime Minister should sack him if he doesn't. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  What will this achieve? Think about what's happening in my state of Queensland. Forced vaccinations by the federal government have driven aged-care workers into resignation. They've abandoned their jobs—after being heroes for 18 months. Staff are crying because they don't want to leave residents in aged-care facilities in the lurch but they also don't want to have that mandated injection. Look at what else is happening in Queensland. Forced vaccinations in health care are destroying our hospital system. We have a so-called pandemic—there's no pandemic of deaths, but we apparently have a threat—and the response from the state government is to destroy its own health system. A Labor state government is destroying health care. Nurses are resigning. Nurses are being left out because they don't want to get injected. At the same time, we are told we are going to face an imminent hospital crisis. This doesn't make sense, whether it's the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, at a time when there's increasing load on the police to enforce capricious lockdowns and other restrictions and we're taking police off duty to do those jobs, we're standing aside police officers because they won't get injected. We're threatening people such as our emergency services workers, staff in aged care, teachers, nurses, doctors, police, NDIS workers and firies. We're threatening them. We're sacking them so they can't feed their kids because we're going against a 3,000-year-old principle of doctor-patient confidentiality, privacy and bodily autotomy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it doesn't matter whether we look at this mob or this mob. They're both reckless and dishonest. So I ask them again: what will this achieve? The Labor Party is full of talk but no action. They've got two or three months until an election. Where is their plan? Instead of suspending the standing orders today, let's have their plan and put it to the people of Australia. Let's see them decide at the next election who is competent to manage this country. At the moment, neither of them are. That's why we keep saying to people, 'Put the majors last.' In 70 years, they have destroyed this country—absolutely destroyed it—by giving in to the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and now this rubbish. We will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders. There's an election. Let the people right across this country decide.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Sport and Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  It is really disappointing that the Labor Party are using this opportunity to play politics with the pandemic, rather than being constructive in actually dealing with it. They talk about the royal commission. It's nearly a year since the royal commission brought down its final report,<span style="font-style:italic;"> Respect, care and dignity</span>. Yet what is the plan from the Labor Party to deal with aged care after the royal commission report? It is a comprehensive report. We have not only responded to every recommendation but put over $18 billion on the table for the reform of the sector. But their response is, 'We'll spend more than the other mob.' That's it. That's all we get from Labor. They play their dirty, personal, nasty politics. That's what they do. That's what their whole plan is. We saw that before Christmas. That's what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an extraordinarily difficult circumstance. It's not just a pandemic; this is a global pandemic. We have a deadly virus. People will contract it throughout the community and, tragically, some of them will die. We work, from the Prime Minister down, within this government every day in support of all Australians with respect to the pandemic. We took action early and closed the borders. We put the private hospital agreement in place to support the state health systems when they needed it, and they did need it during January of this year through the omicron outbreak. That private hospital agreement has also provided support for residents in aged care in the context of surge workforce and during 2020, in particular, beds for residents who needed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We vaccinated the aged-care population in 2021. We commenced the vaccination booster program for aged-care residents on 8 November last year. On 12 December, or thereabouts, we got advice to accelerate the program. On Christmas Eve, we got advice to accelerate it even further. The period between vaccination and booster was shortened. All through early January this year, we set out to bring forward the boosters for every facility in the country, and now every facility has received boosters, and we've started going around again. We've done over 130 facilities for a second time, and, as of last night, 77.4 per cent of those residents eligible for a booster have taken up that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to work in the interests of residents. We've provided vaccines. We've provided PPE throughout the program. Have there been some problems along the way? Yes, there have been. Of course there have been. We had supply chain problems earlier this year, which is what we were working out when the Senate and Senator Gallagher wanted us to be there on that morning when the hearings were supposed to be held. That morning, not while I was at the cricket, we were working on bringing the vaccines forward and we were working on ensuring that the rapid antigen tests and the PPE required were getting to aged-care facilities. Have there been some issues there? Yes. So we continue to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party can play their dirty, nasty personal politics, and we know that's their campaign strategy, but they have no plan. Why would you trust the mob that couldn't safely insulate your ceiling to run the response to a pandemic? Why would you trust them to do that? They could not build a school hall. How can they manage the recovery from a pandemic? How can they do that? We, from the Prime Minister down, have applied our attention to supporting Australians through the pandemic. We will continue to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, some Australians are going to catch the virus, and, absolutely tragically, we all know the impact of a personal loss. We all feel that. We've all felt that loss. We extend our condolences to all those who have suffered that loss, but our focus will be on managing the pandemic, while the opposition play politics with the pandemic.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  As other speakers from Labor have said today, older Australians deserve our respect, our support and our love. Instead, from this minister and this government they get neglect, they get cuts and they get blame-shifting and excuses. Instead of our respect and our support, they have a minister who presides over a rolling crisis, a crisis that has existed since he took on the role and that has only got worse as we have faced COVID-19. Instead of our support and our respect, older Australians, their families and the aged-care workforce get a minister who sees aged care as a part-time job, something he fits around his trips to the cricket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have known about the horror stories in aged care for years. There was a royal commission into it which exposed the neglect, which exposed the elderly Australians sitting with open wounds, unable to get the care that they need because of staffing shortages, because of underpayment of aged-care workers, because of underresourcing of the sector. We have known about this for years, and yet we continue to read about it, to hear about it, to watch it, to see it with our own eyes, in our own families, everywhere around the country. Rather than knuckling down and actually getting these problems fixed, getting the workers paid what is needed to attract and keep people in the workforce, making sure that providers use the funding they get transparently so that funds are used to support the elderly Australians in aged-care facilities, we have a minister who decides his priority is going to see a cricket match for three days. It's not as if time couldn't have been spent in those three days continuing to fix the problems in the aged-care facilities. There's no shortage of problems. There's no shortage of recommendations about what needs to be done. Instead, this minister chose to go to the cricket and let things rip. In just one example that we've turned to today—the Jeta Gardens aged-care facility south of Brisbane—at the time this minister was at the cricket COVID was ripping right through that aged-care facility, and we now see 15 residents dead, as well as dozens more testing positive. This minister must go and he must go today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis facing elderly Australians in our nursing homes is hardly new. For years now, since well before the royal commission into aged care, we've been hearing heartbreaking and harrowing stories from constituents about exactly what it's like for residents and workers in these facilities. Twenty-two reports and a royal commission on, however, and Australia's most vulnerable find themselves in the aged-care sector's deepest and most profound crisis yet, and we have a minister in charge who simply doesn't turn up and do the job that the aged-care sector need him to do. I've been getting constituent feedback, people reaching out, telling me exactly how difficult it is in aged care at the moment and how the response from government has been completely inadequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would have you believe that nobody could see this coming, that there was no way we could have protected people in residential aged care. That is simply not true. I accept that this crisis hasn't been made by COVID-19, because the structural weakness in aged care exists beyond that. For the last eight years—heading into their ninth year—the government have paid lip service to aged care. They have refused, following review after review, to do anything. Then, when it was reaching crisis point, this Prime Minister called a royal commission. In a way, it bought him another year not to fix the issues in aged care. Throughout those hearings we heard story after story about how the aged-care system wasn't able to deal with the pressures that exist. One of the fundamental issues is workforce—the fact that the government refuse to acknowledge that the aged-care workforce is undervalued and underpaid. They would rather point the finger at Labor, accuse us of spending more money than they do by supporting aged-care workers, than actually stump up and put a submission to the Fair Work Commission arguing for better wages for aged-care workers. It is simply not tenable to retain a professional workforce and pay them less than you would pay my teenager to work on the weekend. They do the caring in these facilities. They are the ones that provide the meals, that clean the rooms, that clean older Australians—and this government thinks it's completely acceptable for them to exist on $22 per hour, to do the work of angels and to be the heroes of this pandemic. That is one of the biggest pressures facing the aged-care system and one this government refuses to accept. It is one of the pressures that has caused the most challenges for elderly Australians living in aged care during the pandemic—because, the minute the workforce is out, the quality of care suffers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's what we've seen in thousands of aged-care facilities right around the country: as workers got sick, this government's response was to change the criteria for how long they had to isolate. It was: 'Oh well, get back to work sooner, once you've got rid of COVID if you could, because we really need you in the workplace.' It wasn't to deal comprehensively with the issues these workers or facing or the stress they feel when they can't provide the care to the people they look after. I've heard deeply distressing stories from workers who have worked 16-hour shifts and been unable to spend time with people who are lonely and isolated and scared. The nature of the workforce means it attracts extremely caring people. For that situation to be there every single day as they work extended shifts and double shifts and come back the next day after five hours sleep is deeply distressing to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is disingenuous when it says it is dealing with the issues. It is not dealing with the issues. The sector has been in crisis for years. It's in complete crisis now and the government doesn't have a long-term plan about how to address those challenges. As long as they keep their head in the sand about workforce and the pay rates for aged-care workers, nothing is going to improve at all. The people who pay that price are older Australians who rely on those services. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273828" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I guess we can't expect anything different as we enter into an election year. The politicking, the smears, the constant creation of fear by all those on the other side is set to continue and, most likely, escalate. The last 45 minutes has demonstrated what all Australians who want to see this place achieve things can see is going to happen over the next couple of months. Stunts, smears and fear—it's all they've got, it's all the other side have to offer Australia. Australians are looking to come out from under the doona. Australians want government to get out of their lives. They want their lives to go back to normal. Australians are desperately hoping that their businesses can start to function as normal, that their kids can go to school as normal. They are hoping that their job security, their social lives and everything that goes on around their kids and the sport that they play—the dance lessons, the rugby season, the cricket—all goes back to normal and parents can start to participate again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not over there—no, no, no. There is no way they want Australians going back to any sort of normal life. So today the fear campaign is centred around aged care. Aged care has always been an incredibly difficult area of public policy. It is a sad part of the Australian experience and the Australian community. When people enter aged-care facilities—in particular, high-need aged-care facilities—it is not because they're in a great state of health. They don't go into these sort of situations because they're entering the prime of their lives. They are not. It is absolutely at the sunset of their lives. That's why it's called 'the sunset time of life'. I know this because my mother's in an aged-care home and has been in a high-needs facility for four years. Because of the pandemic, I haven't been able to see her for over 12 months, because no-one is allowed in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of today, 100 per cent of aged-care facilities have been offered a booster clinic and have had a booster clinic. But one reason why some people haven't had a booster shot is that their health wasn't able to take it at that point in time, or they were on other medication and they were advised not to receive the booster shot. But never let the truth of a situation get in the way of a smear campaign from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do want Australian families to be together. We do want Australian families to be able to spend time with their loved ones in aged care. We do know that omicron is spread far more easily, but we also know that, when people got omicron, they showed very few symptoms, if any at all. In fact, the vast majority of people didn't even know they had it; they didn't even know they were positive with COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another problem that we've got with a lot of the state governments and their reporting. They're obsessed with how many daily cases of COVID there are. Then they start to talk about how many people are in hospital. Then they talk about the deaths from COVID. What they don't talk about is the fact that lots of women go into hospital every day to have a baby. When they go into hospital they're tested for COVID, and a remarkable number of them didn't even know they were COVID positive, but they are then counted in the numbers. We do, unfortunately, see people who have COVID die—and I know those opposite might have forgotten that, ultimately, every single one of us in here is going to die—but they may not have died from COVID. They could have died from cancer or from a gunshot wound to the stomach, but, if they had COVID, they're counted as a COVID death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just continuing to perpetuate the fear that those opposite want to see Australians live under, because you don't like small business and you don't like family-run business. You love a government handout. You love boosting your union mates, making sure you can pay them all as much as possible and shutting down any entrepreneurship or Australian spirit of having a go. You want everyone hiding under the doona. We know that because the world's longest lockdown in history was overseen by your mate Dan Andrews, Premier of Victoria. In terms of federal government responsibility, guess what we also saw last year? It was only in Victoria that we saw the mass outbreak of deaths. The largest number of deaths occurred in Victoria, but no way was this in relation to Victoria! It had nothing to do with Premier Andrews! He was probably too busy trying to deal with Adem Somyurek and what happened with the red shirts, making sure IBAC and the Victorian police never looked into anything. You lot opposite won't ever look into anything if it involves a Victorian premier or a Labor premier. Palaszczuk had Queensland locked off. We know Western Australia can't even handle—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I speak again today on one of the most serious issues that's confronting our country right now, which is the ongoing aged-care crisis that we see on the watch of Minister Colbeck and the Morrison government as a whole.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was saying earlier, this is not a new crisis that we have seen. The system has been in crisis for years, and it is a direct result of the cuts that Prime Minister Scott Morrison imposed on the aged-care sector when he was the Treasurer only a couple of years ago. Tragically, the chickens are coming home to roost from the decision to cut aged-care funding. We see every night on our nightly news programs the neglect, the ill-treatment, the staff shortages and the disgraceful situation which so many older Australians face each and every day. Of course, it has got worse following the COVID pandemic, following this government again dropping the ball and failing to take responsibility for an area that is 100 per cent their responsibility: being aged care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this Prime Minister and this minister do everything they possibly can to blame-shift—to blame other people, particularly state governments—whenever a problem arises. This is one that they can't blame on other people because the federal government is 100 per cent responsible for aged care. They are 100 per cent responsible for their failure to make sure that we have the aged-care workforce that we need as a country and to make sure that aged-care workers are paid a decent wage, so they are attracted to working in the sector and remain in the sector for years to come. It is 100 per cent this government's responsibility that they did not provide the PPE or the rapid antigen tests that aged-care facilities needed as we opened up as a country and as omicron raged across the country, particularly in aged-care facilities. Tragically, we see the result of this government's failure to do its job in aged care in the form of the 587 deaths that we have seen in aged-care facilities just since 1 January this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister's performance in question time today, I think, made clear why he is not the man for the job. He seems to be living on another planet when it comes to what's happening in aged care at the moment. He tells us on the one hand that we have had 587 deaths since 1 January, but he won't admit that this is a crisis, even when his own Prime Minister does so himself. Minister Colbeck chooses instead to reel off all sorts of statistics to assure us that the situation in aged care is not as bad as we all think it is. Well, hello? As I say, what planet is he living on? Does he seriously think that 587 deaths in aged care since 1 January this year is an acceptable result, especially when so many of those deaths arise from failures of this government to do its job, to get the PPE into aged-care facilities, to get aged-care residents boostered, to get masks and to get rapid antigen tests into aged-care facilities for residents and workers? That didn't happen, and we now see the consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We focused in question time on one particular example: the Jeta Gardens aged-care facility south of Brisbane. That is something I've been paying close attention to, as we've seen an outbreak rip through that aged-care facility and it has now cost the lives of 15 residents of that home. There are about 180 residents and staff in total at that one home who have tested positive for COVID. There are alarming reports that have surfaced today in the media in Queensland that there is a severe shortage of masks for staff. Even now at the end, as this outbreak has been going for over a month, we have reports in the media today that staff have been told to only change their masks if they need to, because there is such a shortage of masks there. We learnt from the minister today that booster shots didn't even start in this facility until 31 January, one month after the outbreak began—one month of people catching COVID and dying from COVID before booster shots even started. If that is not a great failure of responsibility from this federal government, I don't know what is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What possibly makes what we're seeing in the Jeta Gardens facility right now even worse is that this government knew that there was a problem. Just last year, the government's own aged-care regulator prepared two reports which said that this aged-care facility was non-compliant in meeting aged-care standards. It raised serious questions about the safety of residents. It raised serious concerns about the lack of a COVID outbreak management plan. But what happened? Again, this minister was asleep at the wheel, and we see the tragic consequences in 15 people dying. He has got to go. This government has got to go once and for all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McLACHLAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  Can I start my contribution to this debate by thanking the <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services</span>, Minister Colbeck, for his outstanding leadership in this difficult time in Australia and by pushing back on the arguments made by my honourable friend Senator Watt. From the outset of the pandemic, aged care has always been a key focus of this government, and it will remain so. The government fully accepts that it is distressing for families who have their members in aged care, particularly with the consequences of state laws or state directives preventing their loved ones from giving support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has been using rapid antigen tests in aged care since last August, having delivered 9.5 million, and there are further deliveries underway to all facilities. This is in addition to over 1.5 million PCR tests that have been conducted. From the National Medical Stockpile, 42.9 million masks, 15.7 million gowns, 43.7 million gloves, 12.5 million goggles and face shields, and 190,000 bottles of hand sanitiser have been provided to aged-care facilities. The Australian Defence Force is providing strategic logistical support to assist with the increased distributions to the aged-care sector. Supporting the aged-care workforce has always been a priority of this government, with more than 80,000 shifts having been filled by a surge workforce provided by this caring and well-led government, particularly under Minister Colbeck. One hundred per cent of facilities across the country have received a booster clinic. More than 76 per cent of eligible aged-care residents have received a booster, which is above the national booster rate by more than 20 per cent. These are startling statistics which demonstrate, brutally and clearly, the commitment of this government to support those in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, in his answer, made reference to the $18 billion which the government has committed to the aged-care sector following the royal commission. The government is supplying information to the Fair Work Commission to assist in its deliberations and has not yet been directed to clarify its position in relation to a wage increase. It is not fair to characterise the government as not committed to aged-care workers. The government will provide $210 million to support the aged-care workforce to continue to care for older Australians during the pandemic. A bonus of $800 will be made in two payments of up to $400 each and will be paid to aged-care workers in government subsidised home care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government took the courageous decision to instruct that a royal commission be established, and it has committed itself to the findings. The $18.3 billion committed is a once-in-a-generation change. No government before this one has committed any more into aged care. The government will be delivering record investment over the forward estimates. From $13.3 billion in 2012-13, this is such a significant amount and out-matches anything even conceptualised by the Labor government when last on the treasury bench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission, as referenced by the minister in his answer, made 148 recommendations. The vast majority have been accepted, and implementation is underway. The government's response includes a five-year implementation plan underpinned by five key pillars: home care, supporting Australians who choose to remain in their home; residential aged-care services and sustainability, improving and simplifying residential aged-care services and access; residential aged-care quality and safety, improving residential aged-care quality and safety; workforce, supporting a better skilled and growing workforce— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  In question time today, Senator Colbeck again failed to acknowledge that there is a crisis in aged care. He has failed to acknowledge that we are in a state of emergency in aged care today. He has failed in his most fundamental and basic duty, and that is to keep our most vulnerable elderly Australians safe. He has failed. He has failed and he should go. This minister has ignored report after report and warning after warning from experts for too long. He has ignored the calls for help from workers, from residents, from providers and from families for too long. He has simply ignored his responsibility as a minister for too long. Australians have waited far too long for the Prime Minister to sack this incompetent minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never forget that, as this crisis unfolded—when aged-care residents were locked in their rooms, when aged-care residents were going without food and going without water, when aged-care residents were going without basic care—this minister took himself off to the cricket for three days. For three days, he enjoyed the cricket while aged-care residents suffered. While aged-care workers worked back-to-back 14-hour shifts, this minister thought it was appropriate and acceptable to take himself off to the cricket not just for one day but for three days—right at the time when aged-care residents were going hungry, right at the time when aged-care residents were dying. It is a complete disgrace. This minister must go. He must resign, and if he won't the Prime Minister must sack him today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing I can agree with in Senator Colbeck's comments in question time today—it is that this is no longer a crisis, because we've gone past that; this is an absolute catastrophe. It is a full-blown catastrophe. It is not just a catastrophe that has occurred during the COVID pandemic; it is a catastrophe that has been nine years in the making. It's a catastrophe that aged-care workers have been warning us about for years. You only need to talk to those workers to know exactly what is going on in aged care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Senator Colbeck and the Prime Minister should have gone outside and spoken to the ANMF members who are here today to tell their stories. These are the workers who were trying, in the most difficult of conditions, to protect and keep safe our vulnerable aged-care residents—unlike Minister Colbeck and the Prime Minister. I listened to their stories today. I listened to what they've heard and seen over the past few months. They said that they are simply drowning. They said they've been underwater in aged care for a long time under this government, and today they are simply drowning. They were treading water last year; right now they're underwater and overwhelmed. There are no staff to fill the shifts that need to be filled. They are exhausted, burnt out and heartbroken, because on a day-to-day basis they are running between rooms trying to make decisions about who to help—whether to get someone off the floor or whether to go to a dementia patient who's in distress. These are the decisions that are facing aged-care workers today because the minister will not do his job, because he can't make the right decisions to keep our aged-care workers and our aged-care residents safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aged-care workers are making heartbreaking decisions. What they want is time. They just want the staff. They just want to be there for people. They want to hold their hands in their last moments, to listen to their stories, to give them the care and dignity they deserve. Instead, people are being locked in their rooms, isolated, lonely and distraught, because of the failures of this minister and this government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-five of the people sitting in parliament today own investment homes up here. Of those, 33 are Labor politicians and 42 are coalition politicians. It's a scam. The public is paying nearly $2 million a year for politicians to sleep in their own beds. It has to stop. It happens on the quiet; nobody ever talks about it. It's: 'Don't ask, Don't tell. Don't worry.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians are quietly squeezing free money out of taxpayers to line their own pockets, thanks to loopholes in the travel allowance rules in Canberra. When politicians have to travel for work, they have to stay in a hotel or a motel and they're paid a travel allowance to cover their room and their food. You only pay this if you're staying in commercial accommodation. If you're staying with a mate, you're not paying for a place to stay, so you shouldn't get travel allowance. Pretty straightforward, hey? Well, that's not how it works here in Canberra—oh no! In Canberra you get paid nearly $300 a night to stay wherever you like, and you get it tax free. It doesn't matter if you're sleeping at a hostel or the Hyatt; you get $300 a night from the taxpayer. They say Canberra is a bubble, and they might be right, because there's only one place in the country where you can charge everybody else to sleep in your own home. It doesn't matter if you sleep in a hotel or if you stay at your mate's place. It doesn't even matter if you stay in your very own apartment. You can sleep in the comfort of your own bed and you still get the same amount, nearly 300 bucks, every night when you're in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This rule, as I've said, only applies in Canberra. How convenient! Nowhere else in the country do we pay politicians to have a mortgage—nowhere! Seventy-five politicians are charging you people out there over $20,000 tonight alone. All that money goes straight into their own pockets, not to mention the money they make out of it once they sell that housing property when they finish here. They buy a unit, leave it empty for half the year and then come to Canberra for sittings and charge us all to cover their mortgage. They make more than $1,000 every sitting week, tax free, tucked up in their pyjamas, and that's not including if they stay the weekend and don't go home!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are Australians out there who can't even afford to pay their rent each week, let alone buy their first home, and we've got pollies giving themselves taxpayers' money to pay for their second one. Taxpayers are footing the bill for their mortgage, but the pollies keep the profits at the end. It is wrong. It is a rort. There is no reason for regular Australians to be paying for wealthy politicians to own investment properties in Canberra. Or, should I say, there's at least no good reason for that, because clearly there are 300 reasons—one for every one of the politicians, Liberal and Labor, who are happily jumping through the loophole to stay in their fancy Canberra flats this evening. They don't want to tell you that, though; they'll never admit that. Ask any politician up here why they should get nearly 300 bucks to sleep in their own home and they get pretty sheepish about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you: look at Minister Birmingham this afternoon, and look at the opposition leader, who, last week, must have been pretty embarrassed to say he won't do anything to fix this rort—maybe because he knows he'll get caught out for raking in tens of thousands of dollars as well. What do they say when you ask them about it? This is what their excuse is: 'It's within the rules.' So what? Just because you can doesn't mean you should. The rules let you rip off taxpayers—so you're okay with that? I don't care about what the rules say, because, if the rules allow widescale rorting, the rules are wrong. The rules are a bad example. Go and ask anyone in your electorate. It doesn't pass the pub test. It honestly takes my breath away that anyone would have the stomach to sell themselves out for extra cash on taxpayers' dime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The money isn't even the worst bit though; it's the attitude. Kickbacks to politicians happen because the Liberal and Labor parties write the rules for themselves. The government acts like taxpayer money is fair game for politicians to rort, and there is no opposition, because they're in on it too. Both of them have their snouts in the trough! What's new?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public money is for the public; it's not for your mortgage. It's money that's supposed to be going to aged-care workers, rapid antigen tests and homes for people who can't afford them. These parties have ripped off taxpayers for so long it's like they can't see the problem anymore. But they're defending the indefensible and they know it. They have to stop thinking it's okay to write their own rules in a way that suits them, because Australians aren't going to put up with it for much longer. For goodness sake, find your conscience and fix it!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we take the opportunity to reflect on the life and lasting contributions of former senator Dr Don Grimes. We remember Don Grimes as a man of great compassion and decency whose legacy endures through the social policy reforms that he advanced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born on 4 October 1937 in Albury, New South Wales, Donald James Grimes was son to Walter and Nancy Grimes. His father worked as a fitter and turner with New South Wales Railways, and his mother worked as a nurse. I'm not too sure how many of us in the chamber today would have been all that familiar with <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> at an early age. Nevertheless, in reflecting today on Don's upbringing, it's interesting to note that, despite a lack of books in his home, one of the few publications in the Grimes household—how I'm not quite clear—was apparently <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, of which Don was an avid reader. It was the first instance of a political thread that was to continue to weave itself through Don's journey through and beyond his service in public office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through his schooling at Fort Street High School and thereafter, Don was remembered as an exceptional sportsman who excelled in athletics, Rugby Union, Aussie Rules football and water polo. After matriculating in 1954, Don studied medicine at the University of Sydney, completing his clinical training at the Royal North Shore Hospital. Of note is that one of Don's lecturers during his medical training at the University of Sydney was a future colleague of his from across the aisle, Senator Peter Baume.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through his work in regional Tasmania, Don observed the debilitating effects of poverty, domestic violence and illegal abortions, which would influence his approach to social policy. His work took him and his young family to the UK in 1965. Here his political views were consolidated by the experiences he had, which included joining the British Labour Party. Upon his return home to Australia in 1966, Don Grimes's political interest was piqued further by the challenges posed in Australia at that time by the Vietnam War, and in 1968 he made the life-altering decision to join the Australian Labor Party. Six years later, Don's active involvement in the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party culminated in his election to the Australian Senate in 1974, just ahead of the tumult that was to occur in the Senate one year later. In his maiden speech to the Senate, Donald Grimes outlined his noble vision of an Australian future where:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… people should have the freedom and the opportunity to realise their reasonable ambitions without being exploited by others or indeed without exploiting others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don Grimes quickly ascended to the position of leadership on the opposition front bench in January 1976, having been elected by the federal Labor caucus to serve as the shadow minister for social security. Grimes fostered strong relationships and a broad dialogue with interest groups and stakeholders in his portfolio right across the nation. In this way, he helped to craft the Labor Party's social security election platforms and cemented himself as an increasingly influential figure within the then modern-day Labor Party. He indeed helped to transform Labor's platform and policies to return the party to being an electable alternative following the crushing defeats of the Whitlam government, and in the 1977 election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Administratively, Don Grimes also stepped up to serve as president of the then troubled Tasmanian branch of the ALP; when his party called upon him, holding multiple leadership roles, he helped to lead Labor back to government. Following Labor's election victory in March 1983, Donald Grimes was appointed Minister for Social Security in the Hawke government. He was an active minister—indeed, an activist minister. Through his time as minister, perhaps no achievement stands out more than the enactment of the Disability Services Act of 1986. The act enjoyed bipartisan support, reflective of widespread consultation that Don Grimes had undertaken. It provided linking government funding to organisations for specified outcomes for clients, providing recognition and dignity to people with disabilities. As those of us serving in this place through recent years reflect upon modern-day reforms such as the NDIS, we see that the first steps for real support by a Commonwealth government in disability services were taken very much during that era and under the leadership of Don Grimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don Grimes was a true Labor believer, a true believer in the philosophies that underpin the Labor movement. During his time in government, he pursued a better and more equitable Australia. He also was there for some great challenges. Former Labor health minister Neal Blewett, a cabinet colleague of Don's, considered Grimes very much the architect of Labor's social reform agenda, and together Neal Blewett and Don Grimes are remembered for the work that they undertook in combatting the terrifying AIDS epidemic in Australia in the 1980s. The public health response to the AIDS crisis has long been lauded as one of the most effective in Australia, and that undertaken by the likes of Neal Blewett and Don Grimes at that time in Australia was recognised as one of the most effective in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His advocacy in this space continued long after his service in the Australian parliament. Don Grimes also controversially was the architect of the reinstatement of the assets test on the age pension in Australia. In doing so, he took a difficult policy platform. He argued the case for the age pension to be applied in a manner that was truly needs based and to be reflective of the need for sustainability in the provision of such social services spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it was that pursuit of sustainability that was also reflected in some of his less-successful attempts at policy reform. Don Grimes argued strongly for tax reform in Australia and for the Labor Party to pursue an enhancement of tax revenue raising, particularly through the pursuit of indirect taxes—the type of tax reform that would take some decades until it was enacted with the GST at a later stage. But he did so, arguing quite transparently that if the left of the Labor Party—as he thought was appropriate—were to pursue a bigger welfare state and a greater role for government then it needed to be appropriately and fairly funded and that such indirect tax measures were a way to do so. He was true to himself, applying principles based, again, on the need for sustainability in budget and in welfare spending. But, unfortunately, at that time, he was unsuccessful in persuading his party to hold the line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don Grimes would leave parliament in 1987, following a number of health complications. From 1987 to 1991, Grimes served as Australian Ambassador to the Netherlands, having built strong relations through international socialist movements, particularly across European nations. During his service in the Netherlands, he again took on roles combatting AIDS and, in particular, leading parts of the World Health Organization response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in particular one of Don Grimes's comments, made to a journalist in 1988, reflecting his view of Australia from afar. And, indeed, it is also reflective of Don Grimes's commitment to innovative, ambitious policy reform. From that overseas perspective, he said, 'In Australia there is a healthy suspicion of the new, but, sometimes, a pathological suspicion. Politicians there, including me at times, have been reluctant to try new programs in case they don't work. Unless you accept that when you try new approaches some will fail, then you will never get anywhere. There's an unfortunate corollary that when people do try new programs which fail they are reluctant to admit they have failed.' It's an insight that's well worth all of us recalling, even some decades later. As we navigate the challenges of coronavirus, rapid technological change and globalisation, and the strategic challenges within our region, it's important to remember the need for policy innovation, the need for policy ambition, the need to be willing to fail and the need to acknowledge failure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don's insights remain as pertinent today as they were 30 years ago. In recognition of his services to the Australian parliament and to international relations, Don was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1992. Mr President, we can and should all draw strength and encouragement from Don's posture towards the challenges of his time. His pursuit of policy with principle and purpose earned him respect and praise across factional boundaries, across party boundaries and across politics generally. He wasn't always successful, but he made real, meaningful, lasting and beneficial reforms to our nation. I know firsthand, from speaking to those who knew Don Grimes, even some of those who worked for Don Grimes, that he was admired, respected and loved by many. On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate, I extend our sincerest condolences to Don's family and our thanks for his service to the nation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Busines</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">s in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Labor Party and the opposition to contribute to the condolence motion in honour of former senator Donald James Grimes, a former minister in the Hawke government and a proud public servant in this place. It's important that we take this time to reflect on Senator Grimes and the many significant, indelible contributions he made to our nation. He was a man of immense drive, pragmatism and integrity who was determined to correct injustice and inequality wherever he saw it. He would play a crucial role in the development and implementation of one of the most significant public policies in our nation's history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The seeds of that success can be found in his childhood, where a lifelong commitment to social justice was forged. Senator Grimes was born in Albury, New South Wales, in 1937. With his mother dying at an early age, Don grew up in a single-parent, working-class family. His father, a fitter and turner with New South Wales railways, became a significant influence on Don and helped to shape his world view, one dominated by a sense of egalitarianism. Another aspect of his childhood would also have a profound effect on the young Don Grimes and begin a true love for the business of this place. There was a lack of books in the family home, but one of the few publications available was the parliament's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate said in his remarks. Don was an avid reader, and his passion for politics and the issues of the day flourished from the records of debate in this great chamber. It served as a tremendous foreshadowing: his enlightening and impassioned speeches would go on to be transcribed in newer editions of his old favourite book.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, Senator Grimes is remembered for his contributions which sought to amplify the voices of minority groups and shine a light on issues which were often overlooked. These contributions were often informed by Senator Grimes's early career in the field of medicine, one that exposed him to many stories too often ignored. Senator Grimes undertook his clinical training at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, followed by an internship at Royal Hobart Hospital and a stint in London. This whirlwind tour as a young GP showed Senator Grimes the contradictions of our society. His time at Royal Hobart Hospital contrasted starkly with his time at North Shore. In Hobart, he encountered patients far less fortunate than those he'd treated in Sydney. The Royal Hobart gave him a front-row seat to the devastating effects of poverty, domestic violence and illegal abortions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, in London, he became acutely aware of the separation of classes in the United Kingdom, an awareness that inspired him to join the British Labour Party. This gave him exposure to the workings of European social democracies and helped him envisage a fairer and more equal Australia. These experiences had a profound impact on Senator Grimes, and he would later return to Tasmania and join the Australian Labor Party in the late 1960s, in part inspired by activism surrounding the ongoing Vietnam War. It would be the start of a political career which would culminate in his 13-year tenure as a senator for Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he came to this place, it was only fitting that one of the main priorities that he set out in his first speech was health care—specifically, the need for a national health insurance scheme. It was off-the-cuff—not just his commitment to health care but his entire speech. He had had little notice, less than 24 hours, to prepare his remarks, and even those hastily prepared notes were taken away from him by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, who said that Grimes would perform far better on his feet. He was right. The new senator used his pulpit to decry the resistance by conservatives to change and reform, saying that it was a response to be expected from those of advantage and privilege. Senator Grimes concluded by saying, 'People should have the freedom and the opportunity to realise their reasonable ambitions without being exploited by others or indeed without exploiting others.' It was an impassioned start by a senator who would fight throughout his career for justice and equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In only his first few months as a senator, Don bravely and passionately participated in the debates over the Whitlam government's two Medibank bills: the Health Insurance Bill and the Health Insurance Commission Bill. Using his experience as a general practitioner, he challenged arguments that the bills amounted to communism, conscription and fascism, and asserted that health care was a core element of social security and thus should be funded by progressive taxation. He continued this fight for a universal healthcare system throughout the entirety of his career. Eventually, as Minister for Social Security and, later, Minister for Community Services under Prime Minister Hawke, he would see the program come to life under the name we now know it as: Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few public institutions more beloved in this nation than Medicare. Our public healthcare system is the envy of many in the world, and it stands as one of the greatest public policy achievements by an Australian government in our history. It took a number of tremendous individuals to create Medicare, and Senator Grimes was one of the very best. We owe him a great deal. His finest hour is now a right enjoyed by all Australians, and there is no more fitting legacy for a person like Don than the little green card in our wallets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Grimes was a passionate advocate for many other issues, and he was always more than willing to speak up on divisive topics and raise the voices of minorities in this country. Senator Grimes was instrumental in the Hawke government's effective and informed response to the AIDS crisis during the early 1980s. He answered the first question to parliament on AIDS, in May 1983, and advocated in the cabinet that the issue justified a fast, science based policy response free from politics. Given the stigma around the issue at the time, this further demonstrated the high premium he placed on the dignity of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This trait was also shown in Senator Grimes's tireless work in the disability sector. In 1983, Don established the Disability Advisory Council of Australia. The council allowed people with a disability to do what he had been doing for them for so many years. He provided an avenue for people with a disability to directly advise the government on policies which affected their lives and their community. Perhaps his most significant achievement, alongside Medicare, in this space was the enactment of the Disability Services Act of 1986. By challenging the long-held views of professionals and peak bodies, he was able to advocate for a system which linked government funding to specific goals for clients who had a disability. In doing so, he believed he had given people with a disability 'a proper recognition of their rights and dignity and opportunity for the fullest possible participation in the community'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given his passionate advocacy across a range of controversial issues, you might imagine that Senator Grimes would have had many detractors in this place. But, in fact, it was quite the opposite. It speaks volumes of his character that Don was well liked by many of his colleagues right across the chamber. Senator Michael Tate dubbed him 'the quiet revolutionary' for his contribution to social policy, and his cabinet colleague Neal Blewett considered Senator Grimes to be the architect of much of Labor's social reform agenda. Senator Rosemary Crowley said that he was numbered amongst 'the very strong feminists' of her acquaintances, while Senator Susan Ryan acknowledged his 'enormously effective new programs' for the disadvantaged and the provision of 40,000 new childcare places, stating: 'He has done all of those things without great fuss, without pomposity or high-flown rhetoric. He is kind, decent, humane.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After politics, Senator Grimes's sense of community and his willingness to stand up and speak for the disadvantaged took him all over the world, where he continued to advocate for change for all. He would serve as an ambassador to the Netherlands and chair a World Health Organization committee on AIDS in prisons. He would also serve on the Australian National Council on AIDS, work as a director of oncology in Kuala Lumpur and serve as a principal adviser to the health minister of Bahrain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a life well lived, and one thoroughly decent and of great service to our nation. It was all part of his central ethos, a sentiment best summed up by this quote from his valedictory speech. Senator Don Grimes said that we should always strive for a 'more loving and caring society'. This is a core tenet of the philosophy of our party, and we seek to carry on Don's work and his legacy in this chamber today. My thoughts are with Senator Grimes's children, Roger, Jan, Jenny, Sally and Ben. I hope they are tremendously proud of their father's accomplishments, as we in this chamber are today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">tor CAROL BROWN</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I would also like to express my condolences, and those of Tasmanian Labor, on the passing of former senator the Hon. Don Grimes. It is with sadness that we see the passing of a giant of the Labor Party. Don's contribution to the nation, and to Labor, was significant. His list of achievements in the service of Australia, Tasmania and his people is immense, ranging from grassroots involvement to the highest echelons of government—a local GP, a senator for Tasmania, a federal minister and an Australian ambassador. He was a leader on disability, women's refuge, Australia's response to HIV, and community and aged-care services. Don's contribution, and his legacy, has had long-lasting significance. He served as Minister for Social Security and Minister for Community Services in the Hawke government, as well as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. Don was a much-loved and well-known GP prior to entering politics, and his kindness and wit were appreciated by all who came across him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of knowing Don Grimes. I first met Don in 1983 as a Young Labor member. He was larger than life. His reputation for genuine caring and being a generous man was always on display and was well earned. Not once did I hear him personally denigrate an individual to make a political point. He was a brilliant representative of his adopted state of Tasmania in the Senate and in government. Don didn't shy away from the challenges or a policy fight. He had an enviable reputation for pushing through and getting results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don moved to Tasmania in 1966 and made Launceston his home. He took on various medical roles, including providing general practice service in Launceston. It was here that Don joined the Australian Labor Party, acting on his disapproval for the Vietnam War and his support for Medibank. By 1974, he was representing Tasmania as a Labor senator. Legend has it that he worked on his first speech in the Senate the night before he was due to deliver it. He rose to begin his address when the then senator Lionel Murphy took the draft and told Don that he would perform better thinking on his feet. My dear friend former senator Alex Gallacher would have indeed approved of this action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don's passion for politics, public policy and equality were well known and widely regarded and never wavered. As many will recall, he was a great Minister for Social Security in the Hawke government. It was during this time that Don pioneered the first-ever federal Disability Advisory Council. He also established—and I note the language of the day—the Handicapped Programs Review, which was to examine the impact of social policies and procedures on people with disability. This was the first time that people with disability had been invited into the federal policymaking process. As a result of this review, the Disability Services Act 1986 was born. At the heart of the review and legislation was the principle that future government funds should be directed towards services and programs that provide people with disability the greatest amount of flexibility possible. Although the language of the day was clumsy, Don's recognition of the need for flexibility in directing funding towards disability services and supports was ahead of its time. In many respects, his long overdue recognition of the needs of people with disability at a federal level was the beginning of the journey towards the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don's experience in medicine and his passion for inclusion and equality also meant that he played a leading role in the Hawke government's effective and enlightened approach towards recognising and combating AIDS and supporting those with the virus. Again, as Senator Gallagher indicated, Don was adamant that any government action and policy should be science based. And, again, he was ahead of his time. Don would later go on to serve as the first-ever federal Minister for Community Services. During his time in this role, one of the most significant achievements was the funding of an additional 40,000 childcare places. To provide some perspective on how important this commitment was, it is equivalent to roughly one million additional places today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of his colleagues at the time, another great Labor minister, former senator Susan Ryan, described Don's many social policy achievement as 'enormously effective new programs'. She went on to say: 'He has done all those things without great fuss, without pomposity or high-flown rhetoric. He's kind, decent and humane.' His contribution to the fight against AIDS was recognised while he was serving overseas as Australia's Ambassador to the Netherlands, when he was appointed as chair of the World Health Organization committee on AIDS in prisons. On returning to Australia, he continued his work and advocacy in this area by chairing the Australian National Council on AIDS from 1992 until 1996.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Don announced his retirement from the Senate due to health reasons, he left an important departing message, calling on politicians and the wider community to develop a more loving and caring society. In making this call, Don urged people to reflect on what happens in times of national tragedy and disaster, when we see how members of our society come together and use their skills and resources to help one another, particularly those in difficulty. We have all witnessed many modern-day examples of this during the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don was loved and admired by many in Tasmania and throughout the Labor Party and the Labor movement. He was respected in the federal parliament, with friendships extending across party lines. His extensive involvement with public health administration was recognised by his appointments as a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators and as a Fellow of the Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine.

Supporting Don's honour were Michelle O'Byrne MP, the honourable member for Bass, and his longstanding good friend Anne O'Byrne. Both spoke strongly of Don's achievements and contribution, and fondly and warmly of the man as a good friend, a wit, a true believer and a true Labor man—there is no higher accolade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning back to January 1952, after a Christmas spent in England a young Princess Elizabeth—just 25 years old—had set out with the Duke of Edinburgh for a tour that would include Australia and New Zealand. The young princess and her family had been buoyed by the apparent resurgence in the King's health. Hence it was with enormous shock that, en route to Australia, in Sigana, Kenya, Princess Elizabeth received the sad news of the King's death on 6 February 1952. The life of the then-Princess Elizabeth was turned upside down as she became Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the Commonwealth. As we look back on those early days of 1952, we find a time when Sir Robert Menzies was only a touch over two years into what would be his record-breaking postwar prime ministership. Very few of today's current parliamentarians were even born at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a broadcast following the Queen's coronation in 1953, Her Majesty reflected on the events of the day, remarking:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strived she has, throughout all her life, and a very unique trust she has earned in Australia and around large parts of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her Majesty has been the reigning sovereign for 15 Australian prime ministers and 16 governors-general, pointing to the natural change that has occurred during her reign. Change—there has certainly been a lot of it over the last 70 years. What hasn't changed is the steadfast example the world has come to expect from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Around her there has been much progress, enormous societal change, significant geopolitical change, wars, issues and challenges—many to navigate. Today we see that as much as ever. In these difficult times and throughout difficult times it has become a custom for people across the Commonwealth and beyond to look to the Queen, with confidence that she will project herself a confidence and understanding, a steadfastness, that provides some degree of reassurance at those times of challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020 the Queen's wisdom continued to be a light and comfort in a time of sorrow, as it always has. As the world grappled with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Her Majesty remarked in a broadcast to the UK on 5 April 2020:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed—and that success will belong to every one of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At that time Her Majesty demonstrated a confidence and optimism that was reassuring, and, through that, provided the pathway ahead for the peoples of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and, of course, for people throughout the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen has, across her 70-year-long reign, remained a constant—a stabling presence in the ongoing story of our nation here in Australia and of the Commonwealth. Since her ascension to the throne, as a consequence of the way in which she has carried out her duties Australians have developed a respect and affection for the Queen that is rivalled by few, if any. There is no shortage of qualities in Her Majesty that I'm sure many could point to that have been a source of this adoration. Regardless of one's politics, regardless of one's views around constitutional structures or arrangements, the Queen's grace, compassion, diligence and dignity come to mind for many, to name just a few such qualities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her Majesty has indeed earned the trust and admiration of so many of the Australian people. As this year of her Platinum Jubilee progresses, Australians will have the opportunity to participate in the celebrations to mark her service. In step with these celebrations I encourage all Australians to take the opportunity to reflect on the period of service by Her Majesty, and, as I'm sure she would wish, to reflect upon their own lives as to how they too can give more in service in honour of Her Majesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this anniversary I extend the gratitude of the Australian Senate for seven decades of unwavering public service and extend our warm wishes, congratulations and thanks to Her Majesty.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  Today the Senate recognises a remarkable milestone, the Platinum Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Today is a landmark, the complete meaning of which is difficult to fully encapsulate in this place. It is something that has rarely been achieved by any monarch in world history. It is through a combination of circumstances that we celebrate the long reign of Australia's sovereign. Were it not for the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII, and then the premature death at the age of just 56 of her father, King George VI, the Queen would never have ascended to the throne at such a young age on 6 February in 1952. Now we observe 70 years since that occasion—the Platinum Jubilee.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was nearly five years earlier on the occasion of her 21st birthday that the then Princess Elizabeth spoke to all the people of the Commonwealth from South Africa, and in doing so she made this solemn pledge:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While now times have changed and we may no longer talk about the 'great imperial family', there can be no doubt that Her Majesty has fulfilled her commitment over her long life. We know that during the course of her reign much has changed—the Empire has now become the Commonwealth and many nations, over which Britain was once the colonial ruler or for which the Queen was head of state, have become independent republics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some of us, we would like to see a change in the head of state here in Australia, but this does not in any way diminish the recognition we give the Queen today for our appreciation of her life of duty, her role in Australia and in the family of the Commonwealth. Today, we join together in that community of nations that we now know as the Commonwealth as we pay tribute to Her Majesty for the extreme dedication with which she has served. When she made that very famous speech in South Africa, Princess Elizabeth spoke of her aspiration that the Commonwealth would grow to be 'more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful influence for good in the world'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth remembering that the Senate and the House of Representatives do not stand alone in our parliamentary system of government. Our own Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span> advises us that parliament is 'a collective entity' consisting of the Senate, the House of Representatives and the monarch. So, in making this address today, we are also recognising the direct connection we have to the sovereign through our position as elected representatives in Australia's system of government here in the Australian Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We particularly acknowledge today the way in which Her Majesty has maintained her engagement with our country, especially through her visits, perhaps most famously in 1954, when she became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia but also on many other occasions such as when she opened this parliament house in 1998 and, through my own personal anecdotes, her visit to Western Australia in 1979—150 years since colonialisation—and, indeed, CHOGM, in Western Australia as well. We've seen, as a nation, her humanity, standing with us in our own times of hardship even as she has endured her own. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, said earlier today: 'It is possible that we can be a republican nation and still have the deepest respect for the Queen.' The Queen has done her duty. She has done her duty with vitality, integrity, humanity and even with the slightest sense of humour coming through at times as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition joins today with the government and other senators to express our sincere congratulations to the Queen on her Platinum Jubilee. We extend our very warmest regards on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  The British monarchy is a racist, colonial institution. It is a relic of the British Empire, and it shouldn't exist. But, sadly, here we are in this chamber discussing a motion to congratulate yet another monarch on whatever anniversary it is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a moment in history when millions of people are marching to make black lives matter. Statues of slave owners are being torn down, and attempts to decolonise the systems are gathering pace. But these motions serve as a painful reminder to people of colour like me, who migrated here from a place that was colonised, ravaged and looted by this very British Empire. It is another of too many brutal reminders to First Nations people here in this country who live, to this day, in colonial Australia that not only is colonialism is alive and well but that its institutions are still celebrated and cherished here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The British Crown sits on massive amounts of wealth that are the direct result of the theft of resources from colonised territories, the slave trade and occupation. The imperial colonisers ruthlessly extracted natural resources from the colonised countries to fill their coffers and feed their power and greed. This extractive, capitalist relationship is always predicated on taking more and more. In South Asia, where I come from, it was primarily the taking of resources; in Australia, it was the bloody possession of land and culture. Colonialism is not something of the past—something that is no longer relevant. The deep depravity of what was wrought may never be repaired. In many ways, colonialism has been merely transformed into the extractive and exploitative global corporations that control vast swathes of the world. You just have to look at the unabated extraction of coal and gas from sovereign land in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing to celebrate here. The terrible legacies of colonial rule here and everywhere cannot be ignored. Almost all the territories occupied by British colonialists suffer to this day from underdevelopment, corruption, malnutrition, hunger and conflict introduced by the coloniser. I think of places like Palestine and Kashmir, where British colonialists created arbitrary borders and where to this day there is immense suffering. Generations of Kashmiris and Palestinians have grown up without the most basic of human rights: to live and to live in peace. They have known nothing but the conflict introduced by the British. There is nothing to celebrate here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: motions congratulating the British royals moved in parliaments like ours are a celebration of centuries of systemic racism and exploitation by the British Empire. I, for one, will not stand for it. There is nothing to celebrate here.</span>

                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilien</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ce, Minister for Regionalisation, Regional Communications and Regional Education and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I stand here very, very proudly as the Leader of the National Party in the Senate to congratulate Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on achieving such an extraordinary milestone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often talk about women in leadership. This particular woman has led her nation, the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth for 70 years. She's seen tumultuous times and she's seen extraordinary change over that period—culturally, structurally and economically. What a fabulous example she is of how to do it right! The sixth of February marked 70 years since Her Majesty acceded to the throne at the age of 25 following the death of her father, King George VI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our party, the Nationals, proudly recognises constitutional monarchy as a stable and strong foundation for liberal democracies such as ours. We're very proud to celebrate the values shared with the UK and the monarchy: faith, family and freedom. It is those three values which the constitutional monarchy of the British throne and the Commonwealth more broadly have sought to prosecute, particularly under Her Majesty's rule. She's spent an incredible 73 per cent of her life on the throne and, in 2015, surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the longest-reigning monarch in British history. No-one even questions that she happens also to be a woman. It's an extraordinary achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since ascending to the throne in 1952, Her Majesty has presided over a period of immense social, economic and political transformation both in Australia and across the Commonwealth. Throughout, the Queen has been a constant presence, a constant source of institutional stability—a rock. In fact, for over half of our history as a federation, the Queen has been our monarch, and this means that most Australians have known no other sovereign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my great personal privilege to meet Her Majesty when she last visited Australia, when the Labor Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, introduced me to Her Majesty here in Parliament House. I was able to take my mother, who, as a very young girl, had waved Australian flags on the side of the road in Melbourne at the 1954 visit of Her Majesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen has seen 15 prime ministers here in Australia, and there have been 12 National Party leaders during her reign. Over the past seven decades, Her Majesty has cultivated enduring ties with Australians, being the first reigning monarch to visit Australia in 1954. Her Majesty has undertaken 16 official tours of our nation, marking important milestones, anniversaries or celebrations of Australian culture and history, including the opening of Parliament House in 1988. So strong is her tie to this nation that she chose to send the future king to school here for a period of time. That was not an accidental occurrence; it was a deliberate decision by Her Majesty to make sure that the future monarch, Prince Charles, would have a very deep and real understanding of who we are as a country and how different we are from the UK at some levels. Those ties have gone through other family members as well. She's travelled across the vast expanse of our country, meeting countless Australians of all cultures and walks of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like us in the National Party, the Queen has a deep love for and affiliation with rural life and all that it entails. She's a keen horsewoman and backs the racing industry as you wouldn't believe. I hear the Greens complaining, but what a fabulous industry! She's got some great bloodlines going. She spends every summer at her rural estate in Balmoral in the Highlands of Scotland. She's a farmer, and she's also a shooter. On any measure of rural living, that's the trifecta, and I'm very proud that she has so many affinities with rural and regional Australia on those particular issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Her Majesty has always expressed her admiration for Australians' resilience and their 'stoic and determined spirit' in the face of extreme weather, droughts, floods and bushfires. It's best exemplified by her sending members of the royal family at our time of need to lift the spirits of those Australians, particularly in rural and regional areas, going through these natural disasters but also by her donation to drought relief for the heart and soul of Australia in 2018, when we were going through those horrific events. Thank you, Your Majesty, for that—thinking of us at that time of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's fair to say that across Australia there is a deep respect and admiration for our Queen: for her wisdom, her kindness and her sense of duty<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> I love that her publicly published correspondence says: 'in your service'. I think her sense of duty and her complete commitment to living a life of service, in humility and through tough times, is again an example for us all<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> I'll finish with this quote from Her Majesty:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When life seems hard, the courageous do not lie down and accept defeat; instead, they are all the more determined to struggle for a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That, I believe, provides a clear insight into our Queen, both as a person and as a monarch. On behalf of the Nationals in the Senate, we sincerely thank Her Majesty for leading by example, for her unfailing service, for her dedication and for the unshakable sense of duty that our Queen has shown for Australia and for the Commonwealth over the past 70 years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  The British monarchy is a racist institution that is founded upon the principle of white supremacy and which exists today in the modern world as a relic of a time when, nakedly and without question, white people bestrode the earth claiming all before them to be theirs and, in the name of that sentiment, in that belief, brought death and destruction upon so many peoples of the earth. In the 21st century, it is the cold, hard reality that this mentality lives to this very day. We need only look to the colonial attitudes of the nation states of Europe, of the United States and, indeed, of Australia in relation to our own region, or to the white people of this nation in relation to First Nations people, to see the continuing existence of white supremacy in this world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an edifice that must be challenged and torn down. That great work, in which so many are now engaged, is hindered by the continual perpetuation of the myth, of the banality, of the British Empire. The British Empire was a cruel and extractive capitalist exercise which took the lives of millions across the world. The hollowed out, irrelevant edifice of the British monarchy which now stands in its place, looming over the continuing so-called Commonwealth, is the inheritor of that bloody legacy. We cannot and should not talk of it in this place without placing it in its context. To do so is to excuse and perpetuate its crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sit here as a proud member of the Australian Greens, a party avowedly committed to the establishment of Australia as a nation under treaty with its First Nations people. If, as part of that process of treaty, of truth-telling, of justice, it decides to take its place alongside the nations of the world that've cast off the moniker of monarchy and proclaimed themselves a republic, then that is what we believe that this country should be. One of the very many reasons that I believe that that is a course that we should take is that I am a democrat. I believe in democracy and that core democratic tenet that power is only legitimate when it is derived from the willing consent of the people over which that power is exercised. The reality of the British monarchy is that its power, in the absence of treaty, is illegitimate on this soil and has never been established according to key democratic principles. Sovereignty has never been ceded, and so it is the cruellest of jokes that this place would waste its valuable time uttering a sentence in relation to a foreign sovereign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I'll say on this issue is as a young person. To young people, the British monarchy exists as a strange combination of two things. Firstly, it's as a strange, continually present reminder of that poison of imperialism which is so deeply imbibed into the heart of this country, a kind of soft sinew back to the deep-seated racism, the very beginning of the proposition of the continent of Australia, of that assertion of terra nullius, that assertion of superiority and the idea that there was a dirt here that needed cleansing. Simultaneously it exists to us as young people—the vast majority of us—as a bit of a joke, as an irrelevant edifice kept alive by the sycophantic expressions of journalists that have lost all rudder in their careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many contributions in relation to the monarchy take the form of individuals that feel they have a personal connection to the monarchy and to the institution when nothing could be further from the truth. The reality of the British monarchy of the 21st century is that it is divided. It is, in many parts of the world, a disgraced institution. When it comes to certain members of that monarchy at the current time, it is on trial for crime. And so there is very little willingness in any part of our community to engage with it as anything more or less than a historical irrelevancy that should be cast off and done away with as part of a process of this country coming to terms with the truth of our history. Rather than hiding in the crevices of the past we should be embracing the wisdom and lived experience of the oldest continual civilisation on this earth, the oldest continuing culture. Embracing that wisdom, that knowledge and that holistic, inclusive conception of sovereignty is what we must do in this moment. We must join the nations of the world, like Barbados and so many others, that have finally, after all these years, stepped forward into themselves and stopped hiding behind an old idea that is grounded in immorality and a set of values that have no place in a modern Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's On</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">e Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  [by video link] I rise to acknowledge Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne of England. Whatever you might think of monarchies, the Queen is admired throughout the Commonwealth and around the world. She has been a beacon of stability and tradition at a time of unprecedented change. When she was born in 1926, she was fourth in the line of succession and it was not believed she would ever be Queen. Her uncle Edward's decision to abdicate in 1936 thrust her father, George, onto the throne, something for which neither he nor Elizabeth had been prepared. Less than three years later, Britain was drawn into a world war in which it would have to fight for its very survival. Like many children her age, Elizabeth was evacuated from London when it came under attack in 1940. She was only 14 years old when she made her first public address on the BBC, speaking directly to the many children who'd been evacuated and separated from their parents. When she turned 18, she insisted on joining the war effort, enlisting in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She wasn't given a special rank in this role, although she had already been made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards. The future queen trained as a mechanic in the ATS, and the word is that she still knows her way around an engine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elizabeth came to the throne 70 years ago, in 1952. Her coronation a year later was televised around the world—the first time this had ever happened. At the time, our Prime Minister was Sir Robert Menzies. Scott Morrison is now the 15th Prime Minister of Australia to serve during the Queen's reign. That is fully half of all the prime ministers we have had. The Queen is the first British monarch to reach a platinum jubilee. Few Australians alive today have ever known a time without Elizabeth as the Queen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I admire most about the Queen is her steadfast support for democracy in Australia as a constitutional monarchy. The Queen understands her role in this model like few others. The Queen understands it is the Australian people who govern our nation, and she has never interfered in our government or our elections. The Queen knows her history very well and knows that the authority of the Crown has been limited ever since the signing of the Magna Carta, which was in 1215. The last British monarch who tried to interfere directly in parliamentary government, by marching into the House of Commons to arrest some MPs—that was Charles I—started a civil war and was beheaded for treason. His descendants tried to restore the absolute rule of kings and queens, but in the end they failed. The authority of the British people, exercised through their elected parliament, has prevailed ever since. The authority of the people prevails in Australia too, or, at least, it did until this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our constitutional monarchy works well when its democratic principles are followed. This is why I do not support Australia becoming a republic. We are already in charge, not the Queen. We already have an Australian head of state, in our Governor-General. The Governor-General only acts on the advice of the elected Prime Minister of Australia. This system works, and, because it works, there is no need to change it. For those who do support a republic, I have this warning: the political class in Australia will never let you vote for a president; they will install their own president, and you will have no say over it. I shudder to think who might be installed. Let me think—Kevin Rudd, Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Fitzsimmons, or maybe Paul Keating? Or let's go with Christopher Pyne! Can you imagine the chaos? There's no need to go down such a divisive road. In a constitutional monarchy there is no division over an appointed head of state. It's a figurehead role by convention, and that's the way it should stay. If any future Governor-General should get it into their head to go beyond this role, they have the Queen's example to show them what a stupid idea that would be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Queen for her service to Australia and the Commonwealth and congratulate her on the unique achievement of a platinum jubilee. But I must also make my comments, or my thoughts, known with regard to the bedwetters and the haters. Where would they be, these ones that are complaining and whingeing about the monarchy and the Queen's service to the Commonwealth, if this country had been invaded—as they say, rather than 'settled'—by France, Spain or some other country? Would you have had the same opportunities to migrate here and have the life that you have? Here we have senators on the floor of parliament, such as the Greens, whinging, bitching and complaining about the monarchy. The fact is that it's because of the monarchy—and we are part of the Commonwealth—that you were given the opportunity to migrate to this country. You sit in the parliament now, under the Westminster system, the system under which you were elected, and have a very good lifestyle and a say in your country. It's called democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So don't put out there the factors of why you believe the monarchy has destroyed our democracy, because it hasn't. We became a federation in 1901, voted on by the people in this nation. The whole fact is to push your agenda of what is actually happening in Australia, and you want to hand it back to the First Nations people? I can imagine what this country would look like. I don't agree with it. It comes down to the fact that the people of this nation voted in 1999 against a republic: the politicians' republic—the people who want to take over control and tell the people because they think they know better. I don't think that is right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm here to congratulate the Queen. I have the utmost respect for her, as do many other people. To raise her family and what might be happening there is not what we're celebrating today or acknowledging. I'm sure a lot of families can look in their own backyards to see the problems they have within their own families. They are no different from a lot of people around the world. Yes, they hold positions and, yes, they are quite well to do, but the fact is that they are still a family. To sit there and criticise this woman who's given her whole life to her country, above and beyond her family and her husband—I admire the woman. I admire her greatly for what she's done. That is called dedication, loving your country and your people and doing the job that you didn't even think you would ever have but took on because of a set of circumstances. So, to the Queen and to those people who believe in the monarchy, let's celebrate her 70 years on the throne and congratulate her. And I do from the bottom of my heart.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  We've come to know the Queen in many different ways. We know the Queen as an image. We know the Queen through the passage of time. We know the Queen through her spirit, devotion and dedication. Sixteen presidents of the Australian Senate, 15 Australian prime ministers, 170 Commonwealth prime ministers and numerous presidents and popes—a record of public service that we could only dream of in this place. Indeed, in this Australian Senate, Senator Dodson was just four years and eight days old when the Queen ascended the throne. Senator Molan was just one year and nine months old when the Queen ascended the throne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia, we've been privileged to have her visit on six of the 16 occasions on which she's travelled to Australia. I like to think that six out of six is the number of times I perhaps stood by the road to catch a glimpse. But, of course, there are a variety of ways to look at this tremendous milestone. We can look at it through the lens of the societal and economic transformation that has taken place before her eyes. We can have a look at the durability of the Crown and the system of government that it has come to represent. We can also look at the subtle evolution of our own political system that has, over this tremendous period, also changed. And, of course, we can look at the Queen through the character of perseverance, devotion and service beyond self.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While today is a very important and auspicious occasion, it's also a very sad one. Of course, the Queen came to the throne only because of the passing of her father, the wartime monarch, George VI. I think it's important that, as we reflect on the virtues of this Queen, we also reflect on the tremendous virtues and, I would argue, tremendous unsung and unrecognised work of her father, George VI, during those bleakest hours not just in the United Kingdom and across continental Europe but, indeed, across the whole world. On the death of George VI, Menzies, in the other place, said that George VI had 'reigned over us with singular distinction, unfailing courage, and the most constant devotion'. When we reflect on the strengths of this Queen, I think we owe much to the fact that she was able to witness at first hand the tremendous contribution of her father and his ability to overcome physical difficulties and distrust in the British establishment. Of course, her father reigned for a comparatively short period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Menzies also went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We … hope that Your Majesty's reign—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the reign of the new Queen—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">may be a long and successful one, marked by the prosperity and progress of the countries of the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen's reign thus far has been synonymous with prosperity, discovery and scientific achievement. Of course, she's reigned in a world that has become more connected, not disconnected. Menzies could not have imagined how her reign has in fact realised those ambitions of prosperity and progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A decade ago, a prominent female, again in the other place, remarked on the Queen:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But beyond the statistics of this reign lies consideration of its quality and character. Today we honour a woman who has conducted herself with utmost propriety and dignity, who has served her people with wisdom, fidelity and an unfailing sense of duty. Elizabeth II has made history and become part of history. Today we honour her indelible place in the story of our nation. And we express thanks for the sense of loyalty and service she has shown as our monarch but also as our friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the decade since Julia Gillard made those remarks, much has changed, but of course the deep affection of so many Australians has only grown and become more entrenched. So, at the beginning of this Platinum Jubilee year, I am confident that Australians, whatever their political creed and whatever their ambitions for Australia's future form of government—and I remain totally committed to the preservation of constitutional monarchy—can all join together in an act of great unity and great grace in recognising what has been a most remarkable achievement thus far: service beyond self in a way that we cannot identify in any other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met the Queen in my home town of Perth in Western Australia. I was sat on a rug in a school hall in Perth's northern suburbs. I happened to glance up, and there on the wall was a picture. I kid you not—I can still see it now. I think it must have been at the time of the Silver Jubilee, in 1977, which would fit with my early years at primary school. For some unexplainable reason, I've chosen to find in her a great, deep affection and, in my own way, try to live my life in public service as she lives hers: practically, with humility and constantly with grace, and never disturbed by the less gracious comments that might be made about her or around her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this great occasion, on behalf of all those Western Australians that share a deep affection for this Queen, like I do, I extend to her and all those that support her across the world our deepest affection, our congratulations and our very best wishes for what we hope will be an outstanding Platinum Jubilee year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I stand here today as a proud First Nations woman. I want to start this speech by saying the sovereignty of these lands and waters was never ceded, and it was certainly never ceded to the person that today's motion is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastating impacts of colonialism are still experienced by First Nations people across this continent every single day. The colonial project started more than 200 years ago, and for me it's never ended. It still continues in this country for all First Nations people. It has attacked the heart of what First Nations people have lived under for generations, an ancient culture that has five principles. There is the principle of language and the importance of that. We've seen eradication—350 languages existed pre-colonisation, and we are now down to about 143 languages. There is the land that is important to us. It is our mother—our boodjar, as we call her in Noongar culture. It was removed from us when we were herded into missions and reserves. There is our culture, where our old people were beaten for fraternising with their relatives. There is our kinship, our family groups, our disconnection—it's been heard about in this place, about the royal commission on the stolen generations that have existed here in Australia—and the constant removal of our children. In my state of Western Australia alone, I am 17 times more likely to have my children removed than any other woman in this country. The law that was administered by our old people was replaced by the Westminster law that so many have talked about here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the greatest travesty that First Nations people on this continent are not treated equally in this country. We experience racism. We die decades earlier. And the trauma is intergenerational, is profound and is all caused by one foundational event—that is, the colonisation of this continent by the British Crown. It doesn't need to continue. This is not the end of this story. We know we cannot change the past but we can build a better future, and it starts with healing and bringing people together. But has to be grounded in humility and in seeking justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we do this? We achieve this together, and we achieve this, as has been so eloquently pointed out by my Australian Greens colleagues Senator Faruqi and Senator Steele-John, through a national treaty—an internationally recognised framework. Australia lags behind in relation to the way it treats its First Nations people but also in how it enters into these agreements, these treaties and a national treaty with First Nations people here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a recognised international leader, we have a significant role and responsibility to undertake this. Our journey to treaty involves truth-telling. This truth-telling will provide us with healing. We have to hear the stories and the lived experience of the generations of people who have been removed from country, who have been removed from their kinship connections and who have been removed from their language and culture. We have to hear that. We have to know that there is a black history attached to Australia's history and stop celebrating this facade. Our journey also involves making sure that we tackle the systemic discrimination and racism that exist in the system still, that are at the heart of colonialism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens have already announced that we will begin this journey towards treaty by contributing $250 million to establish a national and independent truth and justice commission. This truth and justice commission will be an independent body that investigates and reveals past wrongdoings to resolve ongoing and historical conflict and to help us all heal from those things and continue this journey forward together. The commission will have the powers of a royal commission and will investigate and reveal wrongdoings and the human rights abuses perpetrated against First Nations people since colonisation and to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country needs to do better, because we know we can do better. We just need the courage and the political will to make that change. Together we need to explore, understand and reckon with our past and the impact it continues to have on First Nations people and their cultures so we can build that future together, walk that path together. The only way we can do that is to start here, in the Senate, the place of the people. And we can do it through a national treaty and treaties with First Nations people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  There being no further contributions, I will close this debate. I wish to join in acknowledging the Platinum Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Our federation—indeed, this chamber—is 121 years old, and she has shared 70 of those years. Most Australians know no other way than the sacrifice and quiet acceptance of a role she did not choose but has inhabited without complaint and with unerring grace for all her life. We join in commemorating this moment with the community of 54 nations that we know today as the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her Majesty has been with us in person for some of the defining events of our nation. Her Majesty opened the Opera House in Sydney in 1973; in 1980, the High Court of Australia; and, in 1998, this building. Her Majesty's visit to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2011 in my home state of Western Australia was her 16th visit to Australia. We hope to have her example of wise and enduring service for many years to come. I am sure all senators will join me in expressing our sincerest congratulations to Her Majesty and in extending our warmest regards on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is also slipping behind the rest of the world in failing to establish a register of the ultimate beneficial ownership of companies, foundations and trusts. This is despite member nations of the G20 having agreed to lead by example and implement the recommendations of the FATF in relation to beneficial ownership at the 2014 Summit in Brisbane; and despite the government having released a consultation paper in 2016 regarding this implementation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens acknowledge that there are technical considerations with both measures that require considered drafting. Consequently, this private senator's bill does not seek to prescribe the details of this expansion in the scope of the Act. Instead, this Bill simply sets the parameters and timeframe for the government to bring forward legislation, and allows for relevant departments and agencies to undertake detailed drafting, an opportunity that is not available to senators who are not ministers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nonetheless, there has been widespread implementation internationally, and laborious analysis and consultation locally on both measures. Their application with countries with similar legislative structures to Australia is also well understood, as is their benefit in increasing the deterrence and detection of illicit activities, including tax evasion, money laundering, bribery, corruption and terrorism financing.</span>

Consistent with the minister's position, the Federal Court has previously found the advice requested to be privileged legal advice. Further, the freedom of information division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has also found that the minute requested was properly the subject of a cabinet exemption under the Freedom of Information Act.</span>

The entire purpose of legal professional privilege is to make sure that client-attorney advice is kept from court proceedings. So it has relevance there, but it has no relevance in this chamber. Likewise, with FOI on legal professional privilege, it's an absolute exemption; it does not have any relevance in this chamber.</span>

                    </a>  It remains the view of the government that national cabinet was established as a committee of cabinet and the documents and deliberations should remain confidential. On 17 September last year, the Prime Minister and all the leaders of state and territory governments made it clear that national cabinet has strengthened relationships by facilitating regular confidential discussions in the national interest, founded on the same principles of trust and confidence and collaboration which underpin state and territory and Commonwealth cabinets. Cabinet confidentiality is a longstanding principle of the Westminster system of government and a well-established ground for a claim of public interest immunity with respect to orders by the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  Labor has long been supportive of greater scrutiny of the operations of the national cabinet, particularly through the Select Committee on COVID-19. Senator Patrick's motion reflects the frustrations of the opposition that the orders of the Senate continue to be refused. Given the ruling of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, it is not acceptable for the government to persist with the view that deliberations of national cabinet should remain confidential. Calling a body a cabinet does not make it the same as cabinet.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  At the request of Senator Chisholm, I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The failure of leadership by the Prime Minister to address the behaviour of Senators Rennick and Antic, and Mr George Christensen MP, which is a risk to the health and good order of the Australian community by spreading disinformation about vaccinations and other COVID-19 public health measures; supporting anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown protests and their leaders, some of whom have publicly called for the violent overthrow of state and federal governments and the murder of public servants, including members of the Australian Defence Force; standing alongside protestors who attack the social and democratic institutions which have created a successful, prosperous, multicultural Australia; and whose behaviour may encourage others to emulate them by reason of their high profile and status.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I heard from Susan, an aged-care worker. Susan has been working in the aged-care sector for 17 years. She says that the facility she currently works for is at breaking point because of the pandemic and because of the government's failure to support that sector throughout this critical omicron phase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Staff shortages mean that she finds herself solely responsible for a floor of 40 elderly people. And when two or three or four buzzers go off at the same time, as they always seem to do, she actually has to decide who she is going to help, whose needs she is going to prioritise and who is most important. She has to take responsibility. She has to make a choice. She doesn't have the option that Prime Minister Morrison gives himself time and time again, and that is to say that it's someone else's problem and shrug the responsibility off onto someone else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention Susan because this morning, to meet with her, I had to go past a large crowd of people outside the parliament who are angry about lifesaving vaccinations and public health measures associated with the pandemic. This is a group of people that coalition members, members of the coalition party room and members of this Senate have been directly speaking to and encouraging for some time. It's been reported that some of the coalition party room were down there at the rally in person. Senator Rennick is reported in the media to have said that he is 'working to make sure that our children aren't vaccinated'. You would think, wouldn't you, that the Prime Minister might be concerned that members of his party room were spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines? If not that, you'd think he might be concerned that members of his party room are addressing protests whose leaders have publicly called for the violent overthrow of state and federal governments and the murder of public servants. Apparently, he's not concerned about that, not interested in that. He's silent. It's not his responsibility and not his problem. It's a shame actually that the Prime Minister didn't meet with Susan because, if he did, he could have learned something about what it means to take responsibility and make difficult decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Actually, calling out vaccine misinformation and extremism shouldn't be a difficult decision. It should be an easy choice for any leader with integrity. The reasons provided by the government for the cancellation of Novak Djokovic's visa actually spell out why it's dangerous for someone with a high profile and status to be stoking anti-vaccine sentiment. In the government's own words: 'It may encourage others to emulate him. If others were encouraged to take up or maintain resistance to vaccination or COVID-19 restrictions then that would present a problem for the health of individuals and the operation of Australia's hospital system.' They went on to say: 'His presence may lead to rallies and protests that may themselves be a source of community transmission.' They were the issues when it came to Mr Djokovic, but we have had members of the coalition party room doing all of these things and, in fact, much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had false medical claims from and distrust of science being provoked by Senator Rennick. He said, 'All the data says that they're neither safe nor effective.' What data is he referring to? He went on, on the basis of this false claim, to say, 'It is criminally negligent to roll out booster shots without any attempt at rectifying these serious safety issues first.' If distrust in science and medicine isn't bad enough, we then had Senator Antic, who has been out there peddling distrust in government. Here is a quote from Senator Antic:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Power hungry bureaucrats and a largely pedestrian media have fuelled fear in our community for two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the rallies in Canberra this week, he said, 'We are with you all the way.' Mr Christensen, serial offender, went further and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I watched with pride over the past few days as thousands of Australians uprooted their lives and drove to the nation's capital to send a message to all politicians: we want our freedoms back!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was an unsurprising statement in some ways. Mr Christensen gave a speech last year comparing vaccine mandates and COVID restrictions to a totalitarian regime. He then called for civil disobedience. This was at a time when protesters were constructing gallows out the front of a state parliamentary building. It comes on top of two years of Mr Christensen boosting unproven and dangerous alternative COVID treatments. During the time that Mr Craig Kelly was a member of the coalition party room, the Prime Minister stood idly by while Mr Kelly disseminated false COVID information and misinformation on social media. Facebook has taken more action against Mr Kelly than the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why hasn't the Prime Minister done anything? When asked why his government had acted on Novak Djokovic and not coalition backbenchers Mr Morrison said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… you're conflating two different issues … In Australia, if you're an Australian, you're a citizen, you're resident and you're a citizen, you can be here and you can express your views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a hollow and vacuous response that trivialises the issues at stake! It also serves to minimise the Prime Minister's responsibility. The truth is, they are not merely Australian citizens, are they? They are members of the Prime Minister's party room. They are members of the government that he leads. He ought to take responsibility for their behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Prime Minister Joyce took time out from texting to say, 'What can we do?' As much as immigration minister Alex Hawke would like, he can't send any of our politicians to Serbia. Again, what a trivial response, because he's right: that's not an option for the PM. I'll tell you what the Prime Minister could do. He could publicly rebuke them. He could have called them out in a party room meeting. Calling people out in the party room happened this week and in any other week. He could have cornered them for a private conversation, like he did with Bridget Archer, when Mrs Archer had the temerity to cross the floor last year. Why hasn't he done anything like this? It's pretty obvious: it's because there is nothing in it for him. It's because, as former Premier Berejiklian allegedly wrote, the Prime Minister puts politics before people. He never takes responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Prime Minister's silence matters. The government's Federal Court submissions in the Djokovic matter make the point that antivaccine rhetoric can have a real impact on the health of individuals and the operation of Australia's health system. It means that people like Susan, the aged-care nurse, have even more elderly and sick patients to care for and more difficult choices to make about who they are able to care for. I tell you what, the health of our public debate matters as well. Any success that we have had in combatting this pandemic is due in no small part to the willingness of the Australian people to band together and to make sacrifices. Australians have worn masks. They have stayed home from work and school. They have rescheduled their weddings and, heartbreakingly, some of them have had virtual funerals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statements by some members of this coalition undermine that solidarity. They undermine faith in the science that has delivered the vaccines and the public health measures that have saved tens of thousands of Australian lives. They undermine the trust in government and in our public institutions that we will need to deal with the next pandemic or the next strain of this virus, or, indeed, the next crisis we confront as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is broader than the pandemic. By encouraging and standing beside extremists, government members and senators are legitimising them. There is something qualitatively different about protests that call people traitors and that seek to dehumanise them. We've seen where that kind of politics leads in our history and in our global history, and it's not to a democratic place and it is not to a safe place. A leader of any integrity would call out the members of his own government who are spreading COVID misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, and encouraging violent protest. But where is Mr Morrison? There may be nothing in it for Mr Morrison politically, but he should use the weight of his position to defend the integrity of our public debate, because that is the right thing to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="123072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I rise in defence of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, not just for my colleagues but for every single person in this place and, indeed, all of Australia. Western civilisation has been founded on the freedom to speak out, but Labor does not believe in free speech. Labor doesn't care about people, only ideologies that deny freedom for every parent, business owner, religious person and farmer. Surely the ability for every Australian to be fully engaged in this pandemic and its response is not only a good idea but a necessary idea for our mental health and our recovery from this situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the most left-wing Labor opposition we have seen in decades. After the last election it's lurched, if possible, even more to the left. They're quick to condemn conservative politicians for speaking out, but they're silent when those on the left support Invasion Day, anti-Christian rhetoric, shaming of conservative women and calls for quotas. How many Labor and Greens MPs support socialism, communism or violent left-wing groups such as Black Lives Matter and antifa? Do these groups get to express their views while others can't? Labor's double standards are a joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't agree with the stance taken by Mr Christensen and Senators Rennick and Antic, but I will fight every day for their right to represent those Australians who share their views, because parliament should be the one place where we can have an open and vigorous debate—where we can contest ideas. This idea that these people are calling for harm to police and politicians is truly outrageous. Those are certainly not the actions and words of these named members and senators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, hundreds of thousands of Australians have raised these issues and have marched against mandates without incident. These are everyday men, women and children, from CEOs to pensioners, pilots, nurses and teachers. They are not enemies of the state. My office has taken scores of calls from doctors, nurses, tradies, truckies, lawyers, cleaners, parents, grandparents, dairy farmers and others against mandates. I and others in this place have publicly supported that view, while Senators Rennick and Antic and Mr Christensen are showing their support in different ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vaccination rates in Australia are amongst the highest in the world. Close to 90 per cent of people are getting their health advice from doctors, not from politicians. However, it was not that long ago that, in Queensland, the Chief Health Officer suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine was going to kill young people. That was the beginning of serious concern in our community over the AstraZeneca vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Labor who are playing politics with public health. In January 2021, the Labor candidate for Higgins, Dr Ananda-Rajah, tweeted multiple times undermining the effectiveness of—yes—the AstraZeneca vaccine. The doctor has also criticised Doherty institute director Sharon Lewin and former Victorian deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng for lacking 'any real expertise in pandemic planning or response'. As two of Australia's foremost public health experts, who have worked tirelessly to assist both the Commonwealth and state governments to respond to the pandemic and to save lives, Professor Lewin and Dr Cheng should be praised for their efforts. Indeed, this federal Labor opposition is preferencing an Independent COVID antivaxxer ahead of the Nationals in the upcoming state by-election in Monaro. The double standards are extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To use a now-common phrase: how dare you? How dare you in Labor look down on those people who have different views to you—Australians who hold different views? How dare you smear those with genuinely held concerns and beliefs as would-be thugs and murderers? You want to deny a person's lawful right to speak and protest, because Labor is now the epitome of the new, sneering elite. The unvaccinated are a minority, but they're not the correct type of minority for Labor, so their views and concerns don't matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of crusading against freedom, how about you get into regional Queensland and ask what's important to them? In Queensland, my great state, it has been the sort of misinformation that has been spread on social media after comments like those I've already quoted—the vaccine hesitancy about AstraZeneca—which has allowed a whole lot of views to grow up. As a federal government, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been nothing short of world-leading. We were able to stem the tide of COVID in this nation to allow time for people to become vaccinated, to save jobs and save lives, and to ensure that our unemployment rate is now down to 4.2 per cent so that Australians are able to get off social security, to have a job and to engage in the world and the life that they want. That is because the government's priority is the safety and wellbeing of all Australians. To that end, the government has spent significant money and effort in combating this misinformation. There is a COVID-19 misinformation portal for COVID-19 mythbusting on the australia.gov.au website that corrects myths and misinformation. The Department of Home Affairs reviews and refers online misinformation about COVID-19 to social media platforms to request that it be taken down, and $116.1 million has been committed to the National COVID-19 Vaccine Campaign. We know that has been successful—look at our vaccination rates in this country. As I said at the beginning, Australians generally take their medical advice from a health professional and not from politicians, and that is a wise decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This misinformation that has been allowed to spread has created genuine concern in people right across this nation, and it is our responsibility to talk to them, to hold out our hand, to listen and to understand those genuine concerns and try and assist them to understand what is the best medical assistance and the best medical advice for them, for their families and for their children. That is our role. It is not in any way our role to look down on these people as somehow being wrong or stupid, and it certainly is not our role to suggest that they can't hold these views at all. That's not the sort of country we are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for those members and senators who have listened to those people and are trying to represent their views and ensure that they are heard in order to allow for better government planning and better government responses, that is only the right thing to do, instead of this elitist, sneering response from Labor—this 'holier than thou, smarter than you, inner city' kind of response that we in regional Australia are sick of. We're sick of feeling disconnected from Labor and we're sick of them having no understanding of our industries and infrastructure and the genuine concerns that we hold. We are the part of the nation that does the mining, grows the agriculture and has the terrific communities that we're so very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue to defend the rights of Mr Christensen and Senators Antic and Rennick to support Australians right across this country who have genuine concerns and genuine misgivings. It's our responsibility to assist them—not sneer at them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I speak as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. It's a matter of urgency that our elected parliamentary representatives are increasingly not a reflection of the typical, everyday Australian. It's fundamental to our Australian democracy that people can demonstrate against incursions of their freedoms. I applaud any politician who has the guts, the integrity and the resolve to make a stand for the people, even if it is against their party line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chisholm has done well to show his true self in this MOU, where he believes that only good order should reign at the expense of individual voices. Senator Chisholm clearly believes politicians ought not to use their public profile and status to represent the deep concerns of the people. Does Senator Chisholm suggest politicians use their high profile and status to be solely compliant and silent? I believe that politicians have a duty to listen to our consciences and speak out when we believe something is not in the interests of the Australian people. Senator Chisholm's urgency motion says more about his narrow Labor perspective on life than it does about the topic or about the Australian people. Personally, I'm proud to stand beside anyone who has the courage of their convictions and who is brave enough to take their unpopular stand and risk ridicule for their beliefs. I admire anyone, particularly politicians, who have not lost sight of the Australian people, our democracy, our values or our freedoms and who will stand with the people regardless of the party line. I have done so and will proudly continue to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators Rennick and Antic, and Mr George Christensen and Mr Craig Kelly, have the mettle to stand for a broader Australia. I support their efforts to question, expose and call out the deliberate misuse and abuse of science—the fraudulent use of science—as a basis for lockdowns and vaccine mandates. Senator Chisholm's motion has demonstrated his belief that there should be only one world view held by all, and Senator Chisholm will decide what that view is no matter how far removed this groupthink is from how Australians see ourselves. The good order of the Australian community requires debate and dissent, compliance and cohesion, and, most of all, robustness and honesty. Our social and democratic institutions—failing, as they are, to protect the rights and freedoms of the people—must be robust enough to embrace a debate from the people and from politicians who represent them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is there low, and declining, trust in MPs? Here is a quote from someone today: 'Declining trust in our institutions is not the problem. It is the solution.' We need to have less of the institutions. It's a sad day when any politician, whose career and life is predominantly political, thinks that his narrow world perspective has any resonance with the Australian people at large. Senators Rennick and Antic, and Mr Christensen, are fighting for the people because they themselves are of the people, having carved out independent careers from the city to the land, facing uncertainties along the way. Senator Hanson and I have this same grounding in real life. From their actions these representatives, like us, feel what the people are feeling. They know, as One Nation knows, that unnecessary lockdowns, debilitating and inhuman vaccine mandates, and an absence of longitudinal testing on vaccines is just not good enough. They know that the people deserve better and are willing to stand up for what is right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also talk about ivermectin—a proven, safe, effective, affordable and accessible treatment that has stopped COVID wherever it has been used properly. The government falls silent on it and actually withdrew that from the people. The real matter of urgency here is that too many Labor, Liberal, National and Greens politicians do not have the courage to stand against this attack on our freedom and basic human rights. Too many in this place stand meek and silent while businesses fail and while everyday Australians are coerced into a repeated, unproven medical experimental procedure in order to feed their families. It's time that gutless, groupthink politicians are consigned to the biowaste bin of history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="16913" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to speak on this urgency motion. This debate is in no way a debate about free speech. Australians have free speech. It's in no way a debate about the right to protest. I've been involved in plenty of protests. This is a debate about political leadership and about whether the office of Prime Minister is going to be used for political leadership. I listened carefully to Senator McDonald, and I have to say that, until this moment, I had no idea how degraded the Nationals commitment to political liberalism has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former senator Ron Boswell recognised the threat to Australian democracy that the One Nation Party posed. He fought them and opposed them right through Queensland, in this place and at the ballot box. The modern National Party just seeks to incorporate those views. It doesn't recognise the threat to Australian democracy that's posed by the kinds of views being put out there in a systematic way by Mr Christensen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Christensen, in the material that he propagates around the place, supports violent extremism. He cosies up to people who—let's call a spade a spade—are fascists. They are a threat to democracy. I had a look at Mr Christensen's website before coming in here. He caught support from some of the darkest recesses of far-Right movements overseas. He has a page on there that says 'Reject the Great Reset'. It's got references, in the usual anti-Semitic tropes used by these extremists, to poor old Mr George Soros; I don't know what he ever did to offend these people. It's the usual anti-Semitic tropes—'new world order', 'global elites'. It's the kind of terminology that, on that side of this place and in Mr Morrison's office, has become a political plaything for people who don't recognise the seriousness of the threat and don't understand their political responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about free speech; people can say whatever they like. This is about whether Mr Morrison is prepared to act in the national interest, in the interests of Australian democracy and in the interests of what used to be the party that represented the liberalist trend in Australian political thinking. It has now drifted to the far Right, not become more conservative. Traditional conservatives—former leaders, former prime ministers, former Liberal leaders, former Nationals leaders—are repulsed. John McEwen would be repulsed by the ideology being propagated by this group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the United Kingdom a Labour MP was murdered by people professing the same ideology being propagated by Mr Christensen. More recently a Conservative MP was murdered doing their day-to-day work as a politician, because people like Mr Johnson in the United Kingdom have decided, in desperate political circumstances, that it's okay to propagate far-Right political conspiracy theories and mobilise people around those ideals to try and damage your political opponents. These things have consequences in our democracy. Nobody is arguing that people don't have the right to protest, nobody is arguing that people don't have the capacity for free speech; what we're after is political leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside, of course, there are people who have different views. More people should listen to the science about the COVID-19 pandemic, about the important role that vaccinations must play in keeping us all safe and about the role of the public health measures. There has been enormous pain in our community as a result of the public health measures that have had to be taken, in no small part because of the failure of Mr Morrison to deliver vaccines on time, to get rapid antigen tests out there and to ensure there's personal protective equipment in aged care. These are the things that have driven the pandemic and made things harder for ordinary Australians. But what we've got out the front, which Senator Rennick and Senator Antic and Mr Christensen are urging on with all the others down there, is a group of fascists and fringe dwellers and some fixated persons. A person was arrested out there with a sawn-off rifle last week, and there are people over here, and Mr Morrison, who think that's not a problem. What does it take for the modern Liberal Party, and what passes for the National Party these days, to take these things seriously? When people assemble outside parliaments with nooses, it has consequences. It's not reasonable debate; it's a threat of violence. I saw yesterday what happened to the British Labour leader, with loops and extremists chasing him down the street. The good work of the protective services in the United Kingdom is what saved him from a very serious assault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that Australians do not support this madness. They have voted with their feet. Well over 90 per cent have received two doses of the vaccine. Australians trust scientists, they trust healthcare professionals and they trust each other. But Mr Morrison has failed to stand up to the extremists on his own back bench, and we know why. In one of his occasional truth bombs—we had another one last week, via text—Mr Joyce made it clear why Mr Morrison won't take Mr Christensen on: it's because Mr Morrison relies upon Mr Christensen's vote over there in the House, and Mr Joyce relies upon Mr Christensen's vote in the Nationals party room. There's not an ounce of political courage or principle left in this Prime Minister—no courage and no principle. He has kowtowed to extremists and kowtowed to violent political extremism, and, as a consequence, it's become more and more prominent in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Christensen still sits in the party room. He still has a vote in the caucus, and those opposite, who know this man much better than we do, have known for a very long time how dangerously off course he has gone. I've said it; I wrote to Minister Andrews in November last year, and to the Australian Federal Police, when I saw threats of political violence—direct threats—made on Mr Christensen's Telegram account. There have been crickets from Minister Andrews and crickets from Mr Morrison. They have no capacity to stand up. And what do we have revealed today? Mr Christensen is spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money, public money, every month—hundreds of thousands of dollars over his term in office—to propagate extremist political ideology, to make things worse and to undermine the public health message. Yet all we have here, and what I anticipate we're about to have, is some quisling defence based on free speech, as if anybody is arguing here about free speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just want a prime minister who puts the national interest first, puts Australia first and puts Australian democracy first. I'm afraid we're going to have to wait for an election before we get one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  What we're witnessing this afternoon is Labor's attempt at a tawdry reinvention of Hillary Clinton's 'deplorables'—a comment which divided United States society and saw the person who was going to be elected as the President of the United States defeated by the people because of their repulsion at this sort of politics that Hillary Clinton failed to execute and that, I predict, Labor will fail to execute with this tawdry motion. Isn't it amazing that this motion is put forward by a Queensland senator? The Queensland state Labor government was the government that sought to scare people from the AstraZeneca vaccine. Oh, there's no mention of that in the contributions—no mention whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the motion, if you read it in detail, you will see that these gentlemen are being condemned for even standing alongside certain people. Well, the acting leader of the opposition in this place got caught out recently, didn't she, standing alongside operatives of the Communist Party of China, that brutal dictatorship? She was standing alongside such an operative. Does the Labor Party condemn her for that? There's stony silence. Indeed, the acting leader of the Labor Party in this place—I would suggest possibly unwittingly—appointed people that have now served jail terms to her ministry and the Labor Party while she was Premier of New South Wales. How did they defend the criminally convicted Craig Thomson when he was sitting in the House of Representatives? The list of Labor debacles in this space goes on and on. One wonders how this Labor motion even saw the light of day. The lack of self-awareness in this motion is genuinely and truly concerning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this debate, sure, there is a narrative at the moment as to the best way to deal with COVID. Let's remind ourselves that Denmark, Sweden and Norway are not in the dark recesses of far-Right clutches but they have just determined to remove all barriers whatsoever in relation to COVID—no more mandates, no more mask wearing and no more limits on crowd numbers—based on their medical advice. 'Listen to the science' is often used as a mantra to shut others down, to cancel them. There are alternative points of view held by men and women skilled in science. Often they are quoted by my colleagues. Do we agree with them? That's not the issue. The issue is: do they have the right to put those views to the public? They do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just remind people in this place that men and women of good faith and who are highly intelligent can actually come to differing conclusions on exactly the same matters. I refer to the High Court: seven men and women who are sworn into office, who are of a high intellect and who are capable lawyers. They hear the same evidence and apply the same law, and then these seven men and women sometimes come to a 4-3 decision. Are they somehow in the clutches of some conspiratorial force? No, they are not. They are men and women of good faith who have exercised a judgement in relation to a certain matter. If High Court judges can be so divided on these matters, why can't Australian citizens be divided in relation to mandates, mask wearing or whether or not they want to have a vaccine? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I have consistently been against the concept of mandates. I don't want to see a divided society. I don't want to see a two-tiered society based on those that are vaccinated and those that are not vaccinated. Those men and women who make a choice are entitled to their jobs. We are, as we speak, seeing university students in Tasmania being told, 'You cannot continue with your studies if you are not vaccinated,' as a result of which their dreams are shattered, the public is denied their expertise and, halfway through, they have a HECS debt that they were expecting to pay off after graduation. They're now being denied that opportunity but are still being left with a debt. The same applies to TAFE in my home state of Tasmania. It's completely unacceptable that apprentices should be denied the opportunity. We have a shortage of tradesmen. We have a shortage of nurses, doctors and surgeons, and they're now being denied the right to practise and be of service to the community. I happen to be pro-vaccination but antimandates, and that is a right and proper position to hold, and I will defend it most vehemently with those who have an alternative view to mine in relation to vaccination. My view has always been that in this debate we should seek to educate and not discriminate. We should seek to convince and not coerce. That is the way a civilised society and community seeks to go about a discussion. And, yes, what I would say to colleagues and others is: if you are so convinced of your position, you should have no fear of an opposite view being put to you. If anything, your counter to that view will show that your initial view is in fact correct, whereas, if you cannot counter it properly, what it informs you to do is to nuance your position to accept that that which has been countering your view has some merit to it, and you need to adjust your position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most disappointing about this debate is not only Labor's hypocrisy in putting forward this motion but the relentless negativity of Labor and their failure to put forward an alternative point of view and an alternative platform. Where are they in this debate? Their big criticism is for three members of the coalition. You know what? The average Australian is not concerned about two senators and a House of Representatives member; they're concerned about the fundamentals of Australian government. Allow me to read the following list. It's why the Australian Labor Party don't want to talk real policy. We have had 1.1 million jobs created since the pandemic hit. How about a motion of congratulations in relation to that? Deathly silence from Labor. To continue: 11.5 million Australians are benefiting from tax relief, 700,000 jobs were saved through JobKeeper, 71.3 per cent of trade and exports are now covered by free trade agreements, there were 815,600 female business operators in Australia as of August 2021, 220,000 trade apprentices is a record high, there has been a 20 per cent reduction in emissions since 2005, and electricity bills are down eight per cent in the past two years. They're the sorts of things people talk about: apprenticeships for their sons and daughters and their electricity bill and how can they afford to pay it. These are the real issues, and they are what the Labor Party formerly discussed on a regular basis. But today—no, no, no. Those cost-of-living issues, those things that are actually discussed under the corrugated iron roofs of our suburbs, are no longer the matters that excite the interest of the Australian Labor Party. What excites them are political stunts and their attempts to divide our society. If anybody disagrees with their elitist view of the world, they need to be shut down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the moments left, how about 1,213 major transport projects supporting 100,000 jobs and over 99 per cent of homes and businesses with NBN access? Despite COVID, the Morrison government has done a fantastic job, and all that Labor can point to is some illusory view about three coalition backbenchers. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  To quote Russell Crowe from <span style="font-style:italic;">Gladiator</span>, Senator Abetz, the time for honouring yourself and your government will soon be at an end. Sitting here listening to the achievements of this government, I find it no wonder that Australians are so exasperated, so frustrated and so despairing at the state of politics in this country. We have maybe five days in this parliament this year; that's it. With five sitting days before, almost certainly, an election that has to be held for this august chamber by 22 May, what do we have on the agenda? We have a government fighting culture wars, bringing in a religious discrimination bill to discriminate against transgender individuals—citizens in this country who have rights. We see in the media, making up the bulk of news stories, exchanges of text messages between senior members of the LNP, Mr Peter Dutton in the other place and the Prime Minister, and we see Mr Barnaby Joyce calling the Prime Minister a psycho and a psychopath and who knows what else. This government is just a long series of dumpster fires. This parliament has been non-stop chaos, scandal and corruption. And, in just a few months time—in fact, in less than 100 days—Australians have a chance to go to the polls and take back the power from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I and many other Australians are most despairing of the fact that this chaos is distracting from so many important things and so much reform we need in this place, and from the great challenges of our time. I accept that COVID has been a very difficult few years for all of us, for all Australians and, in fact, the whole international community, and we're not out of the woods yet. But we also are still seeing a relentless assault on our environment by big corporations hell-bent on propping up their balance sheets, hell-bent on growing their earnings per share so they can keep their share prices up, and going out and exploring 80,000 kilometres of new ocean acreage for oil and gas at a time when the International Energy Agency tells us that 2021 has to be the last year of oil and gas exploration on this planet if we're to stick to 1.5 degrees of warming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I despair when I look at my home state of Tasmania where the Tarkine is still under assault. Mining company MMG, a company that cares only about money and its own profits, wants to go into some of the most precious Gondwana rainforest left on this planet—which, according to information recently released by the Bob Brown Foundation released information is a breeding ground for the rare and endangered masked owls—and build a toxic tailings dam on a beautiful river in the Tarkine and goldmine a forest. And in Blue Derby, where mountain biking has turned that town into a transition town, so-called Sustainable Timbers Tasmania want to log right up to the mountain bike tracks, even though the reason that this place has been so successful is because of its beauty, its rareness and its geology. It is on the international map, yet we still want to log it, even after tens of millions of dollars of federal and state money have gone into investing in a different future to forestry. But we just can't let go. And we see oil and gas companies, as usual, getting the run of the roost in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be different in three months time. I have absolute faith and confidence that Australians have had enough of the chaos and enough of the corruption and they want change. I believe that, and I believe I will be vindicated on election night. We can take this country in a new direction.</span>

                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  It is interesting to listen to the contributions this evening by senators in this place. For the past two years Australians have come together to get through this pandemic. Essentially that's been the core message from the motion of Senator Chisholm: how many Australians are coming together, and have come together, to get through these very difficult and unprecedented times. However, by respecting one another and receiving advice from leaders and experts, we have kept safe our friends and families and many other loved ones throughout our various communities, which are represented in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there have been rules that have been difficult to follow, and there have been different rules in different parts of the country. While some directions might not have been intuitive to some of us, the vast majority of Australians have understood that defeating COVID is the core goal here. Defeating COVID is important, because if we don't then there will be other consequences that we will face. What we have seen around the world is that for those that have not been at the front of the curve there have been thousands upon thousands upon thousands of deaths every single week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the Morrison-Joyce government completely bungling the vaccine rollout, most Australians turned up to get their jab as soon as they could. That was because of many decisions that were taken by state governments, rather than by the federal government. Many of these Australians—in fact, over 90 per cent of these Australians, the vast majority of Australians—have trusted the science. They've trusted their doctors. They have trusted the many experts in the healthcare professions and they got vaccinated not just to protect themselves but to protect their loved ones. This trust is the very foundation of our society. None of us can be an expert on everything, and I don't think anyone in this place claims to be, but we do trust in others to provide us with advice and guidance on very complicated and complex issues. That's why we have departments. That's why we listen to experts. I know there are many individuals in this place and in the other place who are very sceptical about some of the advice that they receive, but, thankfully, the vast majority of us do take on advice from scientists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certain members of the government—and many have been outlined in Senator Chisholm's motion—have consistently undermined and attacked the information that Australians are relying on to keep them safe, and that is core to our debate today. Members of this government have used their platforms as elected representatives to spread mistruths and disinformation about vaccines and about other important public health measures. It's interesting to listen to those opposite who claim that we somehow are lecturing them. If you listened to the contributions that were made then one might have to say that it is a bit of a lecture from others to tell us that we are wrong when we point out that health experts should be taken seriously. Yes, they can be critiqued, and, yes, we should be able to question their advice, but at the end of the day, when you have multiple health experts around the country in very different jurisdictions saying the same thing, one has to ask: how can they be wrong?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These members of the government have stoked the flames of division in our communities, feeding the worst of our instincts. They have done their best to turn Australians against each other rather than unite them. Thanks to those members, some Australians now no longer trust their family doctor. If you believe some of their harmful ideas, our hardworking nurses and paramedics are all part of a worldwide conspiracy instead of being the selfless heroes most of us know they are. Instead of focusing on creating jobs and cutting bills, members of this government are detracting from the efforts of all Australians to beat this virus and get on with their lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I had a fulsome speech prepared, but given the lateness of the hour I won't make it. I'll just make this point: getting vaccinated is a sensible and responsible thing to do. That's why Australians have taken up the opportunity to do that. But, I have to say, I am against mandating vaccination. In my home state we are seeing extraordinary measures being taken to coerce people to get vaccinated. As I said, it's the sensible and responsible thing to do. I myself am triple dosed, and I encourage people to do it. But you can't even go to a drive-through bottle shop in Western Australia without showing your vaccination certification. That's just a vindictive attitude, I think, that the state government have taken against Western Australians who, on the balance of all the evidence they have, have decided for themselves that they don't want that medical procedure. They're only putting themselves at risk. The data is showing that you're protecting yourself, but it's not doing much actually to reduce transmission.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  I am just resuming where I left off earlier today. I outlined at the outset that the Labor caucus has decided to approach the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 as a matter of conscience for our members. I outlined that I would be supporting the bill, and I'll explain why a little bit further into my contribution here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I was doing earlier today was simply explaining some of the factual basis for what the bill is proposing to do. I think I left off where I was distinguishing between two of the different techniques for mitochondrial donation which are under consideration within this bill. The two techniques are known as maternal spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer. Maternal spindle transfer means the transfer of the nuclear DNA from the mother into the donor's egg, which happens before the donor's egg is fertilised by the father's sperm. The second technique, known as pronuclear transfer, involves both eggs—the donor's egg and the mother's egg—being fertilised. The mother's nuclear DNA is removed from her fertilised egg and inserted into the donor's fertilised egg, which has its pronuclear DNA removed. The reason I go over that again is that it is an important distinction, especially as we are all considering our views on this bill, because the pronuclear transfer happens after the fertilisation of the egg, and the mother's fertilised egg is then destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the vote on this bill, due to its sensitive nature, will be a matter of conscience for members of the Labor Party caucus. This is an extremely delicate issue that raises some very deeply held and serious ethical and faith based beliefs among many in our community. Sadly, mitochondrial disease often has a human consequence, and that is one of the reasons for my decision to support this bill. It can be fatal for very young children, causing enormous grief and real suffering to their families, and there are hundreds of heartbreaking examples. I will go through just a couple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Baby Chloe Mets was conceived by IVF and was born happy and healthy to first-time parents Joanne and Allan. When Chloe was just six weeks old, a specialist broke the news that their beautiful baby girl might have mitochondrial disease but there was no treatment or cure for the disease. Their bundle of joy was in good health until her immunisations triggered an episode of acute distress and led to an imbalance of chemicals in her little body. The mito episodes were unpredictable and traumatic. Chloe was in and out of hospital for about six weeks. A series of medications kept her relatively stable right up until her final day. Her parents say that she kept people guessing from the moment she was born until the very moment they lost her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chloe was diagnosed with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder. Her parents were told there is only one other case with the same genetic mutation. Joanne then discovered she carries the same mutation, but she's never shown any symptoms. Now she and her husband are in a process of understanding what the mutation means for their family. They believe that legalised mitochondrial donation would give them an opportunity to have a child who doesn't have to experience the same devastating impacts of mitochondrial disease that Chloe did. They are holding on to hope that mitochondrial donation will be an available option. And they're not alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bethany Hodge grew up watching her sister suffer the symptoms of mitochondrial disease, including tremors in her hands, balance issues, hearing loss, speech impairment and intellectual delay. Her family knew there was something wrong, but doctors could not determine the cause of her symptoms or what could be done to help Bethany's sister. After suffering with no solution for years, Bethany's sister was eventually diagnosed with a type of mitochondrial disease called MERRF, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres. It was soon discovered that Bethany, her mother and her brother were also carriers of this disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bethany grew up watching her sister suffer through the pain of this disease, which makes it difficult to eat, dress, read and write. Now Bethany is ready to start a family of her own and is terrified to pass on that pain to her children. Bethany says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mitochondrial donation would allow my partner and I to start a family with the peace of mind … It will stop this vicious cycle of it being passed on from generation to generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, I recognise that there are a range of views on this bill, both within the Labor caucus and across this chamber. It is important that these matters get proper consideration and that all of the ethical, medical and other factors concerning the bill are fully examined. I want to acknowledge the work that a range of groups have done to examine this bill and the potential role of and ethics surrounding mitochondrial donation. A Senate inquiry looking at this matter was held a couple of years ago, and I was a member of the committee that undertook that inquiry. Of course, there's been a more recent inquiry in relation to the bill itself. Since that initial Senate inquiry there's also been an NHMRC review, and the Department of Health issued a discussion paper which gave members of the public an opportunity to have their say on something that is really important and a challenging topic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for me, I consider that this bill is an important step in ensuring that families like Joanne's and Bethany's can live without the devastating pain that this disease causes. I recognise, once again, that mitochondrial donation is a scientific development that members of our community may struggle with. That's why I think it is important that what this bill proposes is a pretty cautious approach to allowing mitochondrial donation to occur. What is proposed initially is its application in research, before empowering the creation of regulations which would allow for wider implementation of mitochondrial donation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons I am comfortable supporting this bill is that I think it is putting forward a highly regulated framework that takes into account ethical considerations and that also requires more research to be undertaken. I feel that there are some good parameters being put around the adoption of what is a challenging and new technology. I believe that this bill has struck the balance in addressing the ethical concerns of members of the public by providing a regulated, careful rollout while also providing a path forward to improve the quality of life for thousands of Australian families. Mitochondrial donation, if this bill is passed, will be introduced in a staged way. I think that is the right approach for a challenging topic like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, because of the real benefits that I think this will provide to thousands of Australians, because of the way that ethical considerations have been dealt with in this bill and because of the regulated framework that is being put forward, I am personally offering my support for the bill and I will be voting for it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  Mitochondrial diseases are significant, life-limiting, serious diseases. In Australia each year around 56 children are born with mitochondrial diseases. These diseases develop as a result of genetic faults within the DNA of our cells' mitochondria—parts of our cells that provide the very power for the body's cells. When a fault in the mitochondria is transferred from the parent's egg to a child, there is a likelihood that the child will be born with mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 moves us closer to granting people the ability to make a choice when they are considering conceiving a child. This choice enables a medical procedure that would allow people to decide not to pass this genetic abnormality on to their child. Passing Maeve's Law through the Senate will allow parents with a high likelihood of having a child who will develop mitochondrial disease to be a step closer to choosing to undergo a procedure to replace the mitochondria that have a genetic abnormality with mitochondria from a donor egg.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After careful consideration, I have decided that I will be supporting this legislation. I have heard firsthand the experiences of families that have journeyed with the impact of mitochondrial disease, and I've had firsthand experience of children born with this disease too. I emphasise to the Senate that it is a significant, multisystemic and progressive disease. It can impact your heart, your muscles, your brain and much, much more. It leads to multiple-organ failure and can be deeply unpredictable in its nature. Indeed, the average life expectancy is between three and 12. It is clear from the evidence that has been presented to the multiple inquiries that have played an integral part in pulling together this piece of legislation that this is, without a doubt, a devastating, life-threatening disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that this bill as written commences with a stage 1, defined as a research and clinical trial phase. It is anticipated that this stage will take around 10 years. In speaking to parents, I have found it clear that, while there is hope in the passage of this bill, it is in its nature bittersweet for those who are wanting to reduce the likelihood of transfer now. This is especially true because mitochondrial donation has been legalised in the United Kingdom since 2015, with the first donation procedures occurring in 2018. For this UK example, assessments were completed on parents carrying mutations on a gene that would cause a rare mitochondrial disease called MERRF syndrome. This syndrome can be devastating and neurodegenerative in its nature. It is a disorder that worsens over time, often resulting in early death after the person loses muscle control and experiences dementia. Examples like this are exactly why we must commence making this procedure available to those who need it as soon as it is safe to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to ensure that funding for rare diseases continues to be made available. The Greens support ensuring that people with rare conditions, including mitochondrial diseases, are provided with wraparound healthcare services—for the person with the disease, their family and their support network. I call on the government to prioritise funding for research, including resourcing organisations that are doing much of the heavy lifting in this area, particularly the Mito Foundation. I am proud, in making this speech tonight, to be wearing a pin in solidarity with the foundation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will close by thanking the many people who have campaigned for and enabled this change. Getting to this point has been many years in the making. Those passionate about this matter participated in the 2018 inquiry into the science of mitochondrial donation, the National Health and Medical Research Council community consultation in 2019-20, and the Department of Health process early in 2021. When supporting someone through a significant illness or experiencing one ourselves, it can feel as though change is slow and hard to come by. Today is one of those historic moments when the community and its collective voice have been heard by people in this place and we get the opportunity to take a major step forward together.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, which is before the chamber. In July of last year the World Health Organization released a report detailing some of the ethical concerns raised by genetic interventions such as mitochondrial DNA donation. The report presented a number of important questions with regard to this new technology, questions such as: Who should have access to it? Who should make and enforce regulations for human gene editing? Indeed, should we be editing the genetic make-up of humans at all? These are some of the questions which were presented, and they're also questions with which we are presented here in the Senate today as we discuss and debate this bill in greater detail—the same questions that we are each seeking to find answers to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no denying that these questions are, for most, deeply personal. The views of both advocates and opponents are often informed by their own lived experiences, some of them traumatic, and by their values and their faith. Let me, at the outset, state that I respect all these views. Whilst my own personal decision as to how I vote on this issue may be different to what others might wish for, I hope that together we can all recognise the validity of other people's decisions and that which informs them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, for the most part, two different techniques that can be employed to facilitate mitochondrial DNA donation: pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer. The pronuclear transfer involves the creation of two embryos from which parts of each will be removed to then create a third, with the first two being disposed of. The maternal spindle transfer, on the other hand, uses a separate process which avoids the destruction of two embryos but also involves three genetic parents and the associated difficulties of a threefold shared linage. The instrumentalisation of the human embryo in this way, the use of a human embryo merely as part of a production process, is a proposition that we as a society must consider if we are comfortable with. It is the ethical challenge which is before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, we still don't know everything about mitochondrial donation. The science behind it is complex and makes it difficult to determine whether this technology is currently completely safe and effective. As with many other new medical technologies, the risks associated with mitochondrial donation are still unknown. Many scientists and clinicians suggest there are too many questions around mitochondrial donation that still need answering. Indeed, one might suggest that the divisive nature of this subject is proof enough that we may be pushing the boundaries of nature beyond a morally acceptable level, especially when the consequences are potentially so severe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I share concerns about this technology and I hold concerns about what it does, what it might do and what it means for us as human beings to employ this technology in the way that this bill as currently drafted would propose we should do. While it's true that mitochondrial donation has the capacity to create inheritable changes in DNA that could have significant benefits in the prevention of a disability or a disease, we're also confronted with the many questions which I alluded to earlier. At what cost do we decide to forego legitimate ethical concerns? Surely it is incumbent upon us to acknowledge the unknown impact of some of these changes? There's the inability of future generations to provide consent to these changes and the implications of altering a person's genetic composition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not know how much mitochondrial DNA is transferred from the mother's affected eggs during the process of mitochondrial donation. Studies have shown incidence of carryover of mitochondria from the woman with mitochondrial DNA disease into the reconstructed embryo, presenting a potentially new risk factor for mitochondrial DNA disease in the child. In fact, mitochondrial DNA carried over from the woman with the DNA disease may have a greater chance to replicate than donor mitochondrial DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also unclear whether mitochondrial donation could result in significant changes to the development of the embryo in comparison to normal embryo development. Whether the nucleus transferred from the mother's egg must adapt to the donor's egg is still being investigated—specifically, whether this adaptation could compromise the reconstructed egg's development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also debate as to whether compatibility between the nuclear and the mitochondrial DNA is important. Some studies have shown a mismatch could compromise metabolism and overall health, but, again, there is still very limited data available. With so many questions yet to be answered, how could we, in good conscience, approve of such an intervention?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering this bill, the Senate must also have regard to the interests and wellbeing of the people who will be born from mitochondrial donation. What consideration is given to the rights of the child? Those born as a result of the donation have no say in the procedure or the consequences that follow it. The experimental nature of mitochondrial donation is likely to necessitate continual follow-up over the child's life span. Whilst this is true of many medical interventions, is it fair to expect this of someone who's had no say in how they were brought into this world?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Information relating to the health and wellbeing of a person born from mitochondrial donation and of future generations is still required to better understand the science. However, this information cannot be gathered unless families also provide consent to follow up. Prospective parents have a choice. They have a choice in their pursuit of conceiving a child. They do so on behalf of someone who is yet to be born. One might argue that the child will simply be grateful to be born, but there is no way to know whether the child may feel conflicted as their personal beliefs and values develop over time. Will they feel comfortable knowing that their parents made a decision that has or could have severely compromised their existence? How will this impact the child's relationship with their parents?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The social implications of mitochondrial donation are also significant. Beyond their immediate family, would the child want to know or foster a relationship with the mitochondrial DNA donor? It is true that the contribution of DNA from the donor is very small. However, this does not detract from the fact that it took three parents to bring the said child into the world. The genetic relationship between an egg donor and a child born from mitochondrial donation is extremely complex. I don't think anyone in this place would argue against that. An egg donor's nuclear DNA would not be present in the child, as only mitochondrial DNA would remain in the implanted embryo. However, if one or both parties were to value the donated mitochondrial DNA differently, it could be cause for major distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consideration must also be given to the status of the embryo. Some, such as I, firmly believe that life begins at conception, and the process of mitochondrial donation involves the use and destruction of human embryos, a morally significant component in the creation of new life. As the earliest stage of development in a human being's life, an embryo should be considered precious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we already have assisted reproductive technology in the form of IVF. The use of IVF with egg donation is an option which is already legal and allows parents to be able to have the opportunity to have a child without the risk of the child having mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial donation is distinct from the traditional IVF, as it involves a third party in the production of an embryo. Using IVF to produce embryos that result in the birth of a child is one thing, but, if mitochondrial donation were to be approved in Australia, it would involve the creation of embryos with no intention of fostering life first. Instead, embryos would be used for a scientific purpose that involves experimentation on and destruction of a morally significant component of human life. This is already evidenced in the United Kingdom, where, despite the procedure having been legal for five years and the regulating authority having already approved pregnancy, there are yet to be any reported live births resulting from the mitochondrial donation technique.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 make it an offence to create for the purposes of reproduction a human embryo that contains the genetic material of more than two people. They also specify that it is an offence to create for the purposes of reproduction a human embryo that contains heritable changes to the genome. Mitochondrial donation involves both interventions. Legislators passed these laws to prohibit such interventions because the consensus back then was that they were inherently wrong. Legislation was passed under the premise that interventions of this nature cannot and should not be justified irrespective of the good intentions that may motivate such interventions. Performing one of these procedures would be a serious breach of these established ethical boundaries. We must question why these boundaries should no longer be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sympathise with prospective parents wanting to use mitochondrial donation to have a healthy child. Who doesn't want to have a healthy child? However, just because we can do something does not mean that we should, nor does it mean it is ethical. The reality of this decision is that there are no no-harm options. We must inevitably make a decision on where the harm will fall. Allowing mitochondrial donation through pronuclear transfer would involve creating human embryos with an intent to destroy them, turning them into a therapeutic product that degrades and strips them of inherent human dignity. We must question what precedent this process would establish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a crossroads with this decision here in the Senate. As the genetic manipulation of our own evolution has never precisely been possible, the power genetic molecular biology research and technology has bestowed upon us should not be taken lightly, as we have the capacity to shape the future of humanity from its earliest stages of development. Stepping down this path would permit us to take over our own genetic evolution. This is a reality that I struggle to feel comfortable with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, known as Maeve's Law. Before I outline to the Senate my thoughts on this bill, and I indicate here that I will be opposing this bill on moral grounds, I think it's worth reflecting on the mature and sober manner in which this debate has been conducted not just here—and that was a terrific contribution by my colleague Senator Raff Ciccone—but also over in the House of Representatives. A conscience vote has been exercised by both parties for the consideration and amendment of this bill, and so it should have been. It is good that this is happening. While the debates and shenanigans in parliament can border on or even enter into the pantomime, Australians should rest assured that when it comes down to it, although democracy can be messy, it is of course the best form of government and it gets things done. Reading and listening to speeches on both sides of this debate has been very insightful. We've seen the unique position where there are some on the other side agreeing with others on this side and vice versa. It's great to see this happen. You can't always say that about political speeches. They don't always bring the very best out in this sort of occupation, but this bill is different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated before, I will be opposing this bill. While I appreciate its intention and honour those that have lobbied for it, this bill presents some serious moral issues to me, and I do not believe that the appropriate safeguards are there and have been enacted to prevent the worst excesses of this science. I do, however, note and endorse the amendment that was passed in the House of Representatives preventing sex elective procedures. This is a good and vital amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time I'll pause to acknowledge the many people that have reached out to me, particularly those from the Mito Foundation, family members and friends and communities that have been touched by this disease. I can't imagine what it's like to get the news that your child has inherited this gene and is suffering from this disease. As a parent, obviously you want the best for your children. To get that sort of news must be absolutely heartbreaking, and I know you'd do everything you can for your children. For potential parents finding out they're carriers of the gene, there may be trauma and difficulty in hearing a speech like this, when all you want to do is to be able to have a child of your own. I acknowledge that and accept that. My position on this bill might not be the kind of support that you would love to have had. I do respect that and appreciate that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to the member for Menzies, the Hon. Kevin Andrews. Sadly, he's going to be leaving parliament at the end of this term, but he's left a wonderful legacy. One of the things that he did recently in the other place was contribute a number of amendments that I think, had they passed, would have made a significant contribution to this bill and made it a much more balanced, acceptable bill. If we had amendments such as those—and I believe that similar amendments might have been foreshadowed to come into this place—I would certainly be considering them and more than likely passing them, if they were in the same form as many of those amendments in the House of Representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, the fundamental biological truth of two parents coming together to create a child is not one that I could vote to alter. Comparisons to organ donation are disingenuous, as it does not result in DNA being passed on. Speaking in the other place, the member for New England, the Deputy Prime Minister, put it well. I'm sure he won't mind me quoting him verbatim here:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there's not a parabola of rights where at certain ages through your life you have absolute rights and then they dwindle towards the end and they dwindle towards the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This very much echoes my position. The idea that a life, or what could amount to a life, is created simply to be harvested and destroyed seems dystopian and wrong to me. Despite what good may come from it, there are always ways that technology could be deployed to really interfere with that. Despite the best intentions of this bill, it will eventually create embryos with the genetic material of three adults while destroying another embryo or zygote. It is for this reason in particular that I cannot support this bill. The idea of using three embryos simply as a source of genetic materials is anathema to me, as someone who believes that life does begin at conception. Were the amendments preventing this type of procedure passed, then perhaps this bill could have been considered differently. Two of the five methods outlined in the bill do not require the destruction of embryos and zygotes, and I hope that research will focus on this area. But I do, of course, still have that issue around three genetic parents impacting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that, although this technology has been legalised in the United Kingdom for roughly five years, there have not been any viable births as a result. It's not as if this technology's widely embraced around the world and is providing results. It's banned in many jurisdictions. The United Kingdom has also not released any data on the efficacy of the project, and this causes me concern. I was involved in a briefing by experts in this area, and it was a question that was raised. They couldn't provide the data, citing privacy reasons. It might be that there are a few people who have actually engaged in this and, while their identity might not be revealed to me directly if they released the data, of course sometimes by just releasing data you can potentially breach the privacy of those individuals who have participated in such a program. It really concerns me; we're trying to make a decision on whether the efficacy of this program justifies a change in law, and not having that data means I can't have any confidence that we're doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there have been reports of this procedure producing viable births in Mexico and in the Ukraine, neither of these two countries has explicitly legalised the technique and no medical journal has ever verified it. The World Health Organization has also cautioned against editing the human genome in a way that can be passed on to future generations, while the United States has outlawed mitochondrial donation trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not understand the need for Australia to rush into this area of medical research. Concerningly, contained within the legislation are immunities from civil liberty for ministers and civil servants. This kind of implies some uncertainty around the long-term effects of the procedure. While I genuinely support the attitude of 'at your own risk', this raises some serious questions over informed consent in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank those on both sides who have put their thoughts forward in a respectful and well-intentioned way, and certainly those who are advocating strongly for this for the way they have approached us. We don't always get approached on issues—I'm sure my colleagues can attest to this!—in such a respectful, collegiate and responsible way. But those involved in this topic have certainly conducted themselves well, and I very much appreciate the time and effort that's been put in by them. I have given careful thought to this and I expect that the bill will pass, probably on a similar ratio to what we saw in the House of Representatives. The bill will pass with or without my support. But, that being said, for the reasons I've outlined here today I cannot support it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  I don't intend to speak on the provisions of this bill; other speakers have already explained in detail how they work. I also don't intend to speak about the arguments in favour of the bill; these have been very well canvassed and will no doubt be explored much further. Instead, I want to talk about love. It's not something we often discuss in this chamber but it lies at the heart of so much of what we do. As senators, there are issues and policies we advocate for because they are sensible or rational solutions to problems that exist. But there are other things we advocate for—things we champion out of love, things that are very much close to our hearts, things we desperately want to see done, things that give us a reason to be here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are debating today, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, is not a matter of love for everyone. Some will vote with their heads. Some will vote based on their religious beliefs. And some will vote with their hearts. But this bill is certainly a labour of love for some—some senators, some members of the other place and, most importantly, some Australians whose lives have been touched by mitochondrial disease. They want to see a relatively small change in law but one with massive ramifications for those trying to understand, treat and prevent mitochondrial disease. Their motivation is not personal gain—far from it. Their motivation is not fame or fortune. Their motivation is simply to reduce the amount of incredible and needless suffering in this world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That change would allow for changes to be made to the human genome. I appreciate there are those, particularly in some religious circles, who do not think this is appropriate. Their view is that this is not a utilitarian matter—not a question of cost and benefits but a matter of principle and duty. I can see how that fits with their beliefs, their values and their ethics, but there are some moral issues where the pros so outweigh the cons. This is very much one of them. Mitochondrial donation is a very important issue that this chamber needs to deal with and deal with in this sitting period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2018, I participated in the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the science of mitochondrial donation. It was one of the most powerful and gut-wrenching hearings I've been involved with. What I heard and what I learned has stayed with me for many years. Mitochondrial disease is not just a medical condition. It's not like flu or a scraped knee. It's not a mild irritant that will soon pass. It is a death sentence. Think about that for a moment. It is a death sentence—no doubt about that at all—which is delivered before a child takes even his or her first breath. It's a death sentence which will only come after months, years or even decades of distress, pain and suffering. It's a death sentence which condemns families to anguished lives from seeing their child live the worst possible life. It's a death sentence which leaves bereaved mothers unable to conceive out of fear that the same tragic fate awaits their next child. I simply cannot imagine anything worse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot imagine the amount of suffering, anguish and pain this awful disease imposes on people. It affects many people; potentially one in 5,000 Australians is born with mitochondrial disease and serious health implications. That is a staggering number of people who face staggering pain. If we can do something to reduce the scale of this suffering or even to prevent it entirely, we have an absolute moral obligation to do so. I heard the arguments and read the objections in the 2018 inquiry, but, to be completely honest, I cannot accept them. I cannot accept there is a system of ethics or morality, rational or spiritual, which accepts this amount of suffering as acceptable. Certainly, it cannot be a system based on love because love is the antithesis of suffering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I most certainly will be supporting this bill. I ask every other senator listening to this to think seriously about what they love and who they love and to ask themselves, if it were their child, or their grandchild who was suffering from mitochondrial disease, whether they would not give everything they have to make this change to ease that suffering.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">tor BILYK</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I'd like to start my contribution on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 by thanking Shelley Beverley, a young woman living with mitochondrial disease who met with me and shared her story. Shelley's story is a perfect example of the devastation that mitochondrial disease causes. As a genetic disease, those who live with it are likely to see its impact not only on themselves but on multiple family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shelley lost her mother in 2016 after she experienced heart failure, muscle weakness and fluid on her lungs. Her brother died the following year, a few weeks short of his 35th birthday, after experiencing seizures and stroke-like symptoms. He had also suffered from migraines, vomiting and hallucinations. Shelley herself has experienced many horrific symptoms, including hearing loss, muscle weakness and diabetes. She also has a high risk of heart failure. She regularly visits a range of specialists, and the disease has put incredible pressure on her career, finances and family. Adding to this pressure is the constant fear that, like her mother and brother, her life may be cut short by this awful disease. Shelley and her partner have a strong desire to have a happy, healthy child. If you want to read Shelley's story in more detail, it's available on the Mito Foundation website. For me, meeting with Shelley has given me a very personal and a very human perspective on what is an otherwise technical, clinical and ethical debate. And there are thousands more Australians with similar tragic stories to tell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening who are not familiar with mitochondrial disease, I'll just take a few minutes to explain what it is. The disease gets its name from the complex tiny organelles that cause it, mitochondria. Mitochondria reside in our body's cells. They provide our cells with the energy they need to power their biochemistry. You could say mitochondria are the batteries of our cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is passed down through generations as the organelle replicates inside our cells. Children inherit mitochondria from their mother, as they reside in the mother's egg during conception. As such, the genetic risk for mitochondrial disease is always passed down from mother to child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease occurs when the body's cells contain mitochondria with faulty DNA. This leads to the cells not receiving the energy they need to function, and as a result they start to break down. Just going back to the battery analogy, if a battery is faulty, the machine it is running loses power and dies. It is this process of the cells dying from lack of energy that leads to the devastating symptoms of mitochondrial disease. Around one in 200 people carry the genetic risk for mitochondrial disease, but one in 5,000 will be born with mitochondrial disease or disorders that lead to severe illness. There is no cure; prevention is the only option. While some people with mitochondrial disease go on to lead full and relatively normal lives, a particularly tragic outcome is that many sufferers do not survive childhood or even infancy. Around 50 babies a year are born with severe mitochondrial disease. Many of those children will die before their fifth birthday, and my conscience says to me: if I can stop one of those children dying, I will do my utmost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By identifying carriers, it is possible to stop it from being transmitted. Sadly, this presents another cruel outcome of the disease: that a carrier cannot have children without the risk of passing it on. But this problem can be overcome with the mitochondrial donation IVF technique. This procedure provides an opportunity for women with mitochondrial disease to have children who are genetically similar to them but without passing on their mitochondria and, therefore, without passing on the disease. This bill will legalise this procedure and provide the appropriate regulatory framework for it. As such, the bill offers the possibility of allowing carriers to have children while, once and for all, eliminating this disease so that future generations do not have to suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation is an assisted reproductive technology procedure in which nuclear DNA from the egg of a birth mother who carries the genetic risk for mitochondrial disease is inserted into a donor egg which is then combined with the father's sperm. The resulting child will inherit the nuclear DNA of their mother and father and the mitochondrial DNA of the egg donor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2018 Senate inquiry explored a wide range of issues related to mitochondrial donation, and this was followed by an extensive community consultation in 2019 and 2020 conducted by the National Health and Medical Research Council, or the NHMRC. Both inquiries did an excellent job of exploring the scientific, social, moral and ethical considerations that go into whether to allow mitochondrial donation and the associated regulatory considerations. As a result, senators have an abundance of well-considered information that has been brought together through broad consultation to inform our positions on the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there are senators in this place who hold moral, ethical or religious objections to this procedure, and I respect their opinion. As long as the senators have thought through these issues thoroughly and deeply, I appreciate the effort they have put in regardless of the conclusions they come to. For me personally, through my careful consideration of these issues, the case for legislative change is abundantly clear. I don't intend in my contribution to thoroughly explore the full range of issues outlined in the NHMRC's report or the Senate inquiry. I will, however, outline a couple of the key objections to this technique and respond to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One argument against legalising the procedure is that it's unnecessary. As the argument goes, parents have other options available to them, such as adoption or fostering, and a strong parenting bond can form with their child even though the child is not closely genetically related to them. The same argument, of course, could be applied to all parents accessing assisted reproductive technology, including ART procedures that are already lawful and regulated. And, just as an aside, in Tasmania there was one child adopted last year. So, if people need to adopt a child, it's not as easy as just getting your name on a list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I and, I believe, society reject the view that parents who find it difficult, for whatever reason, to conceive by natural means should be denied the opportunity that is available to other parents. People living with mitochondrial disease should not face this discrimination on top of all the struggles and challenges this disease already presents. Even if we put aside the question of whether parents should be able to have genetically similar children, adoption and fostering, as I've said, may not be viable options. As was noted in the Senate inquiry, adoption and fostering programs have strict eligibility criteria, including health screening, and this counts them out as an option for parents with mitochondrial disease. Should mitochondrial donation be permitted in Australia, it may be the only viable pathway for women with mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another common objection is the argument that this technique is a dangerous new experiment creating three-parent babies. Related to the three-parent argument is the argument put by some that children born by this technique will be confused about their parentage. The term 'three-parent baby' is an emotive term, but it's not accurate. The reality is that a child born under this technique inherits their nuclear DNA and, therefore, their genetic characteristics from two parents. The mitochondrial DNA contributed by the egg donor makes up about 0.1 per cent of the total DNA inherited. Even so, it would not have any effect on the child's appearance, personality or a range of other features. In fact, the only noticeable difference it will make to the child is that they will be free of mitochondrial disease. In practical terms, the child will have two biological parents and will grow up knowing and loving those parents. There is no reason to regard the egg donor as a parent at all. They are no more a parent than any other donor of bodily products, such as a blood donor or an organ donor. I've chosen to address two of the key arguments against this bill. There are, obviously, more arguments, but they're the two that I really wanted to respond to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say, as I come to my conclusion, that I really appreciate the phenomenal amount of work that has gone into this bill, particularly from the health minister, Mr Greg Hunt, and the shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler. I also want to acknowledge Mr Butler's predecessor, Mr Chris Bowen, who has also studied and consulted extensively on this issue and with whom I had very informative discussions about mitochondrial donation when it was first raised with me. The other person I would really like to thank is Mike Freelander, the member for Macarthur, a paediatrician of about 40 years experience who I also sought information from. I found him so helpful in those discussions. Again, I want to thank Shelley Beverley for her strong advocacy and for sharing her story with me and explaining what this legislative change means for her and her family. Finally, I would really like to thank the Mito Foundation, whose representatives have also spoken to me and strongly advocated for this bill on behalf of the thousands of Australians living with mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been several years since the parliament and the government started exploring the option of legislating to allow mitochondrial donation. Australians living with this disease have waited far too long for a regulatory framework to catch up with the advances in medical technology. But we have the opportunity to allow women carrying the genetic risk for mitochondrial disease to have biological children without the fear of passing on the disease. Parties across both chambers have granted their members and senators a conscience vote on this issue, and I have no hesitation in supporting it. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

This bill would legalise research that remains experimental, with no accurate predictions of outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondria are tiny parts of a cell that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions and are part of our DNA. I empathise with those parents who are identified as potentially at high risk of transferring this genetic disorder to their future children. There are high risks to those children born out of the proposed experiments and a high risk of end-of-life scenarios if the experiments fail in utero or before that point. This is risky. The bill contemplates the use of multiple techniques, which may be addressed under licence, to achieve pregnancy after genetic intervention. The intention is to intervene genetically, with the outcomes permanent across future generations, by removing identified offending genetic content. One problem is that future generations may be affected by other, as yet unidentified, changes—unknown at this stage—that are permanent. Irrespective of what some say, this bill is promoting gene editing, a practice that should be discouraged, as it goes beyond therapy. It will not help any people with mitochondrial disease—not one. There are many alternatives for achieving parenthood for the couples identified as at high risk of passing on mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of specific problems with the bill, some of which I'll now highlight. There's been a clear failure to involve independent, unbiased persons in the decision-making process. The regulator, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, is excluded under the bill—excluded—without adequate explanation from any consultation role in issuing a licence for experimentation. That's a big concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill puts limits on the extent to which information shall be reported. Why, especially when it's experimental? There remains no feedback on the effectiveness of experimental procedures carried out in the United Kingdom, where experiments similar to those proposed here were legalised in 2015. To say that the failure to report back on the outcomes of experiments conducted in the United Kingdom over a six-year period is only because of privacy issues is somewhat fallacious. I ask: is the real reason for the failure to report back that there have been no successes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are serious deficits in the bill related to a lack of accountability for adverse outcomes of the experiments. What's to happen to human tissue when there is failed embryo development? There are indemnities from liability for virtually all involved in the activities if something goes wrong. Where's the accountability, the scrutiny, for an experiment? There are no ways for a child born out of the experimental procedures to be compensated for injuries, negative conditions or loss stemming from the experimental activities. There is no accountability for those who would intervene and experiment with living human beings. That's wrong, and I cannot support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to commend Senators Deb O'Neill and Matt Canavan for their considered amendments, which would ensure both scrutiny and accountability. We will support their amendments. I remain very concerned about this bill and the potential lack of respect it shows for the nature of being human, the lack of respect for human dignity and the lack of respect for the way we value people.</span>

The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 proposes amendments to the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002, the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002, the Research Involving Human Embryos Regulations 2017, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Therapeutic Goods (Excluded Goods) Determination 2018.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have heard from previous contributions, the successful passage of this bill would make mitochondrial donation legal in Australia and allow permitted mitochondrial donation techniques under a specified mitochondrial donation licence for research and training purposes in clinical settings. This bill was introduced to the House of representatives on 24 March last year and was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the same day. As chair of this committee, I would like to begin by thanking all submitters and witnesses to the inquiry for their input, and I acknowledge that the bipartisan committee report made no recommendations, simply noting that we were aware that all parties would allow a conscience vote in the parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maeve's Law has the ultimate goal of assisting women with mitochondrial disease to have a biological child who will not inherit their predisposition to this severe and life-threatening disease. It allows for further research and training into mitochondrial donation to build up Australia's evidence base, expertise and data on the safety and efficacy of donation techniques before allowing them to be introduced more broadly. The bill also proposes creating a mitochondrial donor register to store details about people born using mitochondrial donation, with those people able to find out the identity of their mitochondrial donor once they turn 18.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondria are small structures in human cells that produce 90 per cent of the energy the body needs to function. These structures contain DNA which can be passed on from a mother to her child through the mitochondria present in the mother's egg cells. Mitochondrial disease is a complex group of inherited conditions that can impact on health and life expectancy. In some cases, this disease can be fatal. The disease itself is caused by mutations in a person's mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA, impacting on the ability of their mitochondria to function properly. Common symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, vision and hearing loss, organ failure, heart problems and, in severe cases, premature death. Around one in 200 Australians are estimated to be predisposed to mitochondrial disease, with around 56 children born each year with a severe form of the disease. There is no known cure for mitochondrial disease, and treatment options are limited for managing symptoms, although there is significant research and clinical practice being undertaken in trying to identify a cure or find potential treatments to alleviate the condition.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to prevent some instances of the disease by legalising mitochondrial donation. The hope is that, when in used in conjunction with IVF, the process may allow women whose mitochondria would predispose their children to the disease to have a biological child that doesn't inherit the condition. Mitochondrial donation involves the transfer of nuclear genetic material extracted from a mother's egg to a donor egg that has had its own nuclear genetic material removed but retains its own mitochondria. This procedure was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2015 following extensive public consultation and several comprehensive scientific reviews of safety and efficacy. However, only one clinic in the UK is licensed to provide this treatment to eligible women and, at this stage, no formal data has been released on the outcomes of the treatment. It is our understanding that possibly up to 21 couples have attained a licence to receive the treatment and up to eight treatments have been approved, although the success or otherwise of these treatments has not yet been released publicly due to privacy reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into mitochondrial donation and the resulting National Health and Medical Research Council community consultation during 2019 and 2020 identified some community support for legalising mitochondrial donation in Australia but also highlighted significant ethical issues. These issues included concerns that such donations would result in three-parent children or genetic modification. In February last year the Department of Health released a public discussion paper around introducing mitochondrial donation in Australia in two stages, with this bill designed to support this implementation. The first stage would allow lab based research and training, followed by a trial with some families at one Commonwealth funded clinic. This trial is intended to determine the safety, efficacy and feasibility of mitochondrial donation technology. If the trial is successful, the second stage of implementation will allow the treatment to be made available more broadly. At that point—which, according to the Department of Health, is not expected to occur for possibly 10 years—it is proposed that this progression be subject to a further decision by the Australian government through the issuing of a new regulation by the minister. Despite being disallowable by the parliament, this approach does concern me. Should legislation be passed to implement stage 1, I believe it is vital that the parliament undertake a full and comprehensive review of the trials before finalising the final stage of progressing to clinical practice through legislation at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first made aware of this legislation, my daughter was expecting my first grandchild. My initial thoughts were that, like IVF, this is yet another form of scientific development that will assist young people to have a healthy family. I wondered how I would feel if my daughter had been in the situation of those mothers who have the mitochondrial mutation and go into each pregnancy wondering if they'll pass it on to their newborn child. I could relate to their predicament, and, on first reflection, I thought it likely that I would support the bill. However, through the committee inquiry process, I have come to have a better understanding of what is before us. The proposed donation techniques, the limited amount of international research to date, the fact that no known successful births have eventuated after five years of research being under taken in the UK and the fact that, in some cases, embryos are created, harvested and disposed of as part of the research made me realise I could not support the bill as proposed. I was pleased to note that several government amendments were agreed in the House of Representatives that have increased the level of reporting and removed the ability of selection by parents as part of the research. I also understand that further amendments will be moved in the Senate in relation to the variation mitochondrial donation techniques included in the bill and the progression to clinical practice licences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Various submitters and witnesses to the inquiry, as well as further consultation that I've undertaken since, have stressed that, in the case of a pronuclear transfer, the mitochondria transfer takes place at the zygote stage of a fertilised egg, shortly before it becomes an embryo. It results in two eggs being fertilised by the father's sperm and then the mitochondria from the donor's fertilised egg is transferred into the mother's fertilised egg, and the donor's egg or zygote is then discarded. I appreciate that there are various views on this. However, I believe that a zygote is the beginning of a new life. It already contains all 46 chromosomes that will exist throughout its development to an embryo and on to the birth of a baby and on to adulthood—if given the chance to do so. I do not support the post-fertilisation techniques included in the bill. The maternal spindle transfer method of mitochondrial donation is, to me, the only ethical technique proposed—involving the transfer of the donor's egg's mitochondria into the mother's egg prior to fertilisation and the development of the zygote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of concern relates to the impact of genetic manipulation on future generations. As stated by the member for Tangney in his second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill reverses the longstanding prohibition on heritable human genetic manipulation. Mitochondrial donation allows changes to the heritable genetic information of a child and will affect that child, their children, their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren and the many generations to come. That's why it's important to make sure that the provisions of this bill are considered with the utmost care and diligence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Menzies also touched on this in his second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some proponents suggest that the procedures are simply extensions of existing practices, such as organ transplantation and assisted reproductive technologies. I contend that this is not so. In organ transplantation, DNA is not passed onto future generations. In current reproductive technologies, neither human eggs nor human embryos are modified in the radical ways proposed in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that contribution, Mr Andrews went on to highlight that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The US Food and Drug Administration has taken the view that all forms of mitochondrial donation, whether using male or female embryos, constitute germline editing and has maintained its prohibition on clinical trials for this reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to take note of that decision and perhaps question why there is only one country globally that has granted licences for these mitochondrial donation techniques. Why is it that, to date, after five years of trials, there remains no evidence of a successful birth through mitochondrial donation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years ago the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator was established to provide oversight of any proposed gene modification techniques, yet this bill specifically excludes that office from having oversight of the proposed techniques. To me this makes no sense, and I believe we should ensure that the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, together with its Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee, does have the opportunity to review all aspects of the proposed mitochondrial donation techniques, in the same manner that it does for all other medical genetics proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex and sensitive issue, and I appreciate that there are real lives impacted by the decisions made in this place. My heart goes out to each person impacted by this disease, and I fully understand the desire and intent behind this legislation. Our responsibility is not just to the current generation but also to future generations, and we need to be assured that the final legislation, which I suspect is likely to pass despite the concerns that I've raised, offers the best protection for those to come. I therefore urge all senators to consider each amendment closely, to ensure that every possible safeguard is in place going forward.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:40</span>):  I'm very pleased to be able to make a contribution today on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, the purpose of which is to legalise mitochondrial donation for particular research, training and reproductive purposes. The bill also amends the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002. The bill also seeks to introduce many safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would first like to thank Dr Mike Freelander, the member for Macarthur, for providing me and other colleagues with his insights into the bill and for distributing the research paper on mitochondrial transfer produced by Oliver Hervir, an intern from ANU working in Mike's office. I also acknowledge the advocacy and determination of the Mito Foundation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From time to time, those of us entrusted to serve in this place have the privilege and the responsibility to be able to support meaningful change that has the potential to dramatically improve people's lives. The bill before us today is one such opportunity. Under the bill, mitochondrial donation will be introduced in a staged and closely monitored way. The first stage allows for certain research and training purposes, including the undertaking of a clinical trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us has been a long time in the making. It's been nearly five years since the production of the 2018 Senate Community Affairs References Committee report recommending that some further consultation should be undertaken with the community and relevant experts. In response to the Senate report, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC, undertook a series of community consultations to seek community attitudes to the ethical, legal and social issues associated with introducing mitochondrial donation in Australia. The NHMRC also convened an expert committee to review key scientific questions raised by the Senate inquiry. The NHMRC and the Senate inquiry identified significant community support for legalising mitochondrial donation for use in Australia. The consultation also identified concerns about the technology. In February 2021, the health department released a public discussion paper seeking feedback on a proposed two-stage implementation approach. Public consultation, which concluded in March 2021, identified support for the proposed approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The change that this bill seeks to make is significant, but, in my view, it's a change that we, as the parliament, should endorse. The change will make a big difference to families. It's been a long time coming, as I've said, and I'm sure many passionate advocates are listening in today, filled with much emotion. Today, I hope, is your day. I hope that, at the conclusion of this debate, you'll be able to celebrate a well-deserved achievement. I'm sure you were as heartened as I was when the bill passed the House of Representatives with a significant margin—92 votes to 29.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, this bill has been appropriately dubbed 'Maeve's Law'. I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to a brave and special young girl, Maeve Hood, and her family. As we know, Maeve was diagnosed with a severe type of mitochondrial disease, Leigh syndrome, at 18 months of age. Maeve's mum and dad, Sarah and Joel, have been tireless advocates for the law reform needed to allow for the use of IVF technology that can prevent mitochondrial disease. This advocacy will have undoubtedly taken its toll. It's never easy talking so frequently about something so personal, more so about someone you love, especially your own child. I would like to pay tribute to them and acknowledge their pivotal role in making this much-needed change happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they're not the only ones. There are so many people—parents and their children—in the Australian community who have experienced the ravages of a rare genetic disease and who have shared their stories to bring this issue to the attention of policymakers. Your passion, commitment and advocacy has meant something. It has led to this day. It has worked. The passage of this bill through this place will allow women to give birth without passing on a genetic disease. This will be enabled through making a mitochondrial donation process lawful. When necessary, a pregnant woman will be able to replace their own mitochondrial DNA with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor egg from another woman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been estimated that as many as 56 babies born each year in Australia could potentially be saved from inheriting mitochondrial disease with the passage of this legislation. Indeed, one Australian baby who will develop a severely disabling form of mitochondrial disease is born every week. That's according to the Mito Foundation, which works to enrich the lives of people with mitochondrial disease and has led much of the research, policy work and calls for law reform and funding to enable IVF mitochondrial donation. Sadly, most children diagnosed with mito die in the first five years of life. There is no cure and there is no real treatment. The Mito Foundation estimates that one in 200 people, or 120,000 Australians, carry the genetic change that puts them at risk of developing mito or passing it on to their children. This bill would dramatically change the lives of these Australians, should they have children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A series of amendments were made to this bill in the other place and were well received by advocates, the medical profession and the medical research profession. The amendments addressed concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills around what the committee saw as a lack of clarity in some provisions of the bill. The committee did not seek to change the function or intent of the bill. It is pleasing to see the government act constructively in pursuing these amendments to this bill, and I must acknowledge here the work of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mr Hunt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments agreed to in the House provide greater clarity and privacy protections without changing or impacting the intent or substance of the bill. In particular, the amendments clarify that donated mitochondria must be sourced from human eggs; expand and clarify the circumstances in which proper consent is needed before mitochondrial donation techniques are used; clarify the circumstances in which the Embryo Research Licensing Committee is able to seek expert advice when performing its statutory functions; enhance mitochondrial donor privacy through provisions relating to the register; and further enhance privacy by ensuring that the ERLC's statutory reports to parliament cannot disclose identifiable personal information. I welcome these changes, and I welcome this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of this bill provides Australian parents affected by mitochondrial disease with a choice to minimise the risk of their children inheriting this life-threatening disease. I will be voting for the passage of this bill to allow parents to have that choice, and I sincerely hope this bill is successful and becomes law. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:50</span>):  As the speakers before me have noted, this is an incredibly complex issue. I felt I had to rise and speak to this proposed legislation today, the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021, despite the fact that the issue of mitochondrial disease is not one that I have followed closely as many of my colleagues have. I have not met with families who have suffered from mitochondrial disease. I have not personally heard their anguish. But it's clearly a very important piece of legislation addressing some really complex issues. There have been so many concerns about mitochondrial donation that have been raised through various inquiries and stakeholder consultation activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one hand, we have families that are suffering the anguish, the trauma, the huge grief of having children born with mitochondrial disease who die, usually before they are five years old. We have the anguish of potential parents who don't know whether they want to go ahead with pregnancies because of potentially bearing a child that is going to suffer with mitochondrial disease. To be able to do something for these families is something that, yes, you would think this parliament should do. On the other hand, there are issues that have been raised about the risks, the rights of the child, future adults and future generations, issues with the creation and destruction of embryos, the creation of embryos from more than two people, the limited supply of donated eggs, donor rights and responsibilities, the fact that trial participants potentially were able to undertake sex selection following pre-treatment counselling, and the unintended or unknown consequences of manipulating or altering genetic material, which may lead to genetic engineering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there have now been numerous inquiries looking at all of these issues in all of their complexity. In particular, the most recent one, the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, noted that this is a matter of conscience. As that report said, it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… engages difficult ethical, social and scientific issues. The committee notes that the changes proposed are significant and that the bill would amend existing laws that strictly control embryo research and prohibit cloning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to really thank everyone who has engaged in the consideration of these issues. I want to thank the advocates for this bill who have been engaged in this space for a long time and who understand that nuance and complexity and have advocated for an approach that respects human life and fully recognises the powerful complexity of the processes that are involved. I particularly want to thank and recognise the families who live with mitochondrial disease and the Mito Foundation, who have been working on their behalf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank those who are taking a position not in support of this bill, because I think it's very important that they have been able to bring their concerns forward for us to consider. In particular, I want to thank Bob Phelps from Gene Ethics, who has been lobbying very hard against this bill and who has made me think long and hard and read a lot more about this issue and about this bill than I thought I was going to when we first started considering the issue. I think it's important that all of these issues are thoroughly canvassed and considered by all of us so we all grapple with these issues and all come to a decision, on balance, as to where we stand. Particularly, I thank Bob. I've worked with Bob for a long time on the issue of genetically modified organisms and I have a lot of respect for his passion for public policy that properly considers the risks of genetic modification, particularly, in this instance, of human genetic modification. I've been grappling, as all of us have, with working out where I stand on this. Where I have come to is that, on balance, the benefits of this bill outweigh the risks. Having heard and deliberated over evidence from multiple advocates on multiple occasions, I believe this legislation will provide meaningful and welcome change for people who suffer from mitochondrial disease. I believe the checks and balances in this legislation will significantly ameliorate the risks associated with these new techniques.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that this is not a straightforward, simple step to take. It involves changing legislation, and it's important to have really strong protections in place. I remain concerned about the lack of data from the UK trials. I think it would be a much easier position for us to take if we had data from those UK trials and if there were published literature saying, 'This is what the results of the trials have been.' I'm going to support this legislation. On balance, I think it is good legislation. It is going to have a lot of benefits for people who are suffering from mitochondrial disease. But I foreshadow that I have quite a bit of sympathy for the further amendments being proposed in this place that add some extra checks and balances to make sure we have a really good understanding of the science and, as the clinical trial goes on through the years, of how to make sure that we know that these are appropriate techniques and processes to carry on into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I thank those from across this parliament who have approached this complex debate constructively, and I look forward to hearing the debate during the committee stage about further amendments that could improve this legislation. On balance, however, I feel it is important legislation that should be passed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Que</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">ensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:57</span>):  At the start of my contribution to this debate on the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 I recognise that the desire to create a human life is perhaps the most fundamental human desire. There is something inbuilt, seemingly, in human beings that makes them want to have a child of their own to pass their legacy beyond their time in this world. I can deeply understand the desire of those in our community who are afflicted by mitochondrial disease to successfully have a child and raise it as their own. I am in the fortunate situation of having five children of my own with my wife. They are the greatest joy in my life, even though I sometimes joke that the only reason I had children was so I could have grandchildren. Again, the desire to pass on that genetic material is something I seemingly have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who are afflicted by mitochondrial disease in a severe fashion have a difficult choice to make about whether to have children because it is a disease that can be passed on genetically. I can't understand the angst that those people must go through because I do not have children or loved ones who are afflicted by this disease. I pay respects to those committed individuals who have for a long time advocated for these changes. I have seen some of the experiences that those families have been through and I acknowledge their great desire to see a solution to this terrible disease that they have been burdened with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I respect those efforts, I cannot support this bill for two main ethical considerations I have with its approach. The first of those is the inclusion in this bill of techniques that would seek to remove defective mitochondria in a way that, in my view, necessarily destroys life. I don't think we should ever seek to use a human life as an instrument or a tool to help someone else's life. I believe in the dignity and sanctity of each individual human life and that we should, to the extent that it is possible, strive and aim to protect each individual, sacred human life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this bill would approve two techniques that would result in the creation of zygotes, or embryos, with the purpose of using one of those zygotes—or, in my view, one of those lives—to help the other that has defective mitochondria, which would result in the necessary destruction of the mitochondrial donor life. The two techniques in this bill are the pronuclear transfer technique and the second polar body transfer technique. They are apparently, according to Dr Megan Best, similar to methods that are used in cloning. Because they result in the destruction of a life, I simply cannot support an approach that goes down this path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise there is a dispute about when a life begins. It seems to me that once conception occurs there is a continuum from that conception that involves the evolution of a human being. There is really no other distinct point that ethicists have identified which switches a zygote through to an embryo or to a later stage. There's no discontinuity there. There have been some artificial boundaries defined by human beings but there's nothing we can actually identify. I don't see 'at that point it's a zygote, at that point it's an embryo' myself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second ethical issue and concern I have with this bill—and it has been raised with others—is around removing the prohibition on transferring genetic material between two human beings. This would result in permanent changes to the human germline. There are a lot of things we do not know about these techniques and the ramifications of them. There can be, as we know from animal trials, mistakes and so-called off-target errors made in genetic modification. I do not think we are at a stage where we should overturn this prohibition, with so much still unknown about these techniques.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also concerned about the broader ethical considerations of using the same techniques approved in this bill to tackle other diseases or afflictions, or even, ultimately, to look at more heritable traits around attributes of height, strength and other things. I know this bill does not do that, but it is hard to separate here the development of these techniques from the ethical considerations of those broader applications that might occur once the techniques have been established.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of those ethical considerations, I can't support the bill as a whole. However, I would like to flag that I and others in this chamber will be moving amendments to tackle some of the ethical considerations I have. In particular, there is a specific amendment I propose to move that would remove the pronuclear transfer and second polar body transfer techniques—the ones that involve the destruction of a fertilised egg—from the bill and, therefore, deal with that ethical consideration I have. That amendment would still leave the maternal spindle transfer technique and the first polar body transfer technique as ways with which to make the mitochondrial donation that do not result in the creation of two fertilised eggs. In that case the donation would occur at the egg stage, before conception. That would therefore absolve that first ethical consideration I have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had another ethical consideration with the bill as it was originally drafted and proposed in the House. At that stage the bill provided for the approval to destroy any female embryos that were created from the mitochondrial donation methods. The rationale for that was that almost all mitochondria are acquired from the mother, so an added protection was originally there to allow parents going through this process to destroy the female embryos and therefore reduce any residual risk of mitochondria being transferred to their children. I thank the government for considering amendments that were previously drafted, and I also acknowledge the efforts of Mr Kevin Andrews in pushing those in the House. The bill has already been amended in the House to remove that, and I think it's sensible that we should not allow a form of sex selection to be approved or legalised in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendments I will seek to move don't completely ameliorate the ethical concerns I have but would, I think, go some way to providing greater oversight by parliament and other bodies on the development of these techniques if that is approved by this parliament. Originally, the bill only required a review after seven years. I again acknowledge the efforts of Mr Kevin Andrews, whose amendments have now inserted annual reporting into the bill. However, I flag that I would like to move further amendments that would require more detail in that annual reporting, including detail on the number of participants and any births that have occurred, in a de-identified and private way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments I will move also seek to remove the so-called stage 2 of this bill. This bill establishes a number of licences that are, if you like, ready to go—licences that involve further research and trials of mitochondrial donation. My amendments would not affect the three licences. However, two further licences are in the so-called stage 2 process, which would result in the clinical practical application and provision of mitochondrial donation services to the broader community. At this stage, as the bill outlines, there's no regulatory framework to govern the stage 2 licences, the clinical practice licences, because there's just too much we do not know at this stage about how that framework could work once the trials and research are concluded. I do not see a strong rationale for us to give preapproval, if you like, to these licences. This bill would allow the Minister for Health and Aged Care in the future to provide a regulatory framework for these licences through mere regulation rather than parliamentary legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a broader debate over the past couple of years in this house about the appropriateness of delegating legislation to ministers. I recognise the work of Senators Carr and Fierravanti-Wells, through the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, in highlighting the concern that there's too much legislation that is providing authority to ministers to effectively make laws through regulation, with more limited parliamentary oversight. Of course, some of these regulations can be disallowed in the future, but we all know that process is a much more limited one than the passage of legislation through committees and through the scrutiny of the two chambers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By removing stage 2 of the bill, what I propose is that, following the conclusion of research and trials, the government of the day, or any senator or member, would need to bring through additional legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the clinical practice elements of this bill. To me, it seems that that enhances our role and our job as senators, and the role of members in the other place, to provide proper parliamentary oversight over these novel and revolutionary techniques. Almost all contributors to this debate, both for and against, have recognised the uncertainties and unknowns associated with some of these technologies. To me, it seems absolutely appropriate that we walk down this path one step at a time and that we do not seek to jump over a level of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight here. So I'll be moving that amendment as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just quickly flag a few other amendments that I know some colleagues of mine will be moving; I will perhaps leave it to them to explain in more detail. I think this bill errs in exempting the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator from having oversight of these processes. Again, in a similar vein, these are novel and revolutionary approaches. We have a regulator established to deal with a lot of these issues, especially in regard to animal and plant life. It seems strange that the OGTR would be removed from the process here and that instead this bill would establish that the NHMRC Embryo Research Licensing Committee is the responsible body. I think we should be using the existing expertise in this area through the OGTR.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also flag that, should my stage 2 amendments fail and should stage 2 remain in the bill, I'll move amendments that seek to prescribe at least a minimum number of trial participants to go through the first stage before a stage 2 could be regulated by the minister. Finally, I don't see a strong rationale to exempt those providing these procedures from civil liability through these processes. That has not been explained to me in sufficient fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall I think this bill is an understandable reaction to a disease that is debilitating for many people. But we as senators, I hope, cannot allow that emotion to absolve us of the need to provide proper scrutiny of these techniques, which can have much, much broader ramifications for human development, the ethical treatment of life and the protection of what is the most sacred, fundamental human desire: to create another life and to protect, support and nurture that life.</span>

I want to commend all of those participants whose words I've heard already this evening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 is 'Maeve's Law'. It arises out of the experience of the frailty of the human condition in a particular person, young Maeve, around which this bill really is centred. If it's passed, this would be a landmark piece of legislation with very long-lasting consequences for health care in Australia. But I don't believe that it would enhance those health outcomes. In fact, as it's constructed, and at this point of time, it raises serious and profound questions about ethical issues of great importance, such as cloning, the sex selection of infants, children having three parents and germline tampering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a Labor senator brought up in the Catholic faith, and, with all the sinners alongside me in that church, I still take my moral guidance very significantly from a belief in the fundamental dignity of human life. My party, the Labor Party, seek to effectively govern and effectively participate in the parliament by binding on how we vote. There are very few occasions on which a conscience vote is enabled, but this is one of those pieces of legislation to which a conscience vote has been allocated. I acknowledge that it's not just through the language of faith that people come to a moral and ethical disposition, but the language of my faith and the teachings of my faith have significantly informed my views about the sanctity of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge one of my colleagues in the other place, Dr Mike Freelander, who has served the people of the Macarthur region for decades as a paediatric specialist before he came here. I know that he continues to serve in that public hospital at no charge, providing his service to the community. He's a man of great integrity—I'm very proud to serve alongside him—and he is supporting this piece of legislation. He has also been in a position where he has looked after children with mitochondrial disease, and I acknowledge his expertise. We hold very different views about what the action of this parliament should be with regard to this bill, but the conversations have always been very informative and very respectful. Again, that has characterised the debate to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I put out in a more linear form the rationale for my view, I want to acknowledge the advocacy of young Maeve Hood and her family. It's never easy to step into the hurricane that is national politics and attempt the long and slow process of political reform, but the Hood family have actually undertaken that with considerable grace and candour. Many families turn their grief and loss into profound activism. Maeve and her beautiful family, and other families like theirs, are in my prayers. I pray for their health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do know the suffering and grief of losing someone so young. It was not one of my own children. I am happily a mother to three now grown adults. But I can still remember just before my niece, Lucy O'Neill, was to turn four, having her on my hip at her pre-fourth birthday while she blew out her candles. She didn't quite make four. She died of liver cancer. I know families, so many of them, that have had young children die of brain cancer. That suffering is best translated into a positive effort, and that is what Maeve's parents have attempted to do here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are legislators and we need to think about what this bill will do and establish and the broadest good and the least harm that we can manage. This bill as it's currently constructed would legalise processes in Australia that currently carry large custodial sentences or fines. We are seeking to overturn law that if you acted against right now you would go to jail. The law is preventing the creation, for the purposes of reproduction, a human embryo that contains genetic material of more than two people or contains heritable changes to the genome. My fellow senators, we shouldn't have to change legislation to do ethical science. The process that we're considering here in this legislation is only legal in one other country in the entire world, and that is the United Kingdom. We are not even sure that the five years of research that have been undertaken with the carve-out that they created in their law has actually come up with anything at all that's approaching a success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have here beside me the report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that I served on that investigated this piece of legislation. We sought to inform ourselves about what's really going on. The committee made one recommendation, which was to make no recommendation as this is a conscience matter. The report simply summarised the submissions and views available at the time of reporting. We couldn't report any factual data or evidence despite five years in the UK of the program that is before us for consideration tonight, here in Australia. It's been going in the UK for five years and there is no data. There is no evidence. We can't see if there's been any progress at all because the way in which that legislation passed did not allow sufficient scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If time allows this evening, I will move the amendments that I have already advanced and that I think are available to senators. They were alluded to in comments by Senator Canavan. I've been speaking with colleagues throughout the day about my concerns and why we need to make amendments to what is before us. Even if the bill should pass, it should pass in a different form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not believe that Australia should become a society where people can have designer babies. That will not be the intention of those who seek to advance this legislation, but it could well and truly be the intention of somebody entrepreneurial—and I say that in the worst possible way—who sees the opportunity to make money for themselves at a cost to others that is beyond possible consideration. We shouldn't be thinking about enabling the construction of designer babies made to specifications where people tinker with an embryo to pursue a perfect child. I'm deeply troubled by the production of genetic material, the building blocks of life, to be casually discarded as by-products of a process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another relatively unknown implication of this legislation is that children born of this process will have three—not two but three—genetic parents: a father, a mother and the donor of the mitochondria. It's a very significant change and it's a new frontier for society. We need to acknowledge the novelty of this social change and the effects on any child growing up with this knowledge. We need to acknowledge the profound issues that this bill raises in terms of the moral, social, scientific, ethical and practical realities that it will enable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The techniques that are under consideration will have long-term, irreversible and unknown consequences for the germ line of those born following the treatment. That means that that child and all its descendants will carry unknown consequences to their children and their children's children. This will not end with one generation. It goes on and on, and we have not seen that before on this planet. Children of MRT are the first in human history to be genetically modified from the moment of their origin. Surely one day they will ask, 'Who am I?' in the most fundamental way that we ask ourselves as human beings: 'Who do I belong to? Who am I really like? Where does this bit of me come from? Who are my parents?' Perhaps a register of the donor will hold that information without error, in perpetuity, or perhaps it will be like everything else in our society—a little bit broken, at least. And where's the security? That's just for the holding of information, let alone the understanding of the deepness of our need to explore our identity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some senators will argue that this proposed path we're debating is the only way to address the very real impact that mitochondrial disease and the deaths of much-loved young Australians have on the people who know and love those young Australians. But what's being proposed in this bill is not really a solution to eliminating mitochondrial disease; it is an attempt to create a new way of interacting with the disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point out that, as Senator Canavan eloquently described at the beginning, the gift of actually being able to have children is something we all deeply understand, and people make choices for and against that. But it does concern me that there are options that are available to these mothers who want to have children without the mitochondrial consideration. There's the capacity to undertake IVF with a donor egg—even perhaps from a sibling, to get that genetic connection. There is the capacity to adopt. Both of those models are legal, exist within the law and don't ask us to change what we have currently outlawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is enacted, it is going to receive the benefit of 10 million of Australia's hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and the time and energy that it will draw will take people away from what I consider to be other, very pressing medical research that will have a much broader impact across the community. And that is our task as parliamentarians: to weigh up the relative merit, benefit and risk. There is merit and there is benefit, but there is extraordinary risk embedded in what we are considering here today. How many will this bill affect, compared to the advances that could be made in treating current diseases such as brain cancer in children or liver cancer in children under five?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's proposed here isn't a cure; it's a radical technology trial to enable a choice for those who would prefer their children to be genetically related to them but not carry the genetic disorder. I believe that the legislation on the experimental mitochondrial donation treatment is simply not worth the scale of the risk that is embedded in what is being put before us. Perhaps if we had more data from the UK that could underpin a solid assumption about the capacity of this initiative to work, I might be more inclined to give it some support, but that is not the case. We're literally flying blind here. This proposed treatment shatters decades of long consensus around experiments regarding human cloning and germline editing. We will, if this bill passes, create a new frontier in the use of cloning and gene editing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicate that I will have further comments to make when we get a little further along in this process, and there are three amendments that I've put before the Senate for consideration. The first goes to the need for the creation of evidence and data that can be observed, and that there is an experimental threshold where we should have at least 20 occasions on which this technology has been successful. The second goes to, before we advance, civil liability protections, and the third goes to the Gene Technology Act. I look forward to continuing the debate in the coming day.</span>

It causes a range of symptoms, including muscle and neurological problems with symptoms that can range from the mild to the severe, and sometimes it can prove fatal. Between one in 5,000 and one in 10,000 Australians will develop severe mitochondrial disease. For those individuals affected—Australians like Julian, Shelley, Rosie, Alana, Pippa, Kara, Dot, Marcus and so many more—the seriousness of the condition is only compounded by there being no cure at this stage. This bill offers hope to each of those people and their families, and that hope is so important. These people's lives matter. Every life matters. Yet those two short sentences carry with them the very difficulty of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021 sets out a legal framework for mitochondrial donation. In doing so it provides hope for a world without mitochondrial disease, but it does this by allowing in this country—we'll be only the second country in the world to permit it—five different experimental procedures, some of which require human life to be created and then destroyed during the donation process. That's why, after careful consideration of this bill and the procedures it allows, and with something of a heavy heart for those families who I know are looking for answers, I can't support it in its current form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation is not a cure for mitochondrial disease; it instead aims to prevent children inheriting the mitochondria that causes the disease. This is a really worthwhile goal. While mitochondrial donation is yet to lead to a successful birth—as I mentioned, the UK is the only country to have legalised the procedure to date—this on its own shouldn't be a deal-breaker. We all want Australia to be a leader in medical research because we all want Australians to get the best possible medical care. That inevitably that has to involve experimentation. But our desire for medical progress must be balanced against the nature of the research involved and the ethical ramifications of it for the rest of society. In the case of this bill I believe it ignores ethical implications in the hope that it will lead in time to viable medical treatments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial donation involves a permanent modification of the human germline. That's not germs as in bacteria, but, rather, a reference to genetics. The procedure involves combining the genetic material from two females in order for eggs and zygotes to be created without the genetic disease. A human embryo created through this process will contain, necessarily, the genetic material of more than two people. That is an ethical boundary that causes me concern. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons for wanting a treatment of this kind are completely understandable, particularly from those who carry the disease. It must be heartbreakingly difficult for those who desperately want to become parents but know they carry the gene. I can only say how much empathy I have for those in that position. But we're only in the very early stages of understanding the human genome. We have a limited understanding of genetics, and there's a real risk that our experiments will cause off-target effects—in other words, unintended consequences that occur due to editing the genome in the wrong place. The consequences of our actions won't only affect the child born through a successful procedure; it will affect all of their future descendants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to stop and think about the ethical threshold we may be about to cross. By allowing genetic manipulation to reduce disease, we are permitting genetic manipulation that could equally be used for a host of non-therapeutic purposes. It's not beyond contemplation that the science used in mitochondrial donation could be used for other, more troubling, purposes. These include editing the physical attributes of a child or creating human enhancements. I regard both of these as unethical, especially if human lives are created and then destroyed during the donation process in order to make it possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, as I understand it, potential methods by which mitochondrial donation may be able to be pursued without creating human lives solely to end them for the purposes of donation. I'm open to the pursuit of treatments that don't require such ethically troubling steps. I'm open to amendments that will enable treatments to be pursued for mitochondrial donation that don't involve the creation of embryos for their destruction. I remain troubled by the risks of the editing process and the use of the genes of more than two people to make a child. Ultimately, it's not right, in my view, for the life of one human to be prioritised over another, or used as parts for another. There is goodness in every human. There is dignity in every human, and there is the spark of the divine: unique talents, gifts and contributions to be made in every single human. That's why I can't, in good conscience, support this bill without amendments that adequately safeguard against these risks. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:33</span>):  Today I speak in favour of the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill. I know people consider this bill to be a test, in some cases, of their dearest convictions and closely held beliefs, and it certainly speaks to mine. The debates before us tonight have evolved over time, alongside human scientific discovery and our need to legislate ethical frameworks for science and, indeed, demand for and developments in reproductive technology. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I voted in the state parliament of Western Australia in the early 2000s to ban human cloning. It was important at the time, and there were debates about making genetic copies. It was, nevertheless, put forward at the time that it would be the role of the legislature to amend or change those preclusions based on changing the ethical framework in the context of new discoveries and ensuring continued scientific development in a proper scientific and ethical framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, the bill before us is not really about gene editing. That's not what we're doing here. It's about mitochondrial DNA and its donation. It's about DNA that comes from outside the nucleus, from which all our personal attributes come. In the case of this bill, I don't put an overemphasis on excess embryos or believe that it's like cloning or that it creates three-parent children. I don't believe it does, and, indeed, expert evidence demonstrates the same. This bill is about preventing painful and unnecessary death. It is not about legislation to prevent physical diversity or about designer babies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us will remember from school science class—for some of us, it's the only thing we've remembered!—that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. I don't know if you remember that from science class, but I certainly do. Mitochondria produce 90 per cent of the energy that the body needs to function. For people without proper mitochondrial material in their cells—can you imagine anything more difficult and horrifying?—it feels like you've got the flu all the time, with the utter pain that comes with that, only getting more and more extreme. It's not just a physical variation; it is a painful and catastrophic condition for many people, especially for young children who have a severe form of the disease. As part of an inherited condition, it lowers people's health and life expectancy. It's caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA in an individual. Although the number of people born with the disease is low, one in 200 people are estimated to be predisposed to mitochondrial disease and also to be carriers. Here today we have an opportunity to support reproductive science that prevents this cruel disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If mitochondrial donation is successful, it's not going to prevent all cases of the disease but, hopefully, over time, it might reduce its incidence in the Australian population. To use this technology you will of course have to know that you're a likely carrier and that you and your partner's genes will combine to create a child that has a high likelihood of the disease, so it won't be a panacea or prevent all disease. Of course, people are still going to have sex, and they're still going to have babies without the benefit of this technology. It highlights the importance of people understanding their own genetics and their genetic history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, as I said before, that mitochondrial donation is not human cloning, gene editing or the creation of a three-parent child. It is an assisted reproductive technology that could be used in addition to IVF treatments, enabling a woman whose mitochondria would predispose her to children with mitochondrial disease to have a biological child who does not inherit that trait by using donated mitochondrial material from a donated egg or embryo. It involves the extraction of nuclear genetic material from the prospective mother's egg and the placement of that material into a donor egg which has its own genetic material removed, keeping its own mitochondria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this technology isn't going to help people who are suffering through this terrible disease right now, or those who will unknowingly pass this trait on, but the evidence from overseas does show that mitochondrial donation could stop the inheritance of mitochondrial disease and give people a long and healthy life. So what good reason can there be for not preventing such a painful death in a young child? That is the reality for children born with mitochondrial disease: most will die in their first five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on the inquiry which investigated the science of mitochondrial donation back in 2018, and I thank the Mito Foundation group for pushing for the law reform that is before us today. The parliament and the government have been cautious. At the time, we found that further research and community consultation needed to be done and, over the past couple of years, it has been done. The National Health and Medical Research Council along with the Department of Health have done just that. They've undertaken a series of community consultations looking into community attitudes to ethical, legal and social issues associated with introducing mitochondrial donation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look to the motivation of many people in the chamber here, yes, they have their own concerns about the creation of excess embryos and the destruction of those embryos, and that is a valid ethical concern for them and many other Australians. However, IVF and reproductive technology is widely used in Australia, and that technology comes with all of those ethical questions around excess embryos, the scientific research and all of those different ethical questions. We all know children who have been created through reproductive technology. I'm a very privileged mother to have had the opportunity to have a child through IVF, so it's no surprise to me that there's significant community support for this legislation and the technology but also, as outlined, concern over the rollout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have recommended a regulated approach with ongoing safeguards and ongoing monitoring, which is the case in the legislation before us. There are several protections in the legislation, including counselling for parents about the potential risks and alternative options such as gamete donation. Those protections are all there in the kind of counselling that's available to people using this technology. It's also consistent with gamete donation and other counselling provisions which are well known. Privacy for parents and children is a top priority, as is mandatory reporting for any adverse events. Mitochondrial egg donors are not, of course, considered legal parents. These are all well-known frameworks within our existing reproductive technology landscape, and I think it is really important for this chamber to understand that in the context of it being put forward that this is somehow extremely novel and unknown. It is not. It has been part of the landscape of reproductive technology for decades now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has included in it a staged and closely monitored path forward, with the first stage legalising mitochondrial donation for certain research and training purposes, including undertaking a clinical trial. Should this legislation pass, I certainly wish all of the families and donors involved in that all the best. The bill implements a cautious approach consistent with other reproductive technology. In relation to mitochondrial research, as we know, it's based on the approach used in the UK, which has been in place since 2015. As a mother who has used IVF to have my beautiful son, I understand the stress of infertility and the willingness to endure countless IVF cycles to make a family. The debates about donor conception and the need for children to understand their genetic origins are also important. But, frankly, in that regard, this bill has less complexity in it than legislation dealing with other donor conceptions, I think. There are other options that remain in play for people who carry these genetic variations—you can use a donor—but they are at least as complex as those dealt with in the bill before us. Donated genetic material is hard to come by. I think it will be easier for donors who know they are donating their mitochondrial DNA rather than all their DNA, which is the case for someone who requires an egg donor to bypass carrying this trait forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that from November 2021 many patients can claim a Medicare rebate for preimplantation genetic testing. I was offered this after a number of failed IVF cycles, but it seemed to me: what was the point? It was many thousands of dollars per test. It is little wonder that I decided simply to do more cycles of IVF and forgo the test on the embryo. The kinds of tests that are available currently offer no solution when all of your embryos carry this kind of trait. Again, for those worried about excess embryos, the alternative is years of failed IVF cycles—yes, more embryos and more expense under the current fertility options for these families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">IVF raises myriad ethical questions. One not particularly related to this bill—but many of our debates overlook some of the most fundamental issues in reproductive technology—is the social and economic conditions that mean people delay having a child to start with and then have to resort to using reproductive technology. I would hope that those of you in the chamber who are opposed to IVF might work with others who support it to address some of these underlying issues on which we agree. I certainly hope that mitochondrial donation research will mean fewer IVF cycles and, in the future, healthy babies for many more Australian couples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been extensively consulted on and thought through. It has a system in place that will ensure its ethical application. I consider myself extremely lucky to have a healthy child, and in supporting this bill I do so because I want to support other parents to have the same opportunity—an opportunity to have a healthy child of their own. I'm proud to support the legislation before us today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:47</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging the extensive discussion of the science and the technology that has already been had. I want to acknowledge the incredible contributions of so many of my colleagues in the chamber. It has been an education. I've enjoyed listening to people and will continue to follow the debate for the rest of tonight and tomorrow, because this is a very, very complex piece of legislation and a human issue. Any parent's first response on hearing that they are having a baby or on hearing of a pregnancy is, 'I hope the child will be healthy.' Sadly, not all children are born healthy, but modern medicine has assisted to change the fate of many children. With medical advancement comes not only a desire to do good but a responsibility to do what is right. So our ethics are: to do no harm, don't intervene—health at what cost?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strangely, we often see more outrage expressed about animal testing of products than about the value of human life and the welfare of human beings. Each day, human children, Australian children, are abused in squalor. There is elder abuse and domestic violence, but mention animal testing and people lose their minds. So what value do we put on human life? When is an embryo a life? For women who've experienced joy at seeing a tiny heart beating on a pregnancy scan, life begins at conception. On the other hand, extreme right-to-choose activists openly celebrate abortion at any stage of pregnancy. For me, this is a dilemma. I support technology that allows parents to have healthy children, but this legislation deals with genetic modifications and donations of mitochondrial DNA. I'm a mother who wants everyone to experience having their own children but also feels that people at risk of passing on disabling conditions via their genes should have access to technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just had a great contribution from Senator Pratt about access to other methods of having children—whether that be IVF, adoption or surrogacy—instead of going down a technological road. But, of course, the problem is that the child does not feel biologically the parents' own. My own experience is that I understand only too well the all-consuming desire to have your own child. For me, it was a very, very long six years before I was able to have a baby. But this desire to hold your own child is more complex in this situation, because the mother knows the risk of having her own child. She knows the pain and the suffering that she may have endured and certainly understands what is possible for that child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critics fear that legislating the use of mitochondrial technology will open the door to laws allowing the choosing of babies' gender, hair colour or height. But Maeve's Law, this legislation, is intentionally narrow to avoid that. Mitochondrial donation techniques don't alter personal characteristics and traits, because personal characteristics and traits such as eye colour are derived from the nuclear material. Others are worried that living embryos will be discarded once genetic material is obtained, but our legislation dictates that the procedure happens before an embryo is created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have followed the discussion of the amendments that are being proposed by Senator Canavan and Senator O'Neill, and possibly others, and I look forward to seeing those come forward, because I hope that they may assist me with some of the concerns that I have come upon in researching this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the friends and the families of Maeve, their advocacy and how personal this issue is to them—how close this is to their hearts, in a way that many of us will never understand. But we live in a world where science and technology mean that we have to make decisions that previous parliaments could not have imagined. The ethical considerations around artificial intelligence, as simple as driverless cars, and the science of human DNA selection and amendment are incredibly, incredibly serious and important to the future of our race, our species and our society going forward. This is technology that is being considered in animals, but I keep reflecting: just because we can, does it mean we should?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will spend the rest of this debate period re-reading the correspondence that I've received from a wide range of stakeholders and following the discussions and contributions of my colleagues. The ability to use technology, hopefully, to remove suffering from this particular disease and perhaps others in the future is incredibly tempting, but I don't feel confident that we truly understand the door that we'd be opening by passing this legislation. For that reason, I look forward to any amendments that are being proposed to this legislation, because it truly is, I believe, a fork in the road of our society, the use of technology and how we think about human life.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:54</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the passage of the Mitochondrial Donation Law Reform (Maeve's Law) Bill 2021. This bill marks one of those moments where this place can have a clear and significant impact on the personal lives of some Australian families. It's a reform that has been years in the making and it's a reform that can bring hope and relief to many. Maeve's Law is named in honour of little Maeve Hood, who at 18 months was diagnosed with Leigh syndrome, a severe mitochondrial disorder. The bill was named after Maeve because of the tireless work of her parents, Sarah and Joel, along with the Mito Foundation, who worked to raise awareness and build support for those in our community with mitochondrial disease. It is a testament to their efforts and tireless campaigning that this bill has made it to the Senate floor, and I really hope we will pass this bill as the other place did in the last sitting of 2021. I thank the Hood family, Sean Murray of the Mito Foundation, who has worked so hard explaining to MPs and senators why this bill is so important, and the many other families who have championed this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mitochondrial disease affects all communities in Australia. Just last November over 1,000 Canberrans participated in the 35-kilometre 'Bloody Long Walk' for the Mito Foundation. They walked for the many families who have felt the pain of losing loved ones to this dreadful disease. In preparing for this bill I spent time reading the stories of those Australians who have shared their lives and their stories in advocating for these laws. They are the stories of sons and daughters, mums and dads. And there's little Maeve, who is only five and who has done so much along with her parents to raise awareness of mitochondrial disorders. But there are so many more, and more than 30 stories appear on the mitochondrial website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read every single one of those stories in educating myself to get a full appreciation of why it is so important to pass this bill. Behind those names are the stories of babies, toddlers, young children, teenagers, young adults, middle-aged Australians and older Australians, all affected by mitochondrial disease. The stories are often difficult to read, and the generosity in sharing them, in the single hope that we will change the laws and help families, is the most unselfish of acts. The stories from mums and dads about losing their babies to this disease, written with such love and loss, were painful to read and almost impossible for me to comprehend. The photos that accompanied each story were of cheerful cherubic faces, children with wide smiles surrounded by families, and adults and parents—everyday Australians struck down out of the blue, at random and often with debilitating and life-limiting symptoms. The stories told were of not knowing what was happening to young babies as they started to show symptoms, of the misdiagnoses, of the testing, of the guilt and pain from learning that the condition is passed on from parent to child, and that you as the carrier of the faulty gene had caused this disease to occur in your babies, and of the uncertainty and fear that comes with caring for someone with mitochondrial disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alastair was a Canberran who was diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy in his late 60s. He suffered from poor hearing, loss of balance and extreme fatigue. Unfortunately, Alastair deteriorated quickly. He needed his wife, and eventually his son, to care for him before he passed away aged 74. Alastair told his son, 'Be careful having kids'—what a burden that must be to carry. These people and many others who have been touched by mitochondrial disease are the most powerful of advocates for the change that this law proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an opportunity to take advantage of the advances in reproductive technology to avoid the heartache, pain and anguish of having a child with severe mitochondrial disease. It would amend existing legislation to make mitochondrial donation legal for research, training and human reproductive purposes, allowing families to have a biological child in a way that minimises the risk of transmitting mitochondrial disease. Other senators have gone through the detail of this bill in their contributions, so I won't repeat that other than to say that we know around 56 children are born with the disease each year—approximately one child a week. This bill can reduce that number, and on those grounds alone I support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the bill does raise concerns for some senators. On votes of conscience, when the colours of party are stripped away, we stand here as individuals. We all bring our own perspective and our own life experience to this chamber. I come to this vote as someone who spent years working in the disability sector. I come to this vote as someone who spent eight years as a minister for health. I come to this vote as someone who has experienced the death of loved ones and the deep grief that follows. But, mostly, I come to this vote as a mum of three amazing children.</span>
