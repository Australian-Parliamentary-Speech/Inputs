I do not resile from that at all, and neither does the government. We do support accreditation. We have said that consistently. As we outlined in our policy in the lead-up to the last election, we said that we would be reviewing the accreditation system. We will take into account all of the material available for us in undertaking that process and ensure that there is a very strong accreditation system for the child-care sector in this country.

         The honourable member for Aston asked a serious question because he is seriously concerned about developments in Zaire. I know that all Australians are concerned about developments in Zaire.

         The three&amp;hyphen;week cease-fire, which was declared unilaterally by the alliance of Tutsi rebels, is an encouraging development to the extent that it may, at least temporarily, put an end to the fighting and may provide international relief agencies with a window of opportunity for access to the hundreds of thousands of refugees stranded in Zaire. One offer of a cease-fire is not a permanent solution, but we welcome any steps that will at least enable aid agencies to take the necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the refugees caught in the fighting. We hope that Zaire will cooperate in implementing the cease-fire.

        He asked whether I am in a position to review the matter. I have to say I represent the Minister for Social Security in this place, but I do not make the decisions for her. The government does constantly monitor the appropriateness of the extended deeming rates. It assesses them against market rates that a person could reasonably expect to earn in safe investments. A fall or rise in official interest rates would not be the only factor that would be taken into account in deciding whether to change deeming rates.

        We look at such matters as sustainability. We do not want to cause disruption to pensioners by too frequent changes in the deeming rates themselves. We do look at other factors that influence investments including bank deposits, shares and managed investments. All those matters are taken into account. Obviously, if and when any changes occur, the government would look at it again.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of reports. It is staggering that in two states alone—New South Wales and Queensland—there are 365 unfilled hospital positions. Many of these are very good positions paying up to $75,000 a year, so I was rather surprised to see them represented as dead&amp;hyphen;end jobs by young doctors. I think young doctors need a bit of a reality check, given that most honourable members in this place would represent electorates with average incomes of about $30,000 a year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What it puts lie to is the claim that there are going to be hundreds of young doctors who have no prospect of practising medicine. In fact, I have checked the number of specialty training positions and general practice training positions as best I can. There are 400 training positions next year in general practice; 125 in anaesthetics; 21 in intensive care; 25 in obstetrics and gynaecology; 93 in psychiatry; 22 in ophthalmology; six in dermatology; 35 in radiology; 260 physicians; 54, general surgery; 10, cardio&amp;hyphen;thoracic surgery; 11, neurosurgery; four, paediatrics; six, plastic and reconstructive; 20, urology; 29, orthopaedics; and nine, laryngology. That makes 1,102 training positions. That does not count emergency medicine, occupational medicine, paediatrics, rehabilitation medicine, medical administration, radiotherapy or pathology.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="6497" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         When you add all those together and the other places that become available in speciali ty areas and general practice, the simple fact is that there are more jobs than there are doctors in training positions. The only reason a young doctor needs miss out on a training position is that he or she cannot be bothered to be fully trained.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that for too long general practice has been a dumping ground for the medical profession. Bob Douglas of the ANU showed last year that a third of general practitioners would leave the profession tomorrow if there was something else they could do. Peter Baume, in a report last year, showed that general practice had been progressively deskilled over 20 years. It is time that general practice was given the status, the training and the backup that it deserves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the end, this is incredibly in the public interest. General practice is the basic primary health care in Australia, and to have it detached, deskilled and disillusioned is a tragedy for Australia. I understand the changes put some obligations on young doctors. I understand that it is a change from what they expected. But, without this measure and without the limiting of overseas trained doctors, the fact is that general practice would have no future whatsoever.

We would see some value in third party mediation or good offices in the conflict, provided that such mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations.

         —This question has come up and been canvassed in this place before. The member, very interestingly, has an MPI listed for today, during which we will explore these matters at greater length. In essence, this is a process put in train by the previous government. Advice was tendered to the previous government in May 1995 that the science had been completed after many years of consideration for one aspect of a very wide range of import requirements relating to chicken meat. I can see the previous Minister for Trade watching. He knows the background and, unlike some of his colleagues, understands it.

        The recommendation was noted by the then minister and it was then to proceed.

Their considerations will be taken on board and worked through by the government.

The principle that I established was that we wanted to know whether independent scientific reviews ticked off on the science. We found that, in the case of this one, exhaustively that had been done. On that basis, I find it very hard to find any intellectual reason for reversing the process that you in government set in place. Having said that, I make it quite plain that the commitment we gave that the findings of the Nairn review would be taken into full account for quarantine access requirements stands.

What would be the situation if we said to the young people of tomorrow that this was a government which after five years, although it had told the Australian people that it had balanced the accounts, was running a deficit of $10,000 million? They were out by $10,000 million! Right throughout the election campaign the people of Australia were being told that the accounts were balanced. They were wrong by $10,000 million.

         —I do not know whether it is because it is the Melbourne Cup today, but I am feeling a little hoarse, as members can tell. I thank the member for La Trobe very much for his question. He is of course right: unless the literacy issue can be properly addressed in the early years of schooling, it is very difficult to correct the literacy difficulties of students later on. That is why the government has introduced a new literacy goal that every child should be able to read, write, spell and communicate by the end of primary school. It is also why we have introduced, and will be introducing with the states and territories, national standards for years 3 and 5 in primary school which will meet the needs of students in those early years.

        Members of the House would be particularly interested to know that over the next four years the government will be putting some $635 million into literacy programs. That will include specific targeted programs aimed at these early years of schooling. The expert evidence certainly does confirm what the member for La Trobe has said. He is quite right on that point according to all the information that the government has. We will be

        It is evident that there has not been a single question on this matter from the shadow minister for education. He has completely failed to leave the starting gate. You cannot get him out of the starting gate. I thought today they might get him up on this issue, but they could not even manage it then, when I was feeling a little hoarse. So we have had to have this question asked from our own side.

I also take note of the fact that this is a model example of what can be achieved by a well managed local organisation. They have developed the business over a number of years. Having developed the business and proven that they can service it, they now propose to extend it. The Commonwealth government in return will do everything that it can to assist Rockhampton Airport owners and operators to ensure they can fulfil the extension of their runway and

         —People working in agricultural industries in Australia dependent on very strong quarantine protocols have reason to be concerned about the early performance of the Howard government and the performance of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in its first few months. It is not just about imported cooked chicken meat. It is a very real question of quarantine issues across a range of products, and producers are now starting to come forward. I include salmon producers from Tasmania, who are becoming concerned, apple producers, and pear producers, who are threatened by the risk of fire blight disease from New Zealand.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister's performance at question time today only serves to heighten those concerns. The minister's answers were, I think, very slippery indeed. It has been my experience that when ministers resort to answers that are slippery it is because their actions are suspect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What are our suspicions? The first thing that has happened is that the minister has very clearly reneged on an unequivocal coalition undertaking and promise in this area. He wrote in February of this year, when he was the shadow minister, to the President of the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group. This is a letter I sought leave to table during question time today and leave was denied. What did you have to hide? Now I have to read it in here. It is a letter in which the minister, when he was the shadow minister, very clearly said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A Coalition Government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols, including the one for salmonid products, until such time as the scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted upon in full.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was a very clear undertaking and it is now being breached. He has been caught out not only by us but also by his coalition partners. I am sure he was very uncomfortable as he watched the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report
        </emphasis>
        last Wednesday night on the ABC when it was covered, in particular when Ray Moynihan raised the question. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . at a private Liberal Party meeting in early October, the Prime Minister indicated that any decision on chicken meat would come to Cabinet. The PM's comments highlight just how sensitive

         an issue this is for a government dependent on a large rural constituency. And they could signify a major change in quarantine policy, moving decision&amp;hyphen;making from AQIS firmly into the political arena.

       </para>

        He further went on to say:

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It goes further than this. In question time today, he tried to pass it off on us. He made the claim, as he was reported to have done by AAP on Friday last week, that he was moving in this direction because the previous Labor minister had already taken the decision. Today, he tried again to create the impression that former Minister Collins had already taken the decision. But, of course, we know what happened: the minister saw the report and noted it. Anyone, particularly in this place, who has been in these positions knows very well that there is one hell of a difference between noting a report and taking a decision to implement its recommendations. To stand up there and portray that the minister had already taken the decision—and that is why you are breaching your undertakings—is trying to slide around a broken promise. That is what we are talking about here.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To do what you did to me today—to misrepresent my position, to bring in a personal note I wrote to you, which I dealt with a little earlier—simply underlines the fact that you are getting desperate. Your coalition partners are concerned about your handling of this matter and you are resorting to tactics. While the Prime Minister claims to be looking for high standards from his ministers, he will probably have a word to you about this at another point.

         7.30 Report

        We are seeing, Minister, in a number of these issues that even the science is not clear and defined.

The way they set up the legislation—with our support; it has not been changed—is that AQIS does the technical risk assessment work and the director makes a decision. That then goes to the minister. All the minister does is note it. He did not annotate it. He noted it. He signed it.

I intend to answer the political points. I begin by saying that it is typical of the utter gall of this mob to try to imply that we are lowering Australia's quarantine standards. It was us who pushed you so hard to conduct a full independent scientific inquiry into AQIS. Your then minister held out for as long as he possibly could. He finally did it. But it was as a result of the pressure that we brought to bear, along with industry, that you finally put together Professor Malcolm Nairn's inquiry.

It is all about net benefit to the rural communities. That is what it is about. That is why you had our support for this broad approach. That is why the farm groups broadly supported it.

Here they are looking on and wondering why in the name of good fortune—when your minister notes that this is ready to progress—nothing happens for nine months.

I want to again emphasise the way in which the procedure worked. I wish to put on the record again that what I did not know and what I could not have known in opposition was that after seven years of analysis, scientific study and discussion the former minister had a final report from AQIS in May 1995 indicating its technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the USA and Denmark subject to the fulfilment, as specified in strict conditions, which we are progressing right at this moment. Access to Thailand would also be granted subject to the outcome of processing plant inspections. The former minister, I repeat, noted this. He signed off on it.

        AQIS intended to take the formal decision on entry after the former minister concluded further consultations with industry, but he did not do so. On the industry's own admission, nine months went by and nothing happened. Procrastination and mismanagement by the former minister left the director of quarantine open to legal challenge and Australia susceptible to international trade challenge. Faced with this situation, I did the only sensible thing I could: I opened up consultations with the industry and I set in place the two groups that I have just mentioned.

         Like the coalition senators who sit on the committee, I call upon the minister to immediately embrace the recommendations of the committee and to act upon them. The Senate committee has recognised that the proposal to allow for the importation of cooked chicken meat poses a real threat to the industry and to Australia's native bird population. Unlike the minister, the committee has been reluctant to accept AQIS's recommendations and its guarantees that the importation of cooked chicken meat can proceed without the risk of the introduction to this country of the dreaded newcastle disease and the infectious bursal disease. Unlike the minister, the committee has listened to the industry and was left holding grave doubts about the science underpinning AQIS's recommendations.

The committee has recommended that the government should do what the minister was unprepared to do, and that is to look seriously at a GATT friendly assistance package if, in the longer term, we are unable to gather enough scientific evidence to deny the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. It is a question of science, not a question of trade policy. But the minister's embarrassment does not end there either. The committee, chaired by their own Senator Winston Crane, has recommended that the Quarantine Act 1908 be amended to put the final decision not in the hands of the minister necessarily but, to use their own words, back into the hands of the minister `and/or the government'.

They have no confidence in the minister's ability to competently handle this application or, for that matter, any future applications, whether they be with respect to salmon, apples or pears.

The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has already referred to the letter—which he sought to table—from the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), where he clearly states that the former minister only noted the AQIS recommendations. I do recognise one thing. I do recognise that the parliamentary secretary did get it wrong when he said that it is not yet legislated. That in itself expresses his total ignorance of how the act works.

It is in this area that we find the greatest differences between the former minister's approach and the current minister's approach to the applications from Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into Australia. As I said, AQIS does not require the minister's approval, but it does have to seek his imprimatur.

The member for Burke has referred to Minister Anderson's letter. It is dated 14 February 1996, nicely just prior to the election. I will just quote the last paragraph where he says:

But he proved too cautious and too determined to protect the interests of the industry from disease.

Because it is such an important matter, it was raised in the Liberal Party room where there was not a whisper of no confidence in the minister. The comment was, `Since this is so important, we ought to strengthen the minister's arm by getting frontbench approval.' That's why it has gone to cabinet—because we think this is important enough to warrant cabinet intervention.

        Unlike those opposite, I happen to have a particular interest in AQIS and a particular interest in the clean and green image of Australian exports. I will not stand silent when this sort of nonsense is being run in this chamber this afternoon by the member for Burke and the member for Hunter. Why do I have a particular interest? Because, as Mr Crean knows, I am in an area which happens to be uniquely fruit fly free in Australian terms and, for that reason, I have grown up in a quarantined area, an area in which the standard of AQIS and the standard of quarantine was absolutely important. I will tolerate nothing that compromises Australia's quarantine standards, neither will the minister and neither will any member of the government.

         Here we are dealing with the fundamental question of imported cooked chicken meat. The nonsense you are running suggests that in some way the minister is compromised when he has done precisely the opposite. But does it concern anyone opposite that all of this argument, including the member for Burke's MPI, may in some way itself compro mise Australia's image overseas? No. If it is popular—and I know that this is popular because I know what my chicken growers are saying—let's run it.

        The grim reality is that we cannot afford to stand up here and be unnecessarily critical of AQIS because it not only implies that what comes into Australia comes in and is not adequately supervised; it also suggests that what goes out—our clean and green image—is in some way compromised as well. It is inexcusable and unforgivable for the member for Burke to hang AQIS out to dry without any adequate evidence. That is what he has chosen to do with this MPI today. Why am I passionate about this? Because we are going through it now with cooked chicken meat and we had to face precisely the same dilemma over salmon and apples. We, the government, do not intend to compromise on any of these issues.

The coalition recognises in government, even more clearly than it did in opposition, the obligations we have under GATT to allow reasonable trading arrangements. We recognise that we are facing difficult and unpopular decisions that we cannot take anything but a responsible stance on, that we cannot take a populist stance on, and that if we fail to deliver on them we will put Australian exporting industries at risk. For that reason we have been consistent.

The minister has been entirely consistent. This MPI deserves to be tossed out of the parliament and certainly does not deserve the debating time that it has been afforded.

Last week the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Trans port Legislation Committee said that it was not satisfied with the science that has previously cleared the importation of cooked chicken meat. There is a growing distrust of our quarantine inspection capabilities, and the answers from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in this House this afternoon did nothing to convince me that the decision to import chicken meat will be anything other than a short&amp;hyphen;sighted level playing field, no trade barrier decision to placate our trading partners, rather than a decision based on sound scientific judgment.

        It is particularly in the area of importing New Zealand apples and the risk of importing fire blight where I see another looming danger for my own electorate. Two reports issued in early August suggest the risk of importing New Zealand apples to Australia exceed any trading benefits. A New Zealand proposal to send apples to Australia is being reviewed by both the AQIS and the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics. ABARE estimated the spread of fire blight into Australia could cause crop losses of between 20 and 30 per cent and believes it is uncertain whether fire blight can be restricted to one region by quarantine and control measures should it arrive. Fire blight also has the potential to devastate all plants in the Roseaceae family, including roses and the thousands of ornamental berry trees that grace the central tablelands where I live and elsewhere in this country.

The committee recommends AQIS commission tests of the thermal inactivation of the newcastle disease virus which, if imported, could not only devastate our industry but make inroads into our native fauna. The committee is reluctant to dismiss lightly concerns from scientists within the Australian chicken meat industry about some of the assumptions AQIS has made.

         I find it hard to reconcile these doubts with the minister's answer to the House this afternoon suggesting, because the previous government had allegedly cleared the scientific studies into imported chicken meat, because the process was put in train by the previous government, that the decision had effectively been made and he would find it hard to reverse the decision. The AQIS view is not infallible. It has been found wanting on other occasions. There is enough doubt over the chicken meat issue to raise serious questions about its ability to reach a sound judgment on the threat from fire blight. The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture, in a letter to AQIS in December last year claims:

         Yet fire blight is a serious bacterial disease in 34 countries. Why should we believe the New Zealanders who also most likely delivered us johnes disease in carpet wool sheep in the 1970s—when our quarantine was fairly impeccable, I might add? I am told submissions to AQIS on the fire blight study have been extended until the end of this month. AQIS will then prepare a draft pest risk analysis to go out to the public for comment before a final decision early in the new year at the best. Given the adherence to the trading imperatives we face, `We don't rock the boat attitudes' and the minister's acceptance of a process set in train, he says, by a former government—so I guess everything is okay—I hold real concerns for the imperatives that will determine AQIS's final recommendation. Our research and quarantine record and reputation is in danger of being sidelined for short&amp;hyphen;term trading imperatives. What is the

All of them were allocated outside of the state of Queensland. I got the commissioner in and asked why there were no Queenslanders and he told me we were under an agreement with the other states to take the lowest tender. Where this is most relevant to this debate is the fact that in seven years Victoria had not allocated a single electricity contract outside the state of Victoria. So while people sign these agreements there are those out there who actively circumvent the agreements on a continuous basis. That is an important background to the decision we are talking about here today. The ALP in this place, the opposition, has come up and acted holier than thou, which is a most remarkable performance.

If ever there is a town which reflects what has gone wrong in this country and the decision making of the now opposition—the Keating&amp;hyphen;Hawke government—it is the town of Mareeba. We had a TB eradication campaign introduced and that wiped out 600,000 head of cattle; it did not wipe out TB but it did succeed in getting rid of our cattle.

The incoming Goss Labor government in Queensland introduced an increase in water charges from around $5 up to around $30 a megalitre and that closed down the rice industry. The deregulation of the tobacco industry is another example. We removed the 50 per cent home content rule from tobacco, which was nothing to do with tobacco being dangerous to health or any of those things.

I asked whether this was done before this time last year and she said, `Yes, all of it was done before this time last year.' I said, `Fine. You came to this parliament and you told us that this is quite a safe decision,' yet I am holding here the quotes from the hearings of the Senate. Senator O'Chee said:

        Are you aware of a letter that Mr Alexander wrote to Mr Peter Board on 9 February 1993, in response to Mr Board's earlier correspondence advising that AQIS was reviewing Australia's prohibition of importation of chicken meat and chicken meat products on the basis of the use of at least one of five time temperature treatments? I ask whether you are aware that, in his response, Mr Alexander said—

        I am not going to read all five pages here, but it probably does behove me to read one other quotation from Senator O'Chee. He said:

         But you are aware of the fact that if you have different concentrations of the organism then you will require longer time temperature cooking to reach a level at which you can say there is a low probability of effective survival . . . but you do not actually have, across the whole range of meat product, a particular time temperature limit at which you can guarantee no effective survival.

         AQIS came forward to the meeting that I attended and told us all that it was 100 per cent safe, yet they are holding a letter from their own expert saying that there are three areas that need to be tested—one is the heat, one is the time that you apply the heat for and one is the pathogen level and the type of pathogen strain that you are dealing with. The third parameter has not been tested.

       <para>
        This amendment, the piece of work that we seek to include in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, is very short. The purpose of it is to allow persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which has been recently discussed in this House, to be appointed as authorised officers under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 with all the powers of an authorised officer other than specified enforcement powers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendment is sought by the government as a result of concerns raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding the unlimited nature of the enforcement powers which would flow to persons authorised under the Imported Food Control Act 1992. As a result of the amendment, AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to industry as it not only minimises the duplication of inspection service activities but also provides a more flexible approach to inspection service delivery in locations where an AQIS officer is not readily available.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The importing industry has been consulted at length and strongly supports the amendment. In essence, it is about delivering to the importing community a more flexible inspection system of the sort that we are very vigorously engaged in supplying to the exporting community. In the vast majority of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         circumstances, inspections are, and will continue to be, carried out in the major port facilities as this is where the bulk of imported food products enter the country. But there are occasions when inspections need to be carried out in more remote locations and the services of an AQIS officer are not available.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        People have been concerned that this may amount to import facilitation, but it is not really quite so much that as facilitating those who use imported product. For example, the dairy industry and other food processing companies often import some product or some part of the materials that they use in their food processing on a seasonal&amp;hyphen;basis need and are able to inspect it at the local level and in the regions. They often cannot find an AQIS officer readily available and, when they bring one in, they find that it is very expensive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under those circumstances, it seems more than appropriate—indeed, very sensible—to ensure that people such as local health inspectors or other suitably qualified people can provide basic service delivery in this regard. Therefore, we do endorse the approach.

But what we see now is the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, the government will not provide capital funding to build the promised 5,500 new long day care places, it is restricting eligibility for child&amp;hyphen;care assistance and it is applying a means test to the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate.

I submit that because it was at Cranbourne that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the coalition's child&amp;hyphen;care policy—perhaps best described as its ill-fated child&amp;hyphen;care policy—during the election campaign in March. We can all well recall pictures flashed across the newspapers of the country of the Prime Minister seated at a child's tea set enjoying a tea party with a young child&amp;hyphen;care beneficiary.

        As the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has so lucidly pointed out, the Labor Party takes great pride in the fact that as a government we had established a system of high quality, affordable child care that was the envy of the rest of the world. In fact, the introduction of such a service was largely driven by the recognition of the fact that there was an increasingly large number of women in our society who wished, as I will allude to a little later on, to pursue working careers, and without adequate child care many women would be denied this fundamental right, this basic opportunity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, as the member for Wills has succinctly drawn to the attention of the House, child care and the use of that facility in Australia has grown to such an extent that there are currently over half a million children in Australia enjoying the benefits of Commonwealth funded child care. The government justifies these changes to the child&amp;hyphen;care system, such as this bill's abolition of the operational subsidy for community based long day care, by claiming that this initiative shall encourage services to be more efficient and more cost competitive with the private sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is the thinking that is identified by the fundamental flaw of, as we see in so many other pieces of legislation before this House, the government again failing to recognise the value of child care. In this instance, the government recognises the price of everything but the value of nothing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's thinking is that the private sector can and ought to provide child&amp;hyphen;care services: let us save a few bucks and leave it to the private sector. Those of us on this side of the House have no objection to the role of the private sector in child care. In fact, it was under the last Labor government that the operation of private child&amp;hyphen;care providers absolutely flourished.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We on this side also accept the notion that there is a direct role for government to play.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Long day care is an excellent example of where this should occur. For instance, compared with the private sector, government subsidised community based long day care provides services for children with special needs, more places for babies and extended hours that are, in many instances, beyond the range of the hours provided by private sector based child&amp;hyphen;care operators.

        I return to the month or so prior to March of this year to remind those present in the House of the Prime Minister's often touted election slogan: for all of us. We on this side have come to realise that `for all of us', when defined in practice, falls a long way short of the people who need to be brought up to the standards enjoyed by many Australians, those people Labor never left behind and whom this government is seeking again to leave behind. Of course, I am talking about the children of this nation who will be denied access now to proper child care.

        This bill makes clear the government's priority when it does turn to families; that is, those in which one partner is at home caring for children. It is not those families in which both parents are working. The government, in this legislation, is clearly saying to the over 50 per cent of women who are working these days, `Don't work or we'll penalise you. We'll take away your right. We'll take away the opportunity Labor afforded you to gain access to community day care for your children.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        The abolition of this operational child&amp;hyphen;care subsidy is yet another broken promise from a government that promised to set a new standard in propriety. It has demonstrated, through its failure to keep its word or act with some integrity, on too many occasions of late a new low standard that will draw forth the scorn of all Australian people.

        The Chief Executive of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Mr Robert Barnes, has claimed that `the loss of operational subsidies will mean rises in council&amp;hyphen;run child care taking funds from elsewhere or closing centres'. Having taken away this $118 million from community based day care, it is not likely that councils—councils such as the City of Kingston within my own electorate of Isaacs, which will lose $120,000 in funding for its four child&amp;hyphen;care centres—will be able to come up with replacement funding. There is no way the costs to parents will not rise unless—I suspect that Kingston may well do this—the quality of child&amp;hyphen;care services provided is reduced.

        The thrust of this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill is to discontinue payments of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. The impact of the bill is shown in the financial impact statement contained in the bill's explanatory memorandum. The bill says it will achieve net savings of $118.4 million over the first four years. Because they are net amounts, which otherwise would have been contributed by the government, they have to be made up out of the pockets of parents. Because they come out of the pockets of parents, they are a gross figure. So, effectively, that is $220 million coming from the parents of children in community based long day care centres if they want to, or are able to, maintain current standards.

        There is no doubt on any objective analysis that it has been the community based day care centres which have been the innovators and the developers of the first&amp;hyphen;class facilities.

        The benefits of the community based centres are that they enable minority groups, which include, quite frequently, children with special needs, to have access to the centres. Not only are those children with special needs children from poor families, they also include children who lack English skills and indeed, quite frequently, children with disabilities. The operational subsidies have meant, quite literally, that those first&amp;hyphen;class services have been affordable and accessible to the total spectrum of those in our community requiring community based day care facilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite simply poor government to abdicate the field of quality child care to private interests, as this government is well down the track of doing. As one commentator said, `We don't dump kids in a school system that we don't regulate and don't fund,' and it is absolutely no different in terms of the crucial preschool age.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is already a black economy in child care which follows on from the United States example where so many child-care centres, if you can call them that, are regarded as `child warehouses', where parents literally dump the kids off at the door of these child warehouses just as someone might dump a pet off at a local kennel before they go on holidays. They do not particularly want to look inside because they do not want to be distressed when they are away.

         For instance, in the St George region just outside my electorate, we have a centre for children with learning disabilities. The convener at that centre, Ms Maria Cook, has written to the Prime Minister. She said in her letter to the Prime Minister that, if you do not provide adequate care and if you do not properly train teachers at this level, it will result in kids with disabilities being undetected and you are not going to be able to apply the right treatment and help where it is required.

The government's claim that it is interested in addressing illiteracy will come to naught if it does not and is not addressing the problem at the very earliest opportunity—that is, in these vital preschool years.

The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is nothing but philosophically driven claptrap. To suggest that people in this day and age, particularly women, should be denied access to affordable child care is akin to suggesting to people they have no legitimate right to take a role in the work force if they are women, that they have no legitimate right to seek some opportunities for respite care for their kids or that this might be some sort of a rort to the system.

        In respect of child care, they are suggesting that, because they believe saving $118.4 million over three years is an appropriate way to attack child care, they are going to put in place this legislation. This legislation will, firstly, discontinue the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres to take effect from 1 July next year and, secondly, amend the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to reduce the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut&amp;hyphen;off for part A of the family tax initiative, which is currently $70,000 per annum for a family with one child.

        Community based long day care centres are non-profit centres. Centres in my electorate are normally administered by a committee made up of parents and other members of the community. This is of great benefit for all those involved—the children, the parents, the community and the centre. The big plus is, I believe, the ability of a centre run this way to be more responsive to the needs of those involved. The provision of the opportunity for parents to be so involved in decisions affecting the care of their children is of great comfort. Let us face it: most parents would prefer their children to be cared for in the home. It is a sad indictment of our society that these days, if a family wants to get ahead, it is often necessary for both mother and father to go out to work.

        Operational subsidies are targeted for removal from 1 July 1997 for community based long day care centres. This subsidy is paid by the government to these centres which are owned and operated by the community on a non-profit basis. Many of these centres in my electorate of Oxley have operated for more than 20 years. Subsidies have given these community based organisations the financial help they have needed to continue to provide a service for the thousands of children who attend them. The continued viability of these centres is questionable if the removal of the operational subsidy goes ahead. Without the subsidy, some families will have to find at least another $15 to $20 a week for child care. To many Australian families who are already battling to find the money to pay the bills, this will be the last straw.

         Operational subsidies cost the government $137 million in the 1995-96 budget. This was paid to the community based long day care centres and family day care centres. Under the present proposal, long day care centres will lose their subsidy as of 1 July 1997. Unfortu nately, this loss will mean that the price of care will have to increase by the amount of the subsidy withdrawn. This could ultimately bring about the closure of some centres.

        This operational subsidy was introduced to encourage the provision of quality child care in those areas shunned by the private child-care sector. Why? Because these operators prefer to set up centres only in economically viable areas. Operational subsidies received by the long day care community centres help to offset the expense of operating in rural and remote areas. Operational subsidies mean that long day care centres can offer a high standard of quality care to children who because of their age—many of them are under two years—need special care and attention. This care and attention is simply not provided by the private sector.

The saving from this would enable the government to retain operational subsidy to long day care centres. This would benefit the community, employment and those parents who are trying to keep their heads above water. It would also mean that in some cases working mums would not be forced into a situation where they will have to give up their jobs and get back on to the social security roundabout.

        Child&amp;hyphen;care assistance and the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate will be paid by a new Commonwealth service delivery agency from 1 January 1998.

This, I believe, will leave the door wide open for the system to be abused and some parents using the money for purposes other than intended.

It is well documented that the preschool formative years have a significant and long&amp;hyphen;lasting effect on the school performance of the child. It cannot be disputed that the greater the enriching experiences a preschool child has and the greater the level of security and safety, the more chance that child has in fulfilling their opportunities in life.

        Children spend their formative years in many places not under the direct influence of government regulation, not least in their own home. But, where they spend time in organisations that are directly under the province of government, we have a responsibility to provide a high quality service. This also provides an important opportunity to raise the level of awareness amongst the broader community about high quality child care and raises the acceptable standards of the entire community.

        To me this is one of the most important imperatives for continuing the operational funding to community based centres. In many areas these organisations are the flagships of quality by which parents can have a benchmark to judge the service they receive. Many parents are also in areas where private providers are few and far between because the economic base or the geographic spread of the population makes private centres less financially viable. It is a great shame that the current government, as part of its first budget, has also cut thousands of places that were planned for new growth.

        The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 abolishes the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres.

        Choice in child care for parents should not revolve simply around the purchasing power of the dollar. It is not good enough to say that if you want to spend more you can buy better quality when it comes to the critical years our children spend in preschool facilities. Real choice relies on an educated population who understand the balance of quality and price issues effectively enough to allow them to make informed choices with their money. Community based and government subsidised child&amp;hyphen;care services have provided the measuring stick for many parents in this field. At the end of the day they may choose not to use a community based centre but, as part of the real choice, they should have that option to consider. What happens in reality is that those centres hold excellent reputations in their local communities and are so in demand that many parents who would use them by choice are not able to get places in them.

        It is an obvious statement to say that an under two&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old child requires far more supervision than older children. This means a far higher staff to child ratio and therefore significantly increases the costs to the provider. It is no coincidence that this is an area with a huge unmet demand problem already. In my own electorate of Throsby, only 25 per cent of the current private centres provide any positions for under two&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds. Children with disabilities and children at risk particularly need the option of a quality fully resourced centre to provide for their needs. The families of these children are often already faced with significant out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses to meet the child's needs and should not have to face personally providing extra

The interaction provided is important for the growth of that child and ensures that other children are able to develop the compassion and understanding that we all should have for children in this situation. If this type of cost cutting forces those parents to take their children back into the home, then we have moved a long way backwards in our recognition of the dignity and rights of children.

        Finally, I would like to comment on the other proposals which change the eligibility and administration of the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate. This scheme was put into place by the Labor government in July 1994. It was the first formal recognition that child care constitutes an essential expense incurred in earning an income. It provided some assistance to working families not benefiting from targeted child&amp;hyphen;care assistance and some further assistance to those in receipt of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance. Most significantly, the rebate was not income tested because it was already a direct recognition of the cost of child care as a legitimate work related expense. It was administered as a direct rebate rather than as a tax concession because this allocation is to be paid to families not in direct income&amp;hyphen;earning situations, such as those studying, training or, indeed, seeking work.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Means testing the child&amp;hyphen;care rebate is therefore a direct contradiction of the purpose of the rebate in the first place, and it is a clear broken promise by the current government. Over the last decade, we have developed a child&amp;hyphen;care system in Australia that is of world standard. Much of this achievement has been based on the funding of a system that has ensured quality and equity. To attack this now is short&amp;hyphen;sighted and self&amp;hyphen;defeating penny&amp;hyphen;pinching which can only negate results for all the interested parties. Not least of all, the children will be directly affected. I totally oppose what the government is proposing.

        In removing the operational subsidy from community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres, the Howard government has taken a further step towards the Americanisation of child care—a system regarded as one of the worst in the world because of its high costs, poor standards, low wages and unequal access. The members of the coalition have no appreciation of the high quality of child care provided by community based long day care centres. These centres provide more places for children with special needs and provide extended opening hours for working parents. They are staffed by a highly dedicated and qualified staff and cater for small babies as well as older children. It is these centres that will be hit by increased costs with the removal of this operational subsidy.

Given that cutting costs further is not an option for the centre, as the centre is already trying to cope with constraints on its funding from local government sources, the  only alternative it will have will be to increase fees to parents.

        The point I wish to make in this debate is that, when you strip the rhetoric of this budget away and examine the financial impact and direction of many of these government proposals, it is clear that the intent of John Howard's family taxation package, combined with these child-care measures, is to simply drive some of the working women out of the work force back into the home. That is despite the fact that there are women who must, of necessity, work to supplement the inadequate wages received by males in the household.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Australian society over the past three decades has changed dramatically, and so has the role of women in that society. The increased participation of women in the work force has been driven in some cases by the increases in educational opportunities for women, which has legitimately raised their own personal expectations of taking fuller advantages of expanded life choices. For many other women, sheer economic necessity has propelled them to enter the work force to put food on the table, to pay off the home mortgage, and to educate their children.

        Some key statistics bear out the degree to which women currently participate in the work force. The ABS family national summary of 1996 showed that, in 1985, 45.5 per cent of couples with dependants were both employed. By 1995 this had grown to 57 per cent. Between 1980 and 1995, the labour force participation rate for females increased by nine per cent, from 44.8 to 53.8 per cent. Of course, there are those in the community who bemoan these developments, who seek to deny women the opportunity to work, and who seek to turn the clock back. I am afraid

The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment has estimated labour turnover costs at between 50 and 130 per cent of the past incumbent's salary. In the car industry in 1990 it was estimated it cost $850 per car for each unwanted staff turnover in a 4,000 person factory. I mention this point because there are many women employed in the car industry in my electorate. In the finance sector it was estimated that losing an employee with eight years experience cost $80,000. I mention these examples because there are many in our community who would deny the efficiency gains and the overall economic benefits to enterprises and the nation of an expanded work force with high levels of female participation.

        In conclusion, let me point out the reality of what these child-care fee increases mean in community based long day care centres. It will mean that many working parents will simply drop out of employment. The important tasks performed by these centres in monitoring children at risk will itself be at risk. The quiet community setting where parents can talk with professionals about their children and get good advice may in the long term be closed off to those parents. For single mothers who do not have family or neighbourhood support, these fee increases will put even one day's care to give these deserving mothers a break from their children out of the reach of many of those single mothers. The simple question will be asked by many women from low income families, `What is the point of me going to work?' and they will simply drop out of the work force.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, when I first entered the work force—I dare say when you first entered it—we all aspired to a permanent job that we might hold for 40&amp;hyphen;odd years. The reality today is that when people enter the work force it may not be for a full&amp;hyphen;time job, it may be for a part-time job. Whether you are female or male, you can anticipate periods where you will be in full&amp;hyphen;time employment, periods where you might be in part-time employment and periods where you might withdraw completely from the work force. Increasingly this is happening to both men and women in our society.

        For families there can be no more important responsibility than the care and upbringing of their children. In looking at this mobility in the work force, this changing work pattern and the need for workers to be completely retrained for different occupations throughout their lifetimes, the availability of child care becomes absolutely important for families. I contend that child care is exceptionally beneficial for the children involved. Like other speakers, I have to confess that in the past my family has been privileged to be able to utilise child care for our four children.

        We keep on being abused by government members about our record of 13 years. But one of the achievements that we can point to is the tremendous increase in the availability of child-care places. Much as I am proud of that—and I am sure most members on this side of the House are proud of that—there are still not sufficient places to meet demand, and then there are issues of equity and access to child care.

        When I go around my electorate and talk to women in this situation, one of the keys for them re&amp;hyphen;entering the work force is, in fact, the availability of child care. One of the things that I find I am rather horrified about is the fact that there can often be just a marginal difference between them remaining at home or entering the work force and paying for child care. Economically, it is almost a case of indifference—that is, there is hardly a benefit in it and, if there is, it is marginal. But, of course, it does wonders for them and for their self&amp;hyphen;esteem and confidence, and they are very keen to take up whatever opportunities there are. Regrettably, under this present government, there are going to be decreasing opportunities in the workplace, not increased opportunities. For a whole variety of reasons, child care is important.

        We get into some ideological debates. If I say that I have a preference for community based child care, perhaps some people will say that I am being an ideologue. That may be the case. I recognise that there are private child-care providers and that they have a role in our society. But I want to mention some figures about child care in the two local government areas in my electorate. Firstly, Blacktown has 20 long day care centres catering for 1,350 children, three out of school hours programs catering for 93 children and a family day care service catering for 600 children. I might say that the family day care service employs some 142 carers. Secondly, Penrith Council has 17 long day care centres, nine out of school hours centres and one occasional day care centre catering for something like 2,000 children. Penrith claims that they are the child&amp;hyphen;care capital of New South Wales. As I have said before, I do not get into that debate. I just say that both councils have demonstrated a real commitment to young families in their respective
        <break page="6537" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         areas because of the number of community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres that they are involved in.

        When we say that the opposition is going to cut out the operational subsidy, it sounds as though it is so many dollars and cents and perhaps it is a very small amount and, after all, aren't we just a whingeing opposition? Let me say that, for Blacktown Council, the amount of the operational subsidy for its centres is $800,000 per annum. For Penrith Council, it is about $740,000 per annum. I know that Blacktown and Penrith are fairly significant councils. Indeed, Penrith—a Liberal controlled council, I might add—was so strapped for cash that it increased the rates by nine per cent this year. I do not have to tell you just what multiples over and above the rate of inflation that represents.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The point that I really want to make—and it is not to score political points—is that they just do not have that money available to pick up the shortfall. They cannot say to the federal government, `Oh well, you have cut the operational subsidy; we'll pick it up.' They just do not have that spare cash available. So what does that mean? It means that the users of the centre are going to have to pay.

        We have heard a lot about battlers. I am proud of the fact that I have a pretty large amount of public housing in my electorate. The private housing is often what I would call first level or first time private home owner. In other words, the families have scraped together every cent and probably borrowed to the hilt to get into the house they call their own and pay off their mortgage. So an unforeseen increase like this is just absolutely devastating. To say that it will have no impact is just a lot of bunkum. In fact, these measures, ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of child care, is one of the most savage attacks on the women of Australia, in particular the women of my electorate and their children, that I have ever seen.

        Last but not least, it has really been through the commitment of the previous Labor government that we have so many child&amp;hyphen;care places in the Penrith and Blacktown city council areas. But where are the additional places going to come from? Are they going to come through serendipity? Are we going to have some magic—and suddenly there will be some child&amp;hyphen;care places created there? It really does require a commitment by the government to ensuring that those people who wish to utilise child care for their children, those women and families who want to get out into the work force or to return to the work force, are able to do so because of the availability of child&amp;hyphen;care places.

        This government is deliberately striking at the choice those parents make. It is deliberately targeting community child&amp;hyphen;care centres.

        That child&amp;hyphen;care centre, because of its target client group, ensures that its fees are at the lowest possible level so it can provide support which the community values. That community knows that without that support many of those young children would grow up in much worse circumstances. With these changes and with the difficulties they have confronted they have approached the department. Indeed, I have written to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is at the table, about their plight.

        When they approached the department the caring shoulder they leant on said, `Find another clientele. Find someone else who can afford to pay higher rates.' In other words, they said, `Turn away those children who come to you from difficult family backgrounds, from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds. Put them back on the streets and go and find someone who can afford to pay a higher bill.' That has been the response from this government. To the best of my knowledge, I have not got a response from the minister at all to the letter which I sent in relation to this matter. Given that the minister is at the table, that is something she might like to take account of.

         —This schedule seeks to eliminate the operational subsidy that is currently paid to community based long day care and the opposition has indicated that it will be opposing this schedule for a number of very important reasons. The first, I would have to say, is that one of the roles an opposition has is to keep a government to its promises. This government made it very clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care.

        The effect of removing the operational subsidy will be that centres will have two choices. Either they will put up their fees by anything between $20 and $25 a week per child or—this is the one the government favours—they will have to reduce their services. One service all the community based centres around Australia are considering

         removing is the more extensive, highly qualified staff that they have in their centres. The effect will be a reduction in the quality of care children in community based centres have in this country.

        Secondly, parents will be required to either pay more for food or provide lunches, fresh fruit, morning tea and afternoon tea for their children in the centres. That will mean that parents will indirectly be paying more for their children's care. Other services that centres are talking about removing are nappy services and other services that in any other place would be considered essential services. To say that somehow this move is going to improve efficiency I can only say is very short&amp;hyphen;sighted and is not a view of efficiency I can understand. This view of efficiency equates poorer quality, more children per staff member, poorly qualified staff and lesser services with efficiency—a very funny definition.

        What is very important for those members opposite to recognise is that all around Australia there are people writing to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me about their very grave concerns of these changes. I have letters from all the states and territories of Australia. In the short time available, I will choose a couple of paragraphs from some of them to show the huge concern that exists in the community about this change. It is a very serious change because it is going to abolish the notion of community based long day care in this country. I would like to quote from a letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which the writer sent to me. She is from Western Australia and she says:

Our community based centre provides this but is now threatened by your budget cut.

Community based centres cater for about 70,000 families.

        Importantly, all special or high cost services provided by community child&amp;hyphen;care centres are also provided by the private child&amp;hyphen;care sector. Accordingly, there is no justification to continue with the differential in government assistance between the two sectors, clearly prejudicing one group of parents. The removal of the untargeted operational subsidy from community child-care centres removes a significant inequity in government assistance that currently exists between families using the different facilities.

         The member for Barton (Mr McClelland) implied that the private sector is not subject to the same standards as the community based sector. Quality is assured in both sectors through the state and territory licensing regulations and the Commonwealth government's quality improvement and accreditation system. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) can reassure constituents that the government is committed to maintaining accreditation and to extending it to outside school hours care and, in particular, to family day care, which is a very flexible option.

         Operational subsidy has been retained in family day care and in occasional care. I heard one of the members opposite saying that we are going to cut all of the subsidies to all child&amp;hyphen;care services. The fact is that we will be spending $5 billion in this term of government on child-care services. We will be retaining operational subsidy for the family day care program, for occasional care, for outside school hours care, for the multifunctional services and the multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families.

Over the next four years $10.9 million will be provided to fund new places in rural and remote areas. After all, these are the parents in our community who have been most affected by the economic conditions brought about by the former government. These are people who have suffered drought, who have suffered economic hardship and who also have not been, under the former government, receiving very much assistance at all in terms of child-care facilities.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Another reason I wish to take the small time that is available to me to speak to this measure is that I have a feeling of deja vu about some of the aspects of this debate. In 1985, when I was the President of the then Shire of Whittlesea, I was in the position where, as the leader of a Labor controlled council, I found myself in dispute with the state Labor government and the federal Labor government. The basis of that was that we as a municipality had decided, as part of improving the access to child care, to build a long day child&amp;hyphen;care centre. We had the building, but we found ourselves in dispute over the operating subsidy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What was the basis of that dispute? It was the same sort of basis that we are seeing trotted out today. I went through some of the cuttings from that time. There were allegations that expenditure on child-care centres was excessive. There were allegations that, if organisations did not receive the subsidies, they would have an incentive to reduce costs. There were allegations that families would be able to pay the higher fees and that sponsoring bodies might be more capable of putting in additional moneys. The argument was false then—and it remains false.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that community child care has displayed the type of benchmarks that were necessary. At that time, in 1985, we were seeing the federal government not willing to cover the costs of the type of child care that was required under state legislation. We have had this battle. We have won this battle, and now, through this budgetary measure, we want to be taken a step back. It is wrong. It is only through community child care that we are able to give families in the suburbs that I represent access to quality child care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To now place those child-care centres under pressure is mean&amp;hyphen;spirited indeed. What are the alternatives? The alternatives are to increase fees. I would contend that for the families who use these centres it would be a great hardship and very difficult. Are we to see the
        <break page="6544" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         committees of management of these centres now look at such issues as the staff ratio of qualified staff to non-qualified staff?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As we contend in this debate, the community sector has shown the lead by having ratios that are over and above the standards set by the states. This is what people would like to see. It is a matter of choice. It is a matter of being able to choose to take their children to centres such as this. Because of the special needs of such areas as Thomastown West and Lalor West in my electorate—basic working&amp;hyphen;class suburbs—without access to community child care they would have to go back to the bad old days of backyard operators. There should also be the ability to adjust the ratio based on the age of the children who are within the centres. These things will place pressure upon the centres.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The council was able to place the centre I have been talking about in the hands of a community committee of management. It is now run not by the council but by the community committee of management. The people who are managing these centres on a voluntary basis are going to have to contend with difficult issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the minister is fair dinkum about the type of transitional arrangements that she has spoken about, I hope we will see areas such as in my electorate amongst those assisted. If this measure goes through, I am worried that these things will not be properly targeted.

        This is a very important issue and one which those opposite should listen to. They might also listen to the views of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), because they will discover that the minister actually agrees with our amendment, as it actually corrects a mistake in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. The original bill intended to give the Health Insurance Commission an open-ended power to defer making a decision about a claim for the child-care cash rebate. So, if the commission did nothing, people would not be paid the child-care cash rebate that they would be entitled to.

        That, of course, would have meant that families, parents, would have been guilty until proven innocent. That is obviously something which, I am pleased to say, the government did not intend. Nevertheless, it is a very important matter. It behoves those opposite who are carrying on to actually listen and take a bit of notice of a very important change that will make sure that we do not have to come back into this place and debate it once again.

         Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed to before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. Both parents cannot work without decently provided child care. Senator Newman, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, has conceded that child care is a legitimate work related expense. But this government, in breaking yet another promise it went to the election with, has changed its mind. What they are saying now is, `We don't think it is a legitimate work related expense. We think the whole amount spent on child care should be reduced.' Something the minister failed to mention in her remarks earlier is that this government is reducing the amount spent on child care by $500 million—$500 million that will have to come out of the pockets of parents.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On the coalition's logic, why shouldn't highly paid men who claim tax deductions for expensive tools, or lawyers who claim for their professional libraries, or politicians who claim for whatever they claim for be subject to the means test? We are not in here debating that issue because this government does not want to address this front on. It does not want to take into account that it is a legitimate work related expense, that women who work have to take out expensive child care. Certainly, with this government, they will be paying a lot more for child care. They will be paying the $500 million out of their pockets.

         What this government wants to do is make sure that we yet again have the debate which we actually solved while we were in government. What you will see come out of this decision is a claim for tax deductibility of child care—something that I would hope nobody in this House would support because of the regressive nature of such a move. The rebate recognised that child care was a legitimate work related expense, but it was not introduced in a way that gave much more benefit to those at the top end of the income

          scale and zero to those who did not earn any taxable income. This is another retrograde step, another broken promise, another message to working women that their place is not in the work force but in the home—go home, do not bother about child care. This is Howard style political correctness and we will not have a bar of it.

         —You do not know the meaning of `means test'. We have not abolished the rebate. However, the government considers that it is only fair and equitable that higher income earners make a contribution—and it is a small contribution—to their child&amp;hyphen;care costs. Under the changes announced to the rebate, families with incomes below the new family tax initiative cut&amp;hyphen;offs of $70,000 for one child, rising by $3,000 for each additional child, will continue to receive a 30 per cent rebate, while families with incomes above those limits will be restricted to a rebate of 20 per cent. This measure reduces benefits only for families in the top 20 per cent of family incomes in Australia.

        We have a great number of unmet needs out there in the community. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure equitable evenness in the distribution of child-care subsidies. I find it puzzling that the opposition is so keen to promote the interests of higher income earners but does not believe that higher income earners should draw any comfort from this stance. Labor appears to have a more sinister agenda for higher income earners, as hinted at by the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who was adamant

She has indicated that the cut&amp;hyphen;off point is $70,000. The differential treatment of families below and above that figure indicates that quite clearly a means test is being applied.

        Quite clearly, the government parties are not doing that. The government is repudiating another very clear, unqualified undertaking that was given in its own manifesto. The litany of broken promises gradually being added to by this government is bringing it into serious disrepute. It is not just a matter of political dishonesty; it is an increasing example of the way in which the Australian people were hoodwinked and were taken for mugs by this government and, increasingly, they are becoming aware of it. All of these examples will come back to haunt the coalition.

        The reason we are moving this amendment is that I want to draw the government's attention to section 60 of the substantive act which already has a considerable section to it. It is headed `Knowingly make false or misleading statements'. The penalties in that clause that go to false or misleading statements, material and all the rest of it—I will not go through the section in the act—already impose a penalty on those who seek to do the things that this bill is adding another penalty to. We will pursue the amendment on the basis that there is already a provision in the substantive act.

        The coalition has established a strategic direction for child care which is sustainable in the long term, offers greater flexibility to parents and protects the benefits of low and middle income earners while ensuring that high income earners who can afford to make a greater contribution to their child&amp;hyphen;care costs do so. The opposition's failure to support the key measures in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 reflects Labor's arro

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor believes that high income earners should be entitled to the same benefits as low income earners, that subsidies should be paid to community based care centres, irrespective of people's income, and that 220,000 families in private long day care—that is 70 per cent of families in centre based care—should be ignored and receive fewer subsidies than other families. The coalition does not accept this position and I do not believe that the majority of Australian families do either.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The measure contained in the bill eliminates Labor's inequities, treating families who use community based long day care no differently from the majority of families who use private long day care. Labor has taken a conscious decision to support the current flawed system and has run a deliberate and irresponsible scare campaign aimed at frightening parents into believing that they will be worse off because of the government's measures. Nowhere has this been better evident than in the course of this particular debate. I welcome this opportunity to repudiate many of the claims that have been made by the opposition both in this place and within the general community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the budget, the opposition has told families that, because of the removal of operational subsidy from community based long day care, services will close or fees will rise. At one point, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was claiming that fees could rise by more than $50 per week. In the course of this debate we have heard a number of case studies from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and her colleagues suggesting that all families using community based long day care will have to pay extra amounts. The member for Fremantle even cited one example where costs would go up by over $55 per week.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would strongly encourage parents to challenge claims that fees will necessarily increase, certainly to that extent, because of the government's budget measures. Families
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         cannot and should not trust the figures being touted by the opposition because every time we hear the opposition speak about these it is a different figure. It has ranged from $15 a week extra to $58 a week and beyond. They cannot be relied upon on those figures. Nor should parents accept claims by centres that they have had to increase fees because of new government policies. I am aware of at least one situation where a child&amp;hyphen;care centre has written to parents in those terms. It said:

       </para>

        This centre is increasing its fees in January, three months before any changes come into effect, and even though it is a private centre which is not affected by the removal of operational subsidy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe Australian parents must challenge the claims of many of the centres that are threatening to put up fees immediately and blaming this government's budget measures in that respect. Suggestions by the opposition that all families with children in community based long day care centres will face massive fee increases are a gross embellishment of the truth. I want to make the point that 44 per cent of families using private sector care are on maximum child&amp;hyphen;care assistance, compared with 39 per cent of families in community based long day care. It is inequitable that none of these parents receive the same level of subsidy as the parents using the community based centres. The opposition has not been able to produce a single reason to justify this discrimination.

        Throughout the course of the debate on this bill, the opposition has referred to other child&amp;hyphen;care measures that are not contained in this legislation, but I feel compelled to address those measures because there are gross misrepresentations of fact in some cases. The

         opposition has unfairly represented the 50&amp;hyphen;hour cap that will apply to child&amp;hyphen;care assistance as a disincentive to work. The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) claimed that, if parents work long hours, the Howard government is now saying that they have to pay full costs once child&amp;hyphen;care goes over 50 hours a week. Nothing could be further from the truth. This initiative places a weekly limit of 50 hours per child on the amount of care attracting child&amp;hyphen;care assistance, unless families genuinely require that extra care to meet their work related commitments. Families who use more than 50 hours of care for work related reasons, including travel time to and from study or work, training or looking for work, will continue to be able to claim child&amp;hyphen;care assistance for that care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The vast majority of families use much less than 50 hours of care per week. The average is only 26 hours. Currently, though, 22,500 families are using less than 50 hours of care but are being charged by their service providers for receiving child&amp;hyphen;care assistance for more than 50 hours. That means this government is paying out for services that are not being rendered. I do not believe any responsible government can continue to take that course. In fact, only 4,500 families use the hours that they have booked over 50 hours. It is blatantly unfair to expect Australian taxpayers to subsidise care that is being charged to the government but is not being used. In that respect, I wish to table and have included in

           —Opposition members also attacked the government's decision to give parents across service types the choice, from 1 January 1998, to have their child&amp;hyphen;care benefits paid directly to them or their child&amp;hyphen;care service. While child-care assistance may currently be paid to providers, like the child-care cash rebate, which is already paid to parents, child-care assistance is not intended to benefit services but to assist parents with the cost of their care. That is what this is all about. It is time we got back to first principles here. I find the suggestion that child-care providers will lose their certainty of funding because of this measure highly offensive. The implication is that families will not use their child-care payments to pay their child-care fees.

          The message coming clearly from the Labor Party is that the government should pay services because parents cannot be trusted to pay their bills. Why stop at child care? The logical extension of that argument, of the rationale put up by the member for Fremantle,

           is that parents should not receive any pay cheques; rather, the government should pay people's bills, because they might spend the money on something else. In other words, as the member for Fremantle said in her opening speech, parents cannot be trusted. I think that is highly offensive.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Some very important issues need to be raised in finalising this debate. We have had from the minister a discussion about the impact of the 50&amp;hyphen;hour change. It will have a very serious impact on private centres as well as community based centres. What they are all saying to me is that they will not be able to make sure that they have staff on tap, available for parents to meet their changing, flexible work needs.

        What it is going to mean is an increase in the casualisation of workers in the child-care sector. We are going to see child-care workers coming and going throughout the day. These are workers that are already on low wages. These are workers that are already highly dedicated to their task. What this measure is going to do is make their working conditions even worse. The most important thing for
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         those workers is making sure that they deliver a high quality service to the children in their care. They will not be able to do this with this change to 50 hours. It is a very serious matter. It is a matter that the private sector has raised, along with the community based sector. It is not something that can be just swept under the carpet and done away with as a budget measure. This government says that it wants to provide flexible long day care for children in this country. It will not be able to do that with the introduction of this measure.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister has also talked extensively in her comments about quality. She says that quality is assured, that accreditation will continue. I hope that means that she will repudiate the small business task force, which recommends to this government that the Commonwealth get out of accreditation, that the Commonwealth not get involved, that accreditation be left up to the market. That is not the sort of accreditation system that we want. That is not the sort of accreditation system that anybody in the child-care sector wants. It is certainly not what parents want. Not one parent in Australia would want to see the Commonwealth walk away from its commitment to the delivery of high quality child care.

        So I call on the government to immediately repudiate the Small Business Deregulation Task Force recommendation that says that the Commonwealth get out of it. I have never seen a more short&amp;hyphen;sighted recommendation as that coming from the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Of course, the government only see things from the perspective of the market. This is not a market; this is about children. This is about making sure that our children are cared for—something that we on this side of the House are proud to have stood up for and will continue to do.

         If the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, then the government should have no problems in supporting the amendment that I will be moving in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. If they do not, then they will be exposed not only for their hypocrisy but for being too smart by half.

         So this bill reaches back in time. Frankly, we have supported retrospective legislation in the past in terms of its effect. But let the government know that that is what they are doing. They are taking away existing rights and they can only do it in a retrospective fashion. So the minister's advice does not add up in relation to that because it is retrospective in effect.

That is why this legislation is unnecessary. All it does is cause further pain, further misery and further suffering to the indigenous community in

        As I say, if it were the second course you took, then that prosecution of the wrong cause was not only the support of a grand set of deceptions but deception in itself. The Labor party, from early 1994, consistently worked to have the Hindmarsh Island Bridge banned. I suspect that they thought it would look good to a certain constituency—not necessarily an Aboriginal constituency, although some Aboriginals took a ride on the coach, but really to appeal to that soft centre of political thought which will take on causes which sound as though they accord with some sympathetic or concerned view.

        The Labor Party did not oppose this bridge because it was going to harm the environment, although that argument had some merit—not overwhelming, but some merit. It did not oppose the bridge because of federal government expenditure, because there was to be none. It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state. Remember, the state government builds the bridge. The state of South Australia builds the bridge. The federal government does not build the bridge.

        It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state of South Australia after exhaustive reports and reviews which concluded that that bridge, for one reason or another, had to go ahead.

        We became aware, when we were on the other side of the House, by mid&amp;hyphen;1994 that the matter was open to very great doubt. So on 9 November 1994 we moved a motion to disallow former Minister Tickner's 25&amp;hyphen;year ban on the building of that bridge. The overriding ingredient from that moment on was that the truth of the matter seemed to be irrelevant—irrelevant not only to the federal Labor government but to the media at large, I have to say.

She was talking about the Ngarrindjeri culture, customs and language.

We pointed out that no&amp;hyphen;one but Kartinyeri seemed to have this knowledge. We pointed out that Saunders's report was categorically wrong on one fundamental point to do with Mr Justice Sam Jacobs's report. He described her view of his report on that matter as `outrageous'. We pointed out that this matter of secret women's business had never been raised, even indirectly, by anyone ever before in the context of the Ngarrindjeri people. We pointed out that the matter of secret women's business had never been raised by any of the anthropologists in respect of that much researched area and that much researched people.

        This fiasco serves as an unhappy metaphor for much that has been wrong with Aboriginal politics in Australia in recent years. Aboriginal heritage concerns were cynically exploited by people with an anti-development agenda. Influential people in the churches, the media, politics and the anthropology profession showed that they prefer Aboriginals who make adversarial claims—no matter how deceitful or ill-founded—to Aboriginals who approach their history and culture with integrity. Matters that could readily have been dismissed had key people shown a modicum of good judgment and probity require costly, politicised and unnecessarily duplicated enquiries before they can be resolved. Widespread ignorance about Aboriginal cultures allows ridiculous statements to be taken seriously, and moral posturing drowns out common sense.

        The shadow minister claims that this legislation is unnecessary. He tells us that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) should be able simply to act to authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Opinions received by the government are to the contrary. Advice from a broad range of government bodies indicates that the minister either has to go back to a further inquiry that will cost another more than $1 million or else we have to bring in this legislation. Indeed, if this legislation is not carried by this parliament, well over $7 million will have been spent proving the right of the South Australian government and the developers to construct a bridge. The advice comes from the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Office of Indigenous Affairs.

        Those opposite might have advice to the contrary, but the simple fact is that the government has received advice from very reputable legal sources. We are told that this legislation is necessary if we are to get the bridge to go ahead. People who were the original developers have gone broke because of delays. It has been found that the former government conspired with people who were prepared to do anything and say anything to prevent the bridge being constructed.

They are people who have had the guts to stand up and say that they are sick and tired of their culture being fabricated. They are sick and tired of people being prepared to do anything and say anything to stop this bridge being constructed. Isn't it terrible that a certain number of people in society, including the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, were prepared to stoop to such a tactic? They treated Aboriginal beliefs with such contempt that they were prepared to manufacture Aboriginal beliefs to prevent this bridge from being constructed. In all the times the former minister for Aboriginal affairs was tested in a court, 19 judges out of 20 found that the former minister was not handling this area of Aboriginal affairs well at all.

         The whole thrust of the debate that we have heard from the other side is that this legislation is not necessary. The shadow minister tells us that the minister should simply authorise the construction of the bridge. The minister is supposed to override the legal advice he has received. The shadow minister and the former minister have failed to tell us what would happen if the minister ignored all of the legal advice and proceeded to authorise the construction of the bridge. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that this matter would simply end up once again in the courts. There would be a continuing legal mire. There would be enormous legal expenses built up. Cynical lawyers would continue to rip off the community. They would continue to rip off Aboriginal people.

The attitude taken, though, by those opposite and the attitude taken by ATSIC in promoting the actions of former minister Tickner destroys the natural sympathy which most reasonable Australians have for the plight of Aboriginal people. It is appalling that people have the absolute hide to come in here and oppose what this government is doing. We have a program to redress Aboriginal needs. We aim to improve their health, we aim to improve their housing, we aim to improve their educational standards, we aim to make sure that ATSIC is more accountable, and we aim to make sure that moneys spent in the area of Aboriginal affairs attract the same level of accountability as other expenditure of government moneys. Yet every time that we try to do something to improve the plight of Aboriginal people, we find that those opposite, whose record is so dreadful, object to what we are seeking to do.

Let me just mention briefly that, after 13 years, 14,000 dwellings are still required to meet Aboriginal housing needs in urban, rural and remote locations. In rural and remote areas, around 41,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in such overcrowded conditions that they require additional housing. About 40 per cent of houses in rural and regional areas require major repair or replacement. That is only one area of Aboriginal affairs. I have got page after page that I could outline. But the fact of the matter is that the former government was

         Over a very long period of time they prevented the Hindmarsh Island Bridge from being constructed. We had five inquiries. Those five inquiries cost well over $6 million. The shadow minister would have us reject the legal advice we have received. He would have us simply override that legal advice. He would have the now minister authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Of course, at the end of the day, you know what would happen: the matter would go back before the court. There would be an injunction issued against the construction of the bridge. There would have to be yet another inquiry at a cost to the Australian taxpayerof more than $1 million.

         —Tomorrow it seems certain that the clock will start ticking towards the end of many fundamental award conditions for Australian workers because the Senate will be considering amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. As a result of the deal between the government and the Democrats, the Senate will undoubtedly pass section 89A of the bill and then consequential matters, following upon which there will be an 18&amp;hyphen;month timetable before all award matters for Australian workers—except what are now 20 so&amp;hyphen;called allowable matters—will disappear. All of those provisions will come under pressure from the proclamation of the bill. Any that survive the 18 months will disappear at the end of that period, unless workers can negotiate an agreement to win back conditions they already have.

        This change represents a threat to the security of working conditions for millions of Australian workers, particularly those who depend upon the award for their actual rather than merely their minimum conditions, which is about one&amp;hyphen;third of Australian workers. It also represents a breach of two election promises which—silly us—we thought were probably even core promises, that is, the first promise that no worker will be worse off and the second that no worker would have their award conditions taken away under a Howard government. Mr Howard said in October last year that no Australian worker would have their award conditions taken away under a

        In case you thought that somehow or other the deal between the Australian government and the Democrats might have protected workers in this case, it is far from the truth. All that deal does is reduce by two the number of award conditions that will be lost. That did come as a surprise to many Australian workers, particularly those who heard Senator Kernot's speech to the Australian Education Union on 15 June when she quoted Mr Howard who had said, `No worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away,' and then went on to criticise the bill saying it proposed stripping back awards to just 18 conditions.

        The minister has tried, from time to time, to come in here to trivialise the conditions which will be lost.

        Let me just refer this evening to the hospitality industry and its award. It is evident, on the face of it, that at least 16 conditions provided for under that award will disappear as a result of this legislation and the workers will have to seek to negotiate an agreement to win them back. People might argue about whether there are more that will be lost. That will be an interesting case before the commission. At least these 16 clearly will, including the section on sexual harassment and, in particular, subclause 14.1.2 of the award, which says:

        What these changes overall mean for Australian workers, many of whom think they have already had too much enterprise bargaining, is that now they will have to enter into enterprise bargaining just to win back conditions they already have. The government, after promising the opposite, takes away their conditions and requires them to enter into enterprise bargaining just to stay where they are, let alone the greater hurdles that the bill puts in their way to seek to improve their conditions, to seek to improve their living standards. The workers of Australia, who are already suffering—as the Department of Industrial Relations report says—increased stress as a result of the pressures of enterprise bargaining, are no longer going to have the choice about whether they enter that bargain; they will be required to do so just to retain existing conditions.

        The incident to which I refer is an incredible example of vilification which has cost a small business in Fairfax valuable productivity hours as well as possibly damaging its reputation and goodwill. Last week, on Thursday, 31 October, the Killyptus Products Company, owned and operated by a husband and wife team on the Sunshine Coast, received a telephone call from their pet supplies distributor in Brisbane. To the horror of these small business owners, their distributor explained that one of their products had been removed from the shelves of retail outlets on the orders of a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy inspector. They had

        Naturally, their first call was to the DPI in Brisbane. They asked why their product was being removed from the shelves of pet supply outlets and they asked the chief inspector to direct his DPI inspector in the field to stop his rounds until the position had been clarified. According to my constituent, the story then developed as follows. I quote from their letter:

        He then told me he would find out why the product was being removed and ring me back, which he did 15 minutes later. He said that he supported his officer because `we were on the NRA hit list'.

       <para>
        After discussions with the National Registration Authority, it was revealed that NRA patrols travel the country checking the wording on labels. As it turns out, an NRA representative had noticed the words `low irritant' on a bottle of their pet shampoo some 12 months earlier—a product which, by the way, has never been required to be registered with the NRA. The same label had been used by this business for five years and had not changed. It had previously been approved by the Queensland state Department of Primary Industries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The NRA then claimed that it had written to the business advising them of its concern and had received no reply. Interestingly enough, they had received regular correspondence from the NRA during the same period but this time the NRA wrote to a previous address on an old bottle. One section of NRA wrote to the correct address, another section to the incorrect address. The NRA officer then incorrectly assumed that their business had shut down and proceeded with the clearing of the shelves. This is nothing short of negligence.

       <para first-indent="16">
        During their discussions with the NRA, my constituents claim that they were told that the words in question, `low irritant', posed a problem because the claim was something that could not be proven. They said that the argument used against them was, `Dogs do

        In short, the NRA demanded that they remove all the products from the shelves of retail outlets and cross out the two words. Understandably, my constituents were stunned by this incredible suggestion. Finally, the NRA consulted a vet, and contacted the business owners the following day to advise that everything was okay after all and their product would be removed from the so&amp;hyphen;called hit list.

        In 24 hours a small business had its product removed from a pet shop retail outlet, had been told by a DPIE inspector that dogs do not talk, and then was advised that everything was okay. Well, it is not okay. I will not tolerate Gestapo style tactics being used on my constituents by bureaucratic Rambos hiding behind the legitimacy of legislation passed in the parliament.

         —Yesterday, while speaking on my private member's motion, I called on the members of this House to put away their political hatchets, jettison their political baggage and give serious consideration to the case for Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second airport—a site that, when serviced by the Sydney-Canberra very fast train, seems to me to make an awful lot of sense.

        During my time in this parliament, certainly during my 25 years of public life, I think I have been fairly up&amp;hyphen;front. I would hope that I have treated members of the opposing parties with as much candour, sincerity and honesty as I have treated members of my own party. Yesterday, in my private member's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         speech, I asked for the same sincerity and candour to be shown by the government members to the motion I put forward. I did not insist that they agree with my proposition, merely that they approach it with open eyes and a clear mind and not dismiss it out of hand.

        The member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), I am glad to see, was able to do so. I appreciated her comments made in the House last night and I warmly support her fight to move Sydney's second airport outside the Sydney basin, led most admirably by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). However, it was unfortunately not possible for the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). Not only did he denigrate my suggestions with the politically biased rhetoric and thinking I had implored members to reject but he even questioned my reasons for starting the debate. The member for Lowe claimed not only that I had ulterior and malicious motives in putting forward my motion but also that the federal parliamentary Labor Party had colluded with me in the process.
       </para>

        I reject his slimy accusations. Not only do I reject them but I feel I must address them. The member for Lowe stated in his speech:

       <para>
        What absolutely unmitigated tripe! Sydney needs a second airport, a second airport which will go some way to relieving the people of Sydney of their intolerable aircraft noise burden. What I object to is the notion that this will best be achieved by building a second international airport on the doorstep of thousands of other Sydneysiders—be it at Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy—subjecting them to the same, if not worse, noise levels. I do not wish to delay the building of Sydney's second airport any more than the hopelessly misguided member for Lowe. I just do not want to see a repeat of the mistakes that have been made at Kingsford Smith.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After he attacked my motives, the member for Lowe sought to challenge my argument with what he must believe passes as constructive debate. Unfortunately, the member for

        Why does the honourable member stop at Goulburn? Why not throw in Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong?
       </para>
       <para>
        The member for Lowe not only must have rocks in his head but must be as deaf as Helen Keller was blind. I suggest Goulburn as a site for the airport only in conjunction with a very fast train service which seems destined to be built between Sydney and Canberra, and possibly extended to Melbourne some time in the near future. Unless my geography is incorrect, Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong are not directly on the way to Canberra as Goulburn is. Perhaps the member for Lowe needs a new prescription for his glasses. Perhaps he just needs to go back to Geography 101.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Lowe states that, because Goulburn finished last in the site selection process in 1985, any further suggestion that it should be looked at again is ludicrous. If my memory serves me correctly, Holsworthy finished second last in that site selection process in 1985 and yet it has not stopped the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) thinking it worthy enough to warrant further consideration. Again, the member for Lowe lets his dim light shine—dim being the operative word.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Lowe complains that a very fast train would cost $2.5 billion to build, implying that this extra cost would be borne by the government. What has the member for Lowe been doing for these last few months? The very fast train will be financed and operated by private business—at no cost to the government. It will employ hundreds of people; it will have many positive economic spin-offs. Do the member for Lowe and the government not want this project to go ahead?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And what of his inane argument that you could not have a very fast train servicing an airport at Goulburn because families would have to spend hundreds of dollars catching

         the train to see them off at the airport? Oh please! Of course, they cannot say goodbye at the train station! That is just illogical, isn't it? Well, it is certainly too logical for the member for Lowe.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He also raises the bogus argument that Goulburn cannot be operated because the site is affected by fog approximately 50 days per year. My God, what does he think they do at Heathrow airport when a London peasouper rolls in—land the planes on Buckingham Palace? I ask the member for Lowe: what about the microwave landing system, or MLS, which will supersede instrument landing systems by the end of this decade, virtually making landing aircraft in poor conditions a non-issue? What about Lockheed Martin's autonomous precision approach and landing system which offers airlines the ability to operate in reduced visibility free of any dependence on ground based equipment? What about the CHURPs autopilot system presently being developed right here in Australia by BHP senior research scientist Dr David Stirling, which will revolutionise take-offs and landings by computer early next century?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Lowe has shown time and time again in this House his incapacity to grasp an issue and make some sense of it. I know it must be hard for him, but for the sake of his constituents and the rest of Sydney who want a solution to the aircraft noise problem I do implore him to look hard enough within himself to find the intelligence which would enable him to make a constructive contribution to this debate. Otherwise, I suggest he stays in his office and continues to watch it on his TV set.

         —I rise tonight to place on record my deep concern for the Hawkesbury River system, which forms the southern boundary of my electorate of Robertson. The Hawkesbury River system is the longest river on the east coast of Australia, being some 460 kilometres in length. It has four name changes on its flow to the sea: starting at the Mulwarry Ponds, it becomes the Wollondilly, the Warra

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have a great affinity with this mighty river, having spent most of my life either playing in or working on the river. Even today I still live on the banks of this river. Unfortunately, I spend far too little time enjoying its beauty these days. I am not unique in claiming a long history with the Hawkesbury.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This river has been a lifeline for the colony of Sydney and today it still supports a successful fishing and prawning industry hand in hand with the multimillion dollar Sydney rock oyster industry. There are many families who are third and fourth generation oyster farmers or fishermen on the river—families like the Buies, the Thompsons, the Johnsons, the Handys, the Singletons, the Davidsons, the Deas and many more who have made their living from the Hawkesbury River.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The river not only has supported these industries but is now a jewel in the crown of New South Wales tourism. Each weekend, thousands of Sydneysiders flock to the Hawkesbury River to swim, to fish—yes, the river still provides some of the best fishing around—to ski, to sail, to hire a houseboat, to enjoy a wonderful meal at one of the many restaurants in the area or just to sit and take in the breathtaking scenery.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The river is the major fresh water supply for the city of Sydney. There are a number of dams and weirs being situated on the river. Major dams in the catchment include the Warragamba Dam on the Warragamba River, which is by far the largest. The Upper Nepean system also contains four dams: the Cataract Dam, the Cordeaux Dam, Avon Dam and the Nepean Dam. The Woronora system includes the Woronora Dam and the Prospect Reservoir. There are also four small dams in the Blue Mountains catchment area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As Sydney has grown with its urban sprawl, particularly to the west and to the south-west, the environmental pressures being placed on the river system have become almost intolerable, particularly in the Nepean&amp;hyphen;Upper Hawkesbury reaches. There are currently 21 sewage treatment plants operated by the Sydney Water Board in the Hawkesbury-
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Nepean catchment. In addition, there are 20 licensed sewage treatment plants in the catchment, although their combined loads are relatively small in comparison with those from Sydney Water Board's plants.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is an appalling situation. This magnificent river will not survive if we allow this ridiculous situation to continue. We cannot expect the Hawkesbury River system to absorb the urban run&amp;hyphen;off and sewage outfall from most of Sydney without have a catastrophic effect on the water quality of the river. Thousands of people depend upon the Hawkesbury River for their livelihood and hundreds of thousands of others enjoy the amenities of the river each year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The technology is available to improve the water quality. Companies such as Memtec based in Windsor lead the world in water microfiltration systems. Other companies such as Land and Marine Environmental Researchers have developed sophisticated monitoring equipment, such as stratacam, enabling instant data on sedimentation to be collected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Already the river quality is improving. Tangible positive signs are appearing. Dolphins are again being seen in the river for the first time in many years. The fishing is improving. The prawn catches are larger and the future for the river will be bright if the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill are passed by the Senate, allowing funds to be used to continue the fight to restore this magnificent river.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If the Natural Heritage Trust is established, $85 million over five years will be provided to the national river care initiative. How can those in the other place who claim so loudly that they wish to protect our environment even consider not supporting the government's magnificent proposals to restore this and other waterways that are such an important part of our unique environment and contribute so much to our economy? I appeal to honourable senators to support the Telstra bill and provide the $1.15 billion to the Australian environment.

        All members of this House bring to this place the experience of their upbringing and their life experiences.

        But, essentially, the electorate of Scullin has many characteristics that set it apart from other electorates. It essentially epitomises many of the positive characteristics of Australia. The analysis by the Parliamentary Library based on the 1991 census reveals that 36 per cent of the electorate of Scullin were born overseas, that some 21 per cent of the population were born in southern Europe—the major source countries being Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece—and that some 4.4 per cent of the population were born in Asia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An even clearer illustration of the ethnic diversity of the electorate of Scullin is exemplified by the languages that are spoken at home—52.3 per cent of people live in homes where only English is spoken; therefore, in nearly 48 per cent of homes other languages are spoken. The major languages are: Italian, 14 per cent; Macedonian, 10 per cent; and Greek, seven per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One can understand that for a community with that degree of diversity to function properly a great degree of tolerance has to be shown. I believe that the electorate of Scullin, as a microcosm of Australia, shows that through the development of the values we hold so dear, which were epitomised by the agreement to the motion on racial tolerance in this place last week, we can build on the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         strengths of cultural diversity in a tolerant and open society.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It can also be illustrated that those people who live in such communities can show a great degree of loyalty not only to their families, not only to their local communities, not only to their ethnic backgrounds but also to their adopted country, Australia. It is with great worry that, as evidenced by the present debate that has been generated, for whatever reasons, the type of tolerance that we have learnt to live with should be questioned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The range and diversity of the electorate I live in is also illustrated by the religious background of the people. The major religions in my electorate are Catholic, 39.5 per cent, and Orthodox, 18.5 per cent. I was a member of the local council when the local Islamic community put in an application to start a community centre. That community centre has now developed into a fully fledged mosque. At the time, because it was different, some people queried whether they could learn to live with a functioning mosque. If one visits Thomastown now and sees the magnificent building that is the mosque, one can understand that that mosque was able to function because of the tolerance that abounds in the community.

        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within the electorate number only 275. If you look at the wage ranges of the people of Scullin they could consider themselves to be in the disadvantaged income bracket. When people look at the plight of Aboriginal people they know that they are at an even greater disadvantage, and they are willing to ensure that those needs are addressed.

         The report is rather interesting. The Trades and Labour Council of the ACT Inc. received $58,000. The Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union of Tasmania received $15,000. The Trades and Labour Council of the Northern Territory received $25,000. The Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council received $17,445. The United Trade Unions and Labour Council of South Australia received $43,665.

         It is interesting that the ACTU Queensland branch received $10,000. The ACTU Queensland branch received another $26,165. One has to wonder what contribution they would make to community cultural development. I would suggest that they are possibly running courses to teach their members how they can destroy public property like they did here recently at our magnificent Parliament House. I would suggest very strongly that we need to look very closely at who are going to be the recipients of this type of funding. It is specifically targeted.

In fact, from questions on notice I have asked or from information I have tried to get from the Australia Council, there has only ever been one grant to an individual from the electorate of Scullin over the last three or four years. But what the honourable member has to understand is that the Australia Council operates at arm's length.

       The population figures have been derived from the 1991 census data on the same basis as in Question 5, and may not be a reflection of actual usage or client access to claiming services. This applies particularly in the case of the Darwin office which is located in the CBD and therefore attracts considerable client traffic.

       (6) It is not possible to predict whether any of the situations outlined in the honourable member's question will occur. The Commonwealth will meet its obligations for those charged with criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation. It is a matter for each State and Territory to meet its obligations for legal aid funding for those charged with criminal offences under State or Territory law.

      <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
       The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, recognising that those people for whom the Commonwealth has traditionally had a special responsibility—the unemployed, recipients of pensions and other Commonwealth benefits, students, migrants, aboriginal people and veterans—must receive the highest priority in any such review, regardless of the different legal responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, so that people in need are not disadvantaged by any changes in the arrangements for funding legal aid, resolves that any changes to legal aid funding should be based on guidelines to be developed by State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General in conjunction with meetings of SCAG.

       My response is that the Commonwealth is no longer willing to subsidise State law matters.

       (8) I am aware of the recent comments by those mentioned in the honourable member's question. The Commonwealth believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding. I understand that Mr Bernard Bongiorno QC addressed a meeting at the Fitzroy Town Hall on 11 August 1996. In his address he said that it was not sufficient for State Ministers to blame the Commonwealth, but that the primary responsibility for legal aid lay with the State Government which should pick up the shortfall in funding.

       (9) There may be some concern in the community and the legal profession over the Government's action to change legal aid funding arrangements. It is to be expected that people who are concerned
       <break page="6605" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        about access to justice for those in need in the community would have a view on this issue. The changes that the Government has announced will ensure that the legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth law will be maintained, and will no longer be subject to the pressures faced by legal aid commissions from an increasing demand to provide assistance for criminal matters which mostly arise under State and Territory laws.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       In future it will be for State and Territory governments to decide what approach to take to deal with the issue instead of relying on what has been, in effect, a Commonwealth subsidy for State and Territory law matters.

       The Strehlow collection consists in large part of highly secret&amp;hyphen;sacred objects collected earlier this century by the late Professor T.G.H. (Ted) Strehlow. The collection supposedly had been purchased by the Northern Territory Government but it later was discovered that Strehlow's widow, Dr K. Strehlow, had retained some items.
