         Yesterday at the Press Club we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) give one of the most extraordinary addresses ever heard at that institution by a Prime Minister totally bereft of policy guidelines to solve the problems facing the Australian people. The legislation before us today, in many respects, is merely a continuum of that attitude. It is worth quoting from

        Sadly, those words have been echoed across the length and breadth of this continent for many months now and relatively little has taken place to demonstrate the Government's direction or sense of purpose to solve these fundamental problems which have been caused absolutely by the failure of its own economic and social policies.

         Effectively, the legislation before us today is the result of the Government trying to ease access to welfare payments to the people, to the young people in particular, most hard hit by this self-made recession. This legislation is directed at families and at youth. Sadly, it simply adds up to the reality that the Government is once again fiddling around the edges of the problem instead of addressing the causes. At the eleventh hour it is endeavouring to do something to ease, to some small degree, the pain, but it fails utterly to examine why we are where we are and what are the best solutions to those problems.

         Perhaps this is the fundamental difference between the approach taken by the Opposition, by the coalition, and the approach taken by this Government. The family allowance lump sum payment represents a consideration of considerable social value to most Australian families. There are now 1.25 million Australians dependent on unemployment payments. This includes over 800,000 claimants and their 245,000 spouses and 330,000 children. More than 41 per cent of these have been relying on unemployment benefits now for well over 12 months. Overall, more than 680,000 children are living in a family where neither parent has employment. Not only was this an increase of 63,000 since early 1992 but, as is pointed out in the Catholic Bishops

         General economic statistics show that the total stock of national savings was reduced last year as reserves were run down. Consequently, our demand on overseas borrowing rose inexorably. Households have responded to falling incomes by saving less to maintain their consumption levels. As also pointed out by the bishops, the pattern of wealth distribution in Australia is one of growing inequality. Moreover, inequality of income has also increased considerably over the past 10 years. Those with middle incomes have suffered a significant drop in the proportion of the national income reaching them.

         Sadly, Australia's middle income earners have been the vast majority and the ones who, to a large degree, have carried the brunt of the massive retrenchments we have seen take place in recent months. In the year to March, 180,000 jobs disappeared from Australia's private sector—a contraction of 4.2 per cent in the private sector work force alone. Employment in the private sector has fallen to 4.1 million people, a decrease of about 450,000 jobs since private sector employment peaked in late 1989.

         The FAS statistics also tell a very sad story. The number of families receiving FAS increased by more than 24 per cent in 1991-92. In June 1992 there were 241,000 families receiving FAS, for some 565,000 Australian children—an absolute record. The number of families in crisis demonstrates another set of sad statistics. Welfare agencies like the Salvation Army are experiencing an unprecedented demand for their services. They state, `Families in crisis are seeking assistance at a rate exceeding the capacity and ability of these agencies to respond. Many Australians who in the past have been able to support their family by holding down stable jobs are no longer able to do so and consequently families on low incomes are struggling to make ends meet'.

        The Government's solution to date has been limited to these two pathetic pieces of legislation. Its solution is to give families bonus payments out of the blue and to allow them to access some of their family allowance in one lump sum—in other words, the point I made earlier—desperately, to try to treat the effects of the problem but not its causes. Family allowances were intended as a supplement to wages policy because wages do not of themselves take account of family responsibilities. It was a coalition government which first introduced the concept of the family allowance. It is a concept which we have continued to support, on both sides of the House, over those years. Consequently, we certainly support this legislation today.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is important to remember that the allowance was not intended as a series of lump sum payments. We supported a Bill a few months ago, passed through this Parliament in May, which enabled the family allowance payments to be paid on alternate weeks to payments of pensions or benefits. The Government claimed at that time, and we supported that claim, that this would ensure that poorer families with children would have access to four cash payments during each month.

         This proposal provides a better cash flow and assists people who may have some difficulty in budgeting for household expenditure over a two-week period. Consequently, while we acknowledge that many families especially on welfare often face one-off debts, for example health costs or preparing children for school and so forth, nevertheless we caution the Government that any further extension of this tendency which appeared a few months ago, when the Government gave people accessing the family allowance a one-off payment—perhaps in the belief that it could bribe people by giving them a continuum of one-off payments—would result in a cutting away at the very basis of the family allowance concept as it currently works. It is meant to be a supplement to wage; it is not meant to be a series of one-off payments.

         While we are not opposing these amendments, and while we accept that there are certain circumstances, especially at times like this, when low income families in particular may face points of crisis and would like access to a lump sum—in this case quite a small one; it is only for six months at the single rate—nevertheless we would not want this to be merely the thin edge of the wedge of a general weakening of the system, as has occurred in New Zealand over recent years where the family allowance was offered for a whole host of reasons other than the purpose for which it was created. I understand that the New Zealand Government has now had to wind back that system.

         As far as the Opposition is concerned, the best form of welfare by any stretch of the imagination is the capacity to offer people a job, precisely to overcome the problems noted in the Government's own paper: the perception of young people who are facing hardship. They have the difficulty of low self-esteem and they have a feeling that they have been let down by the community. We can give people supplementary support till the cows come home; the fundamental fact is that young people, in fact all people within the work force age, want to feel that their lives have some meaning, that as individuals they have some capacity to control events in their own lives. They know too well that the only effective way that can be done is to have employment and, through employment, be able to achieve that self-esteem which so many thousands of young Australians have been totally devoid of and lacking because of government policy in recent months. That is why we will be introducing measures to help business get back onto its feet, with the fundamental objective of creating more jobs.

         I refer now to the waiting periods for access to JSA and for education leavers, which is part of the amendments before the House today. Approximately 30,000 youth under the age of 18 are on Job Search allowance. In August of this year youth unemployment—those unemployed between the ages of 15 and 19—was a horrendous 34 per cent, an absolute record since statistics have been kept in this country. That represents over three times the general level of unemployment. The sad fact is that 49,700 of last year's school leavers did not get into universities in Australia this year because there were not sufficient places.

         Youth unemployment as a proportion of youth population is still less than it was in the early 1980s. While this reflects a smaller youth labour force due to the desirable increase in youth participation in full time education, it clearly signifies a significant amount of hidden unemployment. Many young people are enrolling in school or staying in school due to the lack of available work. In the last two years the Government has made a virtue of the fact that it has increased substantially the school retention rates. Nobody disputes that. I accept the need for children to be well educated. That is a fundamental objective of the policy of the Liberal and National parties, but having kept children at school for an additional two or three years, the inevitable fact still remains that when they finally complete their secondary education, for far too many of them, some 30 per cent, there is nowhere to go. That is a reflection of the total failure of this Government's education, employment and economic policies over recent years.

        Members of the Government know, as we know, that there has to be an absolute minimum of 3 per cent economic growth a year just to create enough jobs for the natural population growth and for the school leavers. The estimates contained in this year's Budget are exactly that: they are directed at 3 per cent and they anticipate a growth of 800,000 jobs over the next four years. Sadly, that is not enough to take up the slack of the million people who are currently out of the work force, of at least an additional half a million people who have simply dropped out of the system but who otherwise would be available for work, and it significantly does not take account of the fact that an additional 140,000 to 160,000 people are coming onto the labour market each year, the majority of whom are young Australians who ask nothing more of this nation than that they should have the opportunity to make a contribution to its growth, to its success and to its standing in the world, as did their parents.

         Members of the Opposition are saying time and time again that the saddest thing before this nation is that we are passing on to our children a lower standard of living than that which was inherited by us or by our parents. That is the most diabolical demonstration of the failure of this Government over the last 10 years. The Prime Minister can stand here as he does on occasions and tell us that job participation over the last 10 years has increased. And well it might have, considering that the population over that period has grown by a couple of million people. The sad fact is that in terms of economic growth, which is the engine which drives the economy—there is no other form of growth except economic growth which creates jobs for the Australian people—the Government's solution is found to be absolutely wanting.

         Australia's record high unemployment, the highest level at any time since the Great Depression, has been caused by Labor's engineered recession. It is also due to wages costs and inappropriate wage relativities. The Government and the ACTU continue to deny the relevance of wage costs and those rigidities in creating the current crisis, a crisis which, above all, has kept out of the labour market thousands upon thousands of school leavers and is driving out of the labour market thousands upon thousands of middle-aged Australians aged 45 and above. They are the people who are demonstrating the period of longest unemployment and they are the people which government policy continues to ignore. Sadly, therefore, the Government continues not to address the wages issue in planning an overall solution to these problems. For that reason the Government's Youth Forum, which is the basis for some of this legislation, was virtually useless. It talked about increasing training positions, increasing subsidised jobs and funding for environmental programs.

We are now going through a period of Australia's economic cycle, which could go on indefinitely, when a significant proportion of the population will have access at best to part time or temporary work. That is the work which we now have to identify and relate to the mix of our welfare programs. Regrettably, the Government has not yet taken that on board adequately.

We expect that in our first two years of office we should be able to create at least 100,000 jobs with wages at that youth training wage level. We will also supplement this training wage by issuing training vouchers and guaranteeing that no young person will be worse off than if he or she had stayed on Job Search allowance. These proposals will create real jobs and give employers an opportunity to give young school leavers that first job opportunity which is so critical to getting one's feet on the ladder of economic self-sufficiency. They will also reduce the need of young people to have faster access to Job Search allowance, which the Social Security Amendment Bill is proposing.

         The package we put to the Australian people in July this year was the most comprehensive addressing of these issues that any Opposition has presented in Australia's recent history. This is because the magnitude of Australia's unemployment problem is of such fundamental concern to all of us. I often wonder how members on the Government side, who claim to be representing a Party that looks after the interests of the working people of Australia, are able to look at themselves in the mirror of life and look at their own constituents and honestly say that in the last 10 years they have governed this country in the interests of those people. Quite clearly, the evidence is there for all to see. It has been the failure of this Government over that period that has led to this situation.

         If we compare Australia with the rest of the world, in particular with the OECD, we see that the sad fact is that in 1970 we had an unemployment rate equal to half the OECD average and that today it is one of the highest in the OECD. We know there has been a collapse in full time employment, affecting males more than females, and since July 1990 the number of part time jobs for full time work has been much greater than in previous recessions. This is not surprising given that the recession is the worst, as I said, for 60 years and that on-costs, which have a fundamental effect on whether one employs that extra marginal unit of labour, have continued to increase in recent years.

         Sadly, in that context, youth unemployment reached a record of 35.8 per cent in June 1992. As I said earlier, it is three times the unemployment rate for those aged 20 and over. Sadly, there is further hidden youth unemployment with many young people who would prefer to work being forced to stay at school or in training institutions. Around 300,000 Australians have been unemployed for over a year, and half of this number are over 35 years of age.

         In February 1992, the 797,000 people receiving unemployment benefits had about 546,000 dependants, including 327,500 relying on unemployment benefits. It has approximately doubled over the past two years to 1.3 million people or 7 per cent of the total Australian population. We know what the causes of the unemployment crisis are: Labor's engineered recession, wage costs and inappropriate wage relativities. They are the two fundamental problems and they are the two issues on which this Government, linked as it is with the ACTU and the trade union movement, demonstrates yet again the tendency of the last 10 years to work on the basic principle of big government, big business and big unions. But between those three legs of its fundamental support base lies the vast majority of the Australian people. Of that vast majority now the Government has at least 1 1/2 million people who are not in the labour market but wish to be there. They wonder what the future is going to hold for their children if current policies continue. It is perfectly clear that it cannot be a successful future unless there is a fundamental change in the direction of this nation—a change which this Government has demonstrated more than clearly its inability and its unwillingness to address.

         As I said earlier, there are now 167,000 young Australians aged between 15 and 20 receiving the Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance. We believe that it is necessary to provide appropriate welfare and support arrangements to ensure that those on youth training wages and the Austrain program which we will initiate in government are not disadvantaged in terms of their transition from the social welfare system. For those living at home, the minimum youth training wage would pay significantly more than the current Job Search allowance. For those under 18, the $114 minimum wage rate is approximately 78 per cent higher and, for those under 20, 69 per cent higher, than the JSA rate, providing a real incentive to get off unemployment benefits and into a job.

         For those members of the Government who spent so much time back in July talking about sweat wages and forcing people into jobs of this nature, it is amusing that when, within weeks of our announcement, the Prime Minister finally came out with his package. The actual bottom line difference between our youth training wage and the Government's package was 77c a week. After all that noise, all that performance, all that effort to frighten everybody, and all that determination to demonstrate how the Opposition was made up of ogres who had no objective in mind other than to destroy the future of the youth of Australia, the best the Government could come up with was a differential of 77c. The difference between the Government's figure and ours is this: we have said quite clearly that this is a minimum training wage, with emphasis on the word minimum.

         This is of fundamental importance because it is the mixture of on the job training supplemented by academic or technical training which will determine, in time, the overall success of our young Australians in being able to compete, not just in the Australian labour market but also in the international labour market. The point which the Opposition continues to emphasise in this House and elsewhere is that Australia must be able to compete with the rest of the world. We must be in a position where world best practice is applied in Australia, whether it be in training programs, education programs or the way in which we work and, above all, in the levels of productivity which must be obtained from that level of work.

         These are the directions in which we want to take Australia. They are different from those of this Government. This Government, as we saw yesterday at the Press Club, is led by a Prime Minister who has nowhere to go and nothing to offer. He spent the whole half-hour at the Press Club condemning, attacking, complaining, whingeing and whining about a set of policy principles outlined in Fightback. This is the document which will lead Australia forward at a time when the best the Government can do is carp about the policies of an Opposition when, as the Prime Minister demonstrated yesterday, it has nothing to offer in its stead. They are not my words or my sentiments; they are the words of those who listened yesterday.

         —Nothing delineates us quite so clearly from the Opposition as the matter that is the subject of the Social Security Amendment Bill. We are indeed poles apart. This amendment to the Social Security Act is typical of this Government and its ability to respond to people. This amendment is known within Caucus as the Crawford amendment. It should really be known as the Forrester amendment, after a person on my staff, Colleen Forrester. How did this come about? Quite simply, in April this year with the one-off family allowance payment to many families, for the first time many people said that they found themselves in a position to be able to spend a deal of money on winter clothes, school books or other larger items which they had been unable to purchase previously.

         This proposal—the idea of flexibility and the option of being able to pay family allowance in a block or simply fortnightly—was then taken to the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is currently at the table. His ability and compassion were demonstrated in that he was able to respond to the demands of people at large. That is why we have before us today a Social Security Amendment Bill which enables families to make a choice about the way in which they will receive that family payment advance. That is how this proposal came about. It shows the Government's ability to respond to people's demands and to do so with speed and flexibility. We are very definitely about the intervention of government. We are about ensuring that people's needs and entitlements are met.

         Of course, Opposition members cannot make a speech in this House without, yet again, decrying the fact that young people are staying on at school. What a wicked, wicked thing it is that the poor should want to stay on in years 11 and 12 when previously this was only the prerogative of the rich! Somehow it was all right if one was tory and one's parents had money. Then one could stay on in years 11 and 12. That is a choice those people have made routinely.

         We understand the bottom line in all of this. As I remind honourable members in this House constantly, adults in Queensland over 42 years of age have not even had a high school education because they went to year 8 and did the Scholarship exam, which was later abolished. Honourable members should look at the facts and figures and ask themselves why we have middle aged men in Queensland with so little formal education who are now finding themselves in the unemployment queues because they do not have the skills to meet the needs of the twenty-first century in Australia. It is because formal schooling for very many people in that 40 to 50 age range finished at years 5, 6 and 7 when they went out into these dead end jobs which are espoused by the shadow spokesperson for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).

Do not tell me that that is fantasy land, because we on this side of the House know and understand that that was what life was like for many people in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

         We also hear great discussions about the size of the participation rate and the work force and some of the changes that are brought about by changes to the waiting time in education leaving periods. I will give honourable members a few facts about the participation rate in other countries. In this country, our participation rate is somewhere around 64 to 65 per cent. In the USA, it is 54 to 55 per cent and in Europe it is in the high forties. That is the difference. In Australia, irrespective of gender or age, people expect and have demanded the right to work. It is indeed their right.

         Honourable members should go to other places and have a look at them. They will see that in some places there is no equal pay for women—in fact, there is not even an opportunity for very many married women to work. In a whole range of places, participation and the right to work are not acknowledged; nor are people paid unemployment benefits. European participation, at somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent less than in the work force in Australia, creates a different kind of unemployment situation. One can also perhaps espouse the American situation. I remind the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that the population of Queensland—three million people—sleeps on the streets of Washington on any one night under the great Republican President.

When Opposition members examine the facts about the ways in which we as a government address the issues of youth unemployment, our social security system, our education system and leavers waiting periods, as well as the opportunities we provide for young people in our training areas, skill share programs, TAFEs and universities, they will have cause to worry. Let me tell them that out in the community Australians know and understand that a tory government means that they will pay full up-front fees for their university and TAFE courses. Skill share programs will no longer be there. Employers understand that the privatisation of the CES means that they will have to pay—user pays. When honourable members opposite look at the JSA for young people, when they look at applications and the kind of support we as a government philosophically continue to believe is the right of every Australian—to have access to income support and to have family payments paid to them in a way which they will use and choose and develop for the betterment of their families—there is no question about the way they will feel.

The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) told us that the Opposition would cut family allowance payments.

Young people whose mothers happen to be sole parents will have no income whatsoever because these children will be over 12. A whole range of people will be affected.

         The honourable member for Forde comes in here and talks like a socialist: she cares for the workers; she cares for the downtrodden. I do not want to cast aspersions on honourable members and their rights but I want to expose hypocrisy when I hear it. The honourable member travels first class and she drives around in chauffeured limousines. So do I, and I acknowledge that. I will stand up for the rights and the benefits that members get for doing a very onerous job. But I want to expose hypocrisy when I hear it from the so-called socialists on the other side of the House. If those opposite are fair dinkum about what they stand for then let me see some real evidence of it. I do not see any. I hear people such as the honourable member for Forde standing up here espousing socialism and claiming to have those so-called values, but let us see some demonstration of it. Otherwise let us not hear this sort of talk at all.

Somebody has said, `Why would women want to be equal with men?  Is that not taking a step backwards?'. For the honourable member for Forde to talk as she did trivialises this important debate.

         We are dealing with two Social Security Amendment Bills this morning. I am particularly interested in Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2). It is ironic that this Government should be talking about introducing legislation to help families. The Government will not wriggle out of the fact—even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at his best in this place will ultimately not be able to escape the fact—that this Government has wreaked havoc on the families of Australia in the past 10 years. This Government's record speaks for itself in that respect.

I say to the Prime Minister that we will also take the opportunity every day between now and the next election to make the point that this Government is responsible and culpable for the damage that has been caused to Australian families over the past 10 years.

         The Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) says in his second reading speech on Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) that this new lump sum family payment `will assist in family budgeting'. Despite what the honourable member for Forde says about the payment, it will not do that at all. That is drawing an extremely long bow. Regular monthly instalments, for which most families would probably opt anyway, given the option, already do that quite adequately. To be technical about it, in many respects that regular payment assists family budgeting more than dipping in for a one-off payment that is brought forward would.

We get a clue for the real motivation for this legislation in the Minister's speech when he talks about `the outstanding success of the family allowance bonus paid earlier this year'. That was the sudden one-off payment that went out to people who were entitled to it across Australia and that cost the Government $300m in one go.

Two years ago the Government had a balanced Budget, but now we are back into the $14 billion and $15 billion deficit level—talk about financial expertise! We do not see much of it on that side of the House. I ask: is this proposal to allow the bringing forward of family allowance just another grubby little bribe? As the pension is to be increased in January, is that the precursor to a post-January election? I think so. I think that the opportunity that will be given to people to dip in and bring forward their family allowance to a one-off lump sum after January probably gives us some further clues to the Government's real strategy in this regard. I ought to say that the Opposition is not opposing this.

It did not take too long for people to realise that this little one-off payment may have been the Government's motivation to people to go out and spend it. Retail sales would then go up by $300m, more or less, and it would come in and tell us that the recovery was under way because retail sales were once again buoyant. Once again, thinking people—I believe there are a lot of thinking people in Australia—do see through these grubby little exercises.

         The Government and the Labor Party have an appalling record on families. That is really what this legislation is about. The Minister says in his speech that this legislation aims to help families. One outstanding legacy of the Whitlam Government is the Family Law Act which has led to a huge escalation in divorces since 1975. I blame the Labor Party for that. I am pleased that at the moment the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act is looking into the matter. I believe it will ultimately lead to some very good recommendations. The fault that has flown from that legislation is a legacy of the Whitlam Labor Government. As I have said, we have experienced considerable family breakdown as a direct result of that. The cost of divorce is estimated to be around $2 billion per year. Family law counselling is directed at conciliation and divorce, not reconciliation of marriage. That is just one example of an anti-family bias that I believe has existed in the Labor Party for a long time. I am looking forward to some improvements in that particular Act as a result of that inquiry.

Is there any direct encouragement in the system for them to do so? I do not believe there is enough encouragement. If the Government wants to take on a debate on a substantive issue, let me put it in these terms: why does the Labor Party continue to fund abortions through Medicare? That is a tough one. Government members will have the opportunity to debate that matter in this place when we deal with a private member's Bill introduced by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) which would prevent that from happening. Abortion is anti-family. It is something that I feel very strongly ought to be debated in this place. It is up to the Government to allow it to be debated.

The honourable member for Moreton and I have debated this matter before. The Government has gone way down the track in recognising de facto relationships.

The encouragement of single parenthood is another anti-family position the Government has taken. It has made it easier and easier for single parents to exist. I am not saying that I am not compassionate enough to recognise that there are young women who are caught in that position who need to be taken care of, but we need to be very careful that the systems we put in place do not encourage that activity.

Fortunately, there will be a coalition government in this country by then—I hope there will be; otherwise I am not sure where we will be going. Assuming that there is a coalition government in place in 1994, we can expect great things from that year. Some of the objectives of that year, the key issues that have been discussed in the United Nations documents, are very exciting indeed. For instance, they talk about the family's role in the moral strength of society through the socialisation of children; the responsibilities of caring; the family's caring function; helping women and men combine family and vocational responsibilities; family violence and the need for protection and prevention; and the role of the family in teaching children values and behaviour that exemplify the equitable sharing of male and female roles.

This legislation does not necessarily demonstrate that because, as I have said, it does not matter whether the payment of the family allowance is in a lump sum or monthly.

In this debate today on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) the honourable member for McPherson has brought in a whole lot of extraneous matter, absolutely nothing to do with the legislation. But I am more than happy to respond to his particular challenge to talk about the Labor Government's commitment to families as that is one of the areas of which we are most proud; we have a very proud record in government of achievements to assist families.

         The honourable member for McPherson should look back in history at what his coalition government did for families and compare that with what this Government has done. For instance, in this legislation today we are dealing with family allowance payments. The coalition government sat back and allowed the real value of them to decline. It never increased them. It made an initial payment but never increased it with inflation. Those opposite allowed inflation to run rampant but never increased the allowance to keep pace with inflation. So the real value of those child endowment payments, as they were called then, declined considerably.

         It was not until this Government came to power that we restructured the family allowance payment and gave it a considerable boost so that families now really do get a substantial level of income support to assist them with the additional costs of raising children. Not only have we restructured the family allowance payment so that it is a meaningful payment to assist families; we have also introduced an additional payment to help those low income families meet their real needs. That is called the family allowance supplement. I challenge the honourable member for McPherson to go and talk to the families in his electorate who receive that payment. I can assure him that they will all tell him that they are very appreciative of the family allowance supplement payment because it enables them to meet all the additional costs of raising a family.

         —I was responding to the honourable member for McPherson's challenge as to what we have done for families, and looking at this legislation as part of a total package to assist families. We must look at the Austudy payment as financial support for families because Austudy does enable students to continue their secondary education and therefore have some opportunity of going on to tertiary education. It helps the families with the cost of the children staying at high school. If we had not provided that support through Austudy, many families would not have been able to afford to allow their students to complete secondary schooling. That is very important assistance for families.

It means that all Australian families are able to comprehensively insure their families so that they are not out of pocket when they face medical problems.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact is that the family allowance payments will be greatly eroded when families have to pay additional amounts of money, additional taxes, on all their food, clothing and services. In fact, those opposite would have to make some substantial increase in the family allowance and the family allowance supplement—way beyond what is proposed in Fightback—to pay for the additional costs. There is nothing more anti-family that I have ever heard of from any political party in this country than the GST because of what it will do to destroy family incomes and the capacity of families to provide for their children.

         As the honourable member for McPherson has indicated, we are talking about two specific proposals to amend the Social Security Act. The first one that I would like to talk about relates to the amendments to the education leavers waiting periods. This will make a substantial improvement in the opportunities for young unemployed people to access income support arrangements within the community. The main purpose of the education leavers waiting periods is to encourage young people, particularly secondary school students, to remain in education by generally denying them access to income support during the long summer vacation.

         The Social Security Amendment Bill introduces four modifications to the existing education leavers waiting period provisions in the Social Security Act of 1991. Allowing periods of part time and casual work to be taken into account when calculating a reduction in the ELWP will provide an incentive for young people to participate in the work force, even if only on a part time or casual basis, and thereby develop an early attachment to the work force. At present only full time work can be taken into account. We are now amending this so that part time and casual work can also be taken into account. That will provide an incentive for students to raise some of their own income.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If, for example, a young school leaver were subject to a 13-week waiting period and worked, say, for 35 hours part time in the first two weeks of those 13 weeks, those 35 hours would reduce the waiting period by a week. Each additional seven hours worked over and above the 35 hours would reduce the waiting period by a day. So we are providing an incentive for young people to seek out part time and casual employment because it will reduce the waiting period that they have to face before they can go on to other levels of income support.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          For a number of reasons young school leavers are sometimes unaware of the need to register with the CES and apply for the Job Search allowance. This is because they may be badly informed of the requirements, often through word of mouth from other school leavers, may be unsure of their future education plans, or may simply misunderstand their obligation to register and apply. There have been outreach activities by the Department of Social Security, such as school visits, which have been successful in assisting young school leavers to understand their social security rights and responsibilities. I think this is a pattern that we need to encourage and increase.

         The first change in the Bill is expected to benefit some 2,000 young people who gain part time or casual employment, and it will cost an estimated $1.4m in 1992-93. The second change addresses the problem of the 13-week waiting period applicable to secondary school leavers, and it will commence from the day after they cease education or on 15 February in the following year, whichever is the earlier. This will, in a way, protect young school leavers from missing out on income support due to their ignorance or misunderstanding of the current requirements. Currently, Job Search allowance and sickness allowance claimants who leave full time education of at least six months duration must serve a waiting period of 13 weeks for single people under 21 without dependants and six weeks for others.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The third amendment will provide that a waiting period will not need to be served when an income support recipient undertakes a course of education of six months or more but returns to income support within 12 months of cancellation of the earlier social security payment. This change will provide an additional incentive for Job Search or Newstart recipients to undertake longer term education without having to serve another waiting period.

         The final change will enable a person subject to a waiting period who qualifies for special benefit to go straight onto the Job Search allowance. At present, such a person would be subject to the stringent special benefit income test and be transferred to Job Search at the end of a waiting period. Being required to satisfy the more stringent income test during the waiting period could dissuade people from taking up part time or casual employment. All of these changes are designed to reduce the waiting periods for young unemployed people who have left full time education and who may be seeking to go on to Job Search while they are looking for full time employment. It will enable them to have a much greater opportunity to access the training and income support programs provided through DEET.

         The other part of the Bill is related to, as the honourable member for McPherson pointed out, the lump sum advance on family allowance. The honourable member for McPherson tried to outline some great conspiracy theories about the motivation behind this, but he does not understand that this is simply a measure to introduce greater flexibility. The great success of the additional payment that we made in April was that it enabled families to pay off the sizeable bills that often confront them from time to time during the year, particularly bills that relate to family expenses such as for clothing and the schoolbooks that they need to get their children into higher education or even into the non-compulsory secondary education sector.

         What we are trying to do here is give families much greater flexibility so that, if they choose—and the major point that we need to stress is that it is a choice for them; they can opt to seek it or they can choose not to—to ask for a certain amount in a lump sum they can then use that amount to pay off a large bill at any one time. We are not saying that we will give them all their family allowance at once. There is a limit—a maximum of $136.50—that they can take, but it means that at least they will be able to use that amount of money to pay off a sizeable bill at that time. The rest of the family allowance will still be paid to them in that monthly instalment so that they can use it for the ongoing costs of feeding and clothing their families. It will allow them to budget, knowing that twice a year they are able to get that lump sum and use it to pay off specific bills. I think this measure emphasises the flexibility that we are trying to introduce into our income support programs.

         This Government recognises that the comprehensive network of income support programs managed through the Department of Social Security meets the needs of some 4 1/2 million people. To adequately manage such a program, and to provide for the range of different needs that exist within that client group, the processes and programs that we implement have to be more flexible. This strategy of providing families with the chance to take part of their family allowance in a lump sum twice a year is a clear demonstration of that flexibility.

         I recognise that the Opposition is not opposed to it, but it always tries to score cheap political points and make out that there is some conspiracy surrounding this. There is no conspiracy. It is a measure that has been widely accepted throughout the community and throughout the interest groups that are involved with the social security system. They have all supported it and believe that it is a worthwhile measure. I believe that this House should give its full support to it. It is quite consistent with the Government's social justice strategy, and it demonstrates a continued commitment to provide support for families that is much more accessible and which will enhance their lives and their capacity to meet the needs of their families. We need to provide an income support program which gives added incentive for families to improve their budgeting and their capacity to meet their various needs as they arise during the year.

         I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about another measure that was included in the social security element of the Budget, and it is something that we will be proposing legislation on in the near future; that is, the extension in the Budget of fringe benefits to part pensioners. I believe that was also a very important part of the social security package contained in the Budget, as this measure will greatly enhance the opportunities for older Australians. I am one of a number of people on both sides of the House who have been seeking such an extension of fringe benefits to part pensioners, and I am delighted that the Government has been able to accede to our requests and include this provision in the Budget announcements.

         This will go a long way towards improving the situation for many part pensioners, as has been stated in this House by a number of people. Pensioners, particularly part pensioners who receive some of their income from investments, have suffered because of declining interest rates. Their investments are no longer earning the amount of money that they previously were. The fall in interest rates has benefited the vast majority of Australians, but those who rely on interest for their income have suffered. This Government has recognised that point by extending all fringe benefits that operate within the Commonwealth sphere—and that mainly relates to the health services that are provided and telephone assistance plus assistance from the National Acoustic Laboratory—to those people who are only part pensioners, who get part of their income from private sources and part from the social security system. That will greatly improve their actual standard of living.

         There is another measure that I think we need to be considering which I have raised with the Government, as have a number of other members, and that is the need to examine closely the taxation arrangements for all retired Australians. At the moment pensioners have a concessional tax threshold which is higher than the normal tax threshold, but that is applicable only to pensioners. Many of my constituents who are self-funded retirees have said to me that they believe it is a discriminatory practice that one set of older Australians is eligible for a higher tax threshold than another set of older Australians. They believe that this matter needs to be closely examined by the Government.

If we are going to have a fair social security system, a fair retirement income system in this country for all older Australians, we need to make sure that there is no discrimination in that practice.

         The two major amendments that we are dealing with today are good news for Australians. They are good news for people who have finished schooling and who are about to enter the work force, and good news for all families because they will give them greater flexibility. I commend the Government for introducing these measures. I particularly commend the Minister at the table, the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), for his initiative in implementing these family allowance amendments because I think they show a greater level of creativity and flexibility in the implementation of government income support programs. I believe we will find that a lot of Australian families will take the option of being paid a lump sum. The payment that we made in April demonstrates that there are particular times during the year when families need that lump sum extra payment to help them get over certain large bills. I think that the vast majority of families will access this additional system that we have provided and make use of the family allowance lump sum. I commend the amendments to the House.

         What do these proposed changes to the family allowance mean for Australian families? The legislation puts into effect a Budget proposal to enable people on the family allowance to request lump sum advances for half their family allowance entitlements at the one child rate for six months up to a maximum of $135.85. Of course, this means that the regular fortnightly payments would be reduced accordingly, but this measure, by providing lump sum payments, undoubtedly will help some people who might be having difficulty budgeting for regular household bills or unexpected financial burdens such as health expenses.

Some 14,000 people are classified as `discouraged job seekers'. In other words, they have simply given up looking for work, often after months of actively pursuing employment, often with hundreds of applicants for each job vacancy. A further 5,000 Western Australians are recorded as actively seeking work but are unable to start within a four week period. Because of this they are not officially classified as unemployed.

This translates to an unemployment rate of not 11.5 per cent as per the official Government statistics but a staggering 13.4 per cent. Furthermore, this figure does not include the number of unemployed people in job training schemes or small business owners and farmers who are working for no income or, worse still, at a loss. It would not surprise me if the genuine unemployment rate in Western Australia was around 15 per cent and it is only a couple of months before the next year's school leavers start to flood onto the job market and swell the ranks of the unemployed.

         The Liberal-National coalition will not oppose these changes, but it is particularly interesting to consider our alternatives for assisting Australian families, especially those on low incomes. We start by considering the family allowance scheme itself, which we accept has become a valuable supplement to a family's take-home pay. The coalition's Fightback plan offers significant real help for families, including a doubling of the family allowance payments for families on less than $30,000 a year and a range of other benefits.

         This means that, whereas the Government's changes next January will enable a family on less than $30,000 to obtain lump sum payments of $135.85, Fightback would double this amount. In fact, on current rates the family in this situation would be able to receive a lump sum payment of $271.70 under Fightback. Quite clearly, this will be of far more direct assistance than the amount being offered by the Government.

         Other households on higher incomes will also benefit under Fightback. Our intention is to give most assistance to low income earners who have been hard hit by a decade of Labor and Labor Government incompetence; for example, families on an annual income of between $30,000 and $40,000 will be eligible for a six monthly lump sum payment of $203.78 under Fightback compared with $135.85 under the Government's proposals. Even those relatively well off families on incomes of up to $55,000 will gain, as their lump sums will be paid at the rate of $146 rather than the Government's $135.85 payment. The bottom line is that the coalition's alternative for low income families is literally twice as good as the Government's scheme.

         The benefits for Australian families planned under Fightback go much further, as I have described. Families with working parents will be much better off when the coalition's income tax cuts are introduced and their take-home pay is increased significantly. Indeed, Fightback will slash personal income tax by around 30 per cent, saving Australians a massive $13 billion. The tax free threshold will be raised, freeing at least another 320,000 low income earners from having to pay tax at all. Marginal tax rates will be much lower so that an average employee will be able to earn considerably more money without paying a higher tax rate. For example, a person on a typical wage of $25,000 currently pays tax at a marginal rate of 38c in the dollar, whereas under Fightback he or she will pay tax at a rate of only 30c in the dollar.

         Furthermore, the same person could even double his wage—not by a secret tax agenda, I might add—at the 30 per cent rate under the Fightback plan, compared with 46 per cent under the Government's present tax scales. It is no wonder that so many Australian workers are reluctant to work overtime to help support their families when, for example, they know that nearly half their extra earnings will be taken in tax.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Fightback gives them the initiative to work that overtime by rewarding them with lower tax rates, so that their take home pay will be far greater. Our commitments to double family allowances, to increase the family allowance supplement by 6 per cent, and to index the dependent spouse rebate, are other examples of our commitment to the financial well-being of Australian families. So, too, is our plan to scrap fuel excise, thereby reducing petrol prices by around 19c a litre, or $11 for every tankful of fuel for the family car.

         Our decision to put aside $90m for increased child-care support is particularly important for many families with both parents in the work force, and who are currently finding it hard to find suitable child-care for their children. Fightback is totally pro-family. This is firmly demonstrated in our new approach towards health policy, which gives generous tax credits for lower and middle income families to help them afford the benefits of private health cover insurance. For example, families on very low incomes, of below $12,000, will be eligible to a credit of $400 annually. Furthermore, the cost of health care will actually fall under the full impact of the Fightback plan. So while the Government tinkers around with the family allowance scheme, the coalition has come up with a comprehensive package to assist Australian families in a variety of ways.

         Another example of how Fightback helps families is by reforming the education system. We believe that parents should be able to play a greater role in the education of their children. Consequently, the emphasis will be on a change from the system which funds the institutions to one which is more responsive to the needs of the individual. In turn, this will promote the quality of education, further strengthening the family unit.

         Australian enterprises desperately need a reduction in operating cost to improve their viability and, in many cases, to prevent actual bankruptcy. Instead, the Government has fired a barrage of new costs at the business sector, including the superannuation guarantee charge, which will add 3 per cent to payroll costs, rising eventually to 12 per cent. It has been estimated that this will result in 60,000 to 100,000 jobs losses over time.

         Certainly, from my discussions with a range of business proprietors, I am aware of many instances whereby businesses cannot support these extra costs and, as a result, must allow some employees to go. Businesses have cut their own operating costs to the bone to keep afloat. These extra costs cannot be absorbed in any other way. It is hardly the way to promote job security and to assist families. As well as that, there is the ridiculous training levy, which will do little to promote a comprehensive national training effort, but which has impacted adversely on business cash flows.

         The fuel excise tax, which now raises $7.26 billion in revenue from private and business motorists, imposes significant costs on the business sector, as do other taxes, such as the wholesale sales tax and the capital gains tax. The answer to reducing business costs and generating new employment opportunities is to ease this burden on business. This is why the Fightback plan abolishes fuel excise, scraps sales tax, gives capital gains tax concessions, throws the training levy out the window, and pegs the superannuation guarantee charges at the rate applicable at the next election. All in all, seven taxes on business will be abolished, and total savings of $20 billion will be passed on. One tax which will go completely, of course, is payroll tax. This is nothing more than a tax on employment, which has contributed towards the nation's current unemployment crisis. There is no rhyme or reason to why payroll tax can be supported any longer, but there are plenty of good reasons for getting rid of it.

It would show genuine courage if she were at least to put the interests of Western Australians before her own political objectives by enabling bipartisan support for the aim of the coalition's Fightback plan—to abolish payroll tax.

         Today's legislation is tinkering at the edges. Meaningful inroads cannot be made until the reforms that I have mentioned earlier are put into place. Also, to encourage youth training and employment, it is essential to reform the nation's industrial relations system, which all too often discriminates against young people. For example, why would a hotel manager employ an inexperienced 21-year-old when the present system requires the same wage to be paid as if the employee had been an older and more experienced person. This is just one anomaly in the system which discriminates against youth, and has helped create a vacuum in youth employment.

He said that he agreed with the legislation but then went on with the usual diatribe as to how the world would be a much better place in which to live with the Opposition in control. How all this is going to happen, I do not know. How all of a sudden the Opposition is going to create two million jobs, I do not know. It will certainly not be by imposing a 15 per cent goods and services tax. The shadow Minister suggested that under an opposition government all these particular improvements that we are putting into the social security system would not be necessary, simply because their government could create two million jobs and all the rest of it.

It is not as if we are Robinson Crusoe in terms of unemployment. There is a recession throughout the world. But how do we respond as a government? We try to do something. We try to bring in further improvements in social security and other areas so that those people who are affected by the recession, those people who are on low incomes and those who are finding it difficult to live with children will find their lives a little bit easier. We do this by bringing in initiatives of the kind that are the subject of these Bills. What would the Opposition do? The Opposition would scrap a lot of the things that we are doing now. The Opposition would bring in the $3.50 youth slave wage; it would privatise the Department of Social Security; it would throw out the unemployed after nine months on the Job Search allowance and tell them that they have to go and find a job even if there are no jobs.

         The last speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), talked about the Fightback proposals for family allowance as if they were going to be some big deal. All of a sudden these families are going to be rich because of Fightback, that magic document which is going to fix everything. Let us have a look at the Fightback proposals in so far as they affect the question of family allowances. Those opposite would introduce tough income testing arrangements, slashing the upper income limit for family allowance from $64,000 to $55,000 for a family with one child. In this scenario, some 107,000 families would lose under the Opposition's proposals—and this is just a conservative estimate.

         Given the cost of raising children, many double income families would lose, especially when faced with the increasing expenses of child-care. Around 90 per cent of families with children are presently eligible for family allowance compared to only 75 per cent who would be eligible under Fightback. That means 15 per cent of Australians would have food taken out of their mouths or out of the mouths of their children. Of course, that number has a certain ring to it. Those opposite would knock off 15 per cent of families who are trying to feed their kids and lay on an impost of 15 per cent in the form of a tax that would take more food out of the mouths of the needy and put it in the mouths of the well off. Under Fightback those remaining on the family allowance would face a more complex means test which would be difficult to administer and difficult for families to understand.

         On the other hand, in recent years this Government has dedicated itself to simplifying the process of delivering social security services to its clients, as is demonstrated by the integration of the family and child payments into one payment as and from 1 January next year. The Opposition's proposed changes to family allowances would introduce significant poverty traps for families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000.

The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) will help people during their times of need by improving client services, which I will talk about in a second—in this case giving families a much needed advance to buy school books, uniforms and other items that come in a cluster at a particular time of the year.

         The honourable member for Forrest brought up another matter which I need to address. It did not really have a lot to do with this issue. Nevertheless something needs to be pointed out. He talked about all these taxes that marvellously all of a sudden are going to be abolished because of Fightback. I note that the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) has come into the chamber. I do not think the honourable member, a good fellow, believes in the Fightback package either, but I am glad he is here. I would like to talk about the abolition of one of those taxes, the fuel excise. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) is running around the country all the time saying, `Don't worry about zero tariffs, et cetera, because we are going to knock out the fuel excise'. Let us be realistic about this fuel excise. It is something people need to think about. The figure those opposite talk about is something like a saving of 19c a litre. Does anyone really believe that, should that mob opposite get into government and abolish the fuel excise, the oil companies will not come in for their chop? Does anyone really believe that those greedy oil companies, some of which have economies probably as big as the whole of Australia, will not come in and say, `Oh, the Government has given us a bit of a bonus, 19c a litre off fuel. Can we get our grubby little hands on it?'. How often do we go around to service stations and see 55c, 65c and 80c or whatever? In Queensland it is down to 59c at the moment. When they want to increase their market share they are prepared to knock the price down and they raise it when they want to. I do not know about those opposite, but I do not trust the oil companies to do the right thing in terms of the 19c. That is the first point.

For better or for worse, that is the way things are at the moment. The fact is that there are a lot of single parent families, marriage breakdowns, divorces, and that sort of thing.

What happens to these children, some as young as 13 or 14?  Not long ago I attended the official opening by the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, at a place on the Gold Coast called MacLaughlin House, which is a sort of halfway house. There was a lovely young lass there who looked about 15 or 16. I said to the social workers, `How come she is here?'. They said, `We found her huddled up in a phone box last night because she had been forced to leave home'. So I went up to her and said, `Why did you leave home?'. I will not say here why she did, but the reason certainly was not very nice. She was forced to leave home as she was scared of her stepfather. The point is that these are the sorts of things that go on. Whether or not we close our eyes to these things, they are happening out in the community, even on the Gold Coast, which is supposed to be one of the richest places in Australia.

         In the Department of Social Security we are trialing across the country youth pilot projects where we have social workers and people that are experienced in working with youth going out in the community to talk to the kids, to stop them, if possible, from getting into such things as crime, prostitution and all this sort of thing simply to survive, and to let them know that under certain circumstances they are entitled to some help from the Government. We do this in a number of areas. I hope that in due course, after the pilot projects are finished, we may be in a position to expand them as a permanent feature of the Department.

         One of the reasons these projects are working so well is that we have 400-odd social workers working in our Department. Under the Fightback proposals, those opposite would privatise the positions of social workers. They would privatise them out. I want to tell the House the sort of work that social workers do. It is relevant to the Bills that are before the House in the sense that the social workers are there to help people access some of the payments made by the Department of Social Security.

        It reminds me—and I know the honourable member for Fairfax, who is sitting at the table, will remember this—of the 1990 Charleville floods. I think that happened around May 1990. I had only recently been appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department, so I thought, `Well, we've got to go out there and do something for these people'. They were really down and out. They were in a tent city. There were helicopters flying around the place. It was unbelievable. I thought I was watching

         I went out there immediately on one of those Hercules aircraft with the area manager and a lady by the name of Desley Hargreaves, who was the chief social worker. She and I, with Mr Whitelaw—I think he was a deputy manager—took a little portable computer to the area and set up a shopfront. This chief social worker for the area central office, or whatever it was at the time, spoke to the people themselves and said, `How can we help you?'. We provided them with income support because they were desperate.

         My time has almost finished. I have not said too much about these Bills, but there is not that much to say about them, apart from the fact that they are really good initiatives. I want to place on record the fantastic work that is done by the social workers in the Department of Social Security, who are many times forgotten in the whole context of things. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that under this Government social workers will still be there to assist those people that need help. We are not about to throw them out and privatise them. If somebody came up to the counter in a situation of distress and asked for some help, under the Opposition's proposals we would have to say to them, `You'd better go out because you'll have to go and see them. They're up at some accountant's office because they've been privatised'. I commend these Bills to the House.

         —I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) because, unlike him, I intend to spend some time talking about the Social Security Amendment Bill. What is quite obvious from the Bill and from the discussions and interjections of Government members is that what we have now is a little more of the `big bribe' technique which is so favoured by the Government in these times of very real hardship. But in reality it is only a little bribe because it is providing access to funds from next January—that ties in well with an election in February or March—so that people can request a lump sum advance of half their six-month allowance at the first child rate of up to $135.

         Of course, what is significant about that is that it is people's own money. It is not as though the Government is giving them anything; it is their own money and they have an option of one advance every six months. I suppose the concept of lump sum advances is more or less all right in order to help low income people meet unexpected one-off payments. But people have to realise that having received that, their allowance is reduced by half for the next six months. I believe we need to draw the line. The family allowance is designed to supplement wages in order to meet family needs.

         The reality is that the Government passed a Bill in May which enabled family allowance payments to be paid on alternative weeks to payments of pensions or benefits. It was claimed—and I certainly support it—that this would ensure that poorer families with children had access to four cash payments each month. The impact of this legislation is that by assisting people with a lump sum it will actually reduce the number of payments that people receive on an ongoing basis. We supported this earlier proposal as it provided a better cash flow and assisted people who may have had difficulty in budgeting for household expenditure over a two-week period. I point out that while many families on welfare do face one-off debts—for example, health costs—we would not support any further extension allowing access to larger sums.

         Family allowance was intended as a supplement to wages policy because wages do not take account of family responsibilities. Family allowance was not intended as a series of lump sum payments. It must not be turned into a series of lump sum payments—in other words, buy-offs of people. Obviously, the Government's intention is to make it look better than it actually is. It is quite obvious that the Government has no new ideas on how to improve Australia's standard of living so it has come up with some very crafty imagery. It is selling something old as something new. As I have said, people will get their own money in advance.

         We should all remember the One Nation family bonus payment. It went down well at the time, but it has not left Australian families any better off in the long run and it did not go very far. I think we should face up to the problems which are facing Australian families, and this Bill is about families. At a time of record unemployment, we have a disastrous situation. In May, 215,000 two-parent families had one or both parents unemployed. There were 225,000 single parent families where the parent had no job. That is a disastrous situation. There were 600,000 kids living in poverty—75,000 of them on the street.

People are scared of losing their jobs. It is appropriate, though unfortunate, that people are scared of losing their jobs—because a million of their fellow Australians have already lost their jobs, thanks to the Government. What we are providing is a fairer system. The family is the heart of Australia. Australian families have been left battered and bruised by the Labor Party; literally by Labor's neglect.

         This legislation, I am sure, will be carried because the Government has the numbers—it has the numbers for the time being, but not for long—and I imagine the Australian Democrats will help the Government get it through into law. I want to point out the difference between what families will get with this law in place under Labor and what they will get under Fightback, under a coalition government. If their earnings are under $30,000, with Labor's proposal they could get $135.85 maximum every six months. Under the coalition's Fightback plan they could get $271.70.

         This Bill will amend the taxation law to implement personal tax cuts from 1994-95, and for subsequent income years, as outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation statement of 26 February 1992. This gives effect to the Government's commitment to deliver on these tax reductions without resort to the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. It adds to this Government's unparalleled record in introducing progressive reform of the taxation system and confirms Australia's position under this Government as a fair and low tax country. In 1990, taking account of all levels of government, Australia had the third lowest tax burden in the OECD. Only the United States and Turkey have a lower burden of taxation.

         The reductions in the tax rates will be implemented in two stages from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. New scales of personal tax rates for incomes within the range $20,700 to $50,000 will operate from 1 July 1994. Further reductions in those rates will apply from 1 January 1996. The Bill contains the rate scales to apply for 1994-95, 1996-97 and subsequent income years. As the second reduction in personal tax rates has effect from 1 January 1996, the Bill also contains a composite rate scale for the 1995-96 income year. That scale is obtained from an average of the tax rates to apply from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996 respectively.

After two years, the new 30 per cent rate will apply to the income range $20,700 to $40,000, some $4,000 wider than the current range.

         The current 46 per cent rate for the income range $36,000 to $50,000 will be reduced to 40 per cent over the same period with a corresponding reduction of $4,000 in the income range to a range of $40,000 to $50,000. This means that for someone earning $28,000 a year, for example, the tax cuts will increase disposable income by about $11 a week. The tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 July 1994. For the forward estimate years, the cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $3.2 billion in 1994-95 and $5.2 billion in 1995-96. The measures I am introducing today are an integral part of the Government's tax reform agenda as detailed in the statement on tax policy which I propose to table today.

         In the Budget, the Government indicated its desire to reduce the deficit in 1995-96 to between half and one per cent of GDP after allowing for the cuts to personal income tax. It is possible this outcome could be achieved without resort to any additional revenue measures. The Government did, however, identify three possible measures which could be considered, if necessary, to yield in excess of $2 billion.

         In the statement on tax policy the Government outlines measures which will have the net effect of reducing the deficit by $2 billion in 1995-96. But in order to put this issue beyond doubt, the Government has gone further and by advancing the date of implementation of those measures the deficit will be reduced by $4.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. In this way the Government will pursue sensible tax reform based on fairness and efficiency but will also bolster the stance of fiscal policy. The consequence of this action is that the Government is confident that the deficit reduction program implicit in the Budget will be exceeded during the course of the forward estimate years.

         Since 1983, the Government has radically transformed the taxation system into a more effective, more efficient and fairer system. In the 1990s, the Government will maintain the effectiveness of the existing tax system to meet new challenges and to fund the vital activities of government in providing for the security and development of our nation and the well-being of the people. The Government's taxation policies have consistently produced more equitable sharing of the tax burden and lower marginal tax rates. These policies have been pursued both through changes to the design of the income tax and through the continuous improvement of tax administration and compliance.

         In 1985, we considered and rejected the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax and opted instead to make taxes on the income base more efficient and equitable. In particular, we introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which are directed at previously untaxed income received by predominantly high income individuals. Other reforms have been introduced progressively to increase the effectiveness of tax administration and to improve tax compliance. This program has included the introduction of self-assessment of income tax—supported by substantially upgraded audit programs—the introduction of the tax file number system and other information reporting, modernisation of tax compliance through a major new computer acquisition program matched with organisational changes in the Tax Office and the reorientation of the Tax Office towards a revision of information and advisory services to taxpayers to assist them in meeting their tax obligations.

         The Government's policy approach has resulted in a broader income base and reduced tax evasion and reduced tax avoidance.

         Since 1983, the Government has introduced a range of measures particularly to assist low income earners. For example, cuts to personal income tax rates in January 1991 raised the threshold at which tax is payable from $5,100 to $5,400 and reduced the bottom marginal tax rate from 21c to 20c in the dollar. At the same time, the income level up to which the bottom rate applies was extended from $17,650 to $20,700. By contrast, when this Government took office in 1983, the tax free threshold was set just below $5,000 and the bottom marginal rate of 30c in the dollar applied to incomes up to $19,500, and above that level the rate was 46c in the dollar.

         This Government introduced the family allowance supplement, which provides substantial support for low income families. In the One Nation statement, the Government provided further assistance for low income families by way of increases in FAS of $3 a week per child from the first payday in April 1992. FAS boosts the disposable income of eligible families by up to $60.80 a fortnight for each child aged up to 13 years and to $85.90 for each child aged between 13 to 15 years.

         The introduction of the fringe benefits tax significantly improved the equity of the tax system because it provided a means of ensuring that income provided in kind was taxed. The FBT was designed with a variety of administrative considerations in mind. The Government believes that it is now appropriate to improve the effectiveness of the FBT, and considerably enhance the fairness of the tax system, by changing the method of calculating the value base of the tax by making it as near to that of income tax as possible.

         Other legislation I am introducing today provides that, from April 1994, the fringe benefits tax will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefit and FBT payments will be deductible to the employer for income tax purposes. This is equivalent to the tax treatment of salary, where the employee pays income tax on the gross amount of salary and the employer has a tax deduction equal to the gross amount of that salary. The change to the valuation of the FBT base will raise about $2.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96.

         The Government is not considering any other changes to the FBT. In particular, we do not propose to alter the classes of FBT exempt organisations, so that religious institutions and public benevolent institutions will continue to be exempt. Special arrangements will be provided, however, for non-government organisations that are non-taxpaying bodies which are subject to FBT at the moment. The Government does intend changing the various special rules that apply to such benefits as education of children of Australians employed overseas and foreign residents employed in Australia.

         The Government is going to introduce a goods and services tax, says the Deputy Leader without any basis for the claim. This only indicates how weak he is in not being able to defend the principal plank of his Fightback proposal. We have introduced legislation to pay a 30 per cent tax rate without a consumption tax. So the people of Australia should know that the tax rates legislated for today in this Parliament are all that they could expect from the coalition but with a consumption tax. The fact is that there is no need for a consumption tax to be introduced to pay for tax cuts because, as I demonstrated yesterday, $26 billion of the $27 billion is given back in other taxes: that is, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, $9 billion; the abolition of the payroll tax, $6 billion; the abolition of the petrol excise, $7 billion; and the compensation package for those hurt by the GST, $4 billion. One billion dollars will fund $13 billion worth of tax cuts. So the fact is that obviously the GST was not necessary to reduce the marginal rates of tax to 30 per cent at two-thirds of average weekly earnings.

         As the Government itself has demonstrated, we did not need a consumption tax and do not need a consumption tax to pay lower rates of tax for those three-quarters of Australians whose last dollar of income will be within that marginal rate of 30 per cent. We have been able to give three-quarters of Australians a 30 per cent tax rate on their last dollar of income, without a consumption tax. So all the rest of the nasties—15 per cent on food, 15 per cent on clothing and 15 per cent on services to provide these tax cuts—were totally unnecessary. All we are going to do is basically have a huge tax shuffle which will see the WST, payroll tax and petrol excise abolished at massive disruption to the economy—with six to eight percentage points additional inflation, six to eight percentage points additional in interest rates—pushing the economy into a recession, along with the destruction of Medicare, along with a confrontationist industrial relations policy.

         —I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. Members of the House will be aware that under Medicare the Government has succeeded in giving all Australians access to health care services—access to affordable Medicare—with over 70 per cent of medical services being provided at no cost to the patient. This has been achieved without a blow-out in the costs of hospital services, and total health spending has been maintained at around 8 per cent of GDP. This could have been achieved only with the Federal Government playing an important role in determining Medicare rebates, hospital funding and access to health services. As a result under Medicare 70 per cent of all GP services involve no out of pocket costs for the patient. More than three-quarters of all medical services are delivered at or below the medical benefits schedule and only 3 per cent of services are billed at or above the AMA schedule.

         Against that, we have an Opposition which is determined one way or another to privatise the health system in Australia. It is determined one way or another to shift the responsibility from all Australians on to families. It would introduce policies that would result in subsidies to private insurance of about $2.5 billion at the expense of the public hospital system.

         We have seen just in the last few days the link between privatisation at the national level and what we see being pursued by the State coalition in New South Wales. Clearly what it has signalled this week is its intention to dismantle the public hospital system as an essential part of that agenda. We already know that it sees Port Macquarie as a launching pad for a wider scheme of privatisation of health. Major teaching hospitals such as Prince Henry and the Prince of Wales are also on the privatisation list, threatening the essential teaching functions of those hospitals. We already know also that the cost per bed, which is projected at Port Macquarie at $650, is far in excess of the average cost of $400 across Australia. Indeed, those hospital beds would be the most expensive beds anywhere in Australia. Of course, that will in turn lead not only to a blow-out in hospital costs but also to a shifting of those costs from the State to the Commonwealth.

         When questioned on Radio 2BL yesterday, the New South Wales Health Minister admitted as much. He said, `There will be some cost shift for the Federal Government in terms of picking it up as well'. What Mr Phillips was saying is that the only way New South Wales can finance the profits of private operators running expensive private hospitals is by making sure that the Federal Government bears much of the cost. These points are important because the coalition is presenting a dangerous cocktail of privatisation, backed up by private insurance—exactly the same cocktail that has the United States health care system in crisis.

         In the area of health, we have the clearest possible division between the policies of the Government and those of the coalition. Our policies are stable, have maintained costs, have guaranteed quality health care and have ensured security for older people. Against that the policies of the coalition, linked at the State and Commonwealth level, would produce insecurity, shift costs onto families, and result in a massive blow-out of costs, leading to instability and a threat to the nation's health system right across this country.

         I asked the Taxation Commissioner to look at the issue of compliance and enforcement to see whether we could extend the general proposition of compliance to about 95 per cent, which would be a very high standard in anyone's terms. The Commissioner has identified areas where he thinks compliance is below 95 per cent and indicated some areas and some measures which could be adopted in order to assist in that regard.

         The point is that of course it is difficult to completely quantify what the size of the black economy is, but what we can do is identify areas where compliance is low—and that is what the Tax Commissioner has done—and devise mechanisms by which we can improve compliance by improving such things as information reporting through the tax file number system and the operation of auditing, and by encouraging small business to improve its record keeping and the like. They are the things which the Commissioner has referred to in his report—

         If that were his attitude it would be a throw back to the period prior to 1983 when those opposite let the tax system run riot. Whether or not you paid tax was a matter of choice for most taxpayers because those opposite did not care and they would not do anything about it when the Tax Commissioner asked them to.

        It's not satisfactory because the NFF has been a long time supporter of a goods and services tax.

Now at the moment we can't be completely accurate until the coalition tells us the level of the road user charge.

       <para>
        The road user charge is between $3 1/2 and $4 billion. The registration fee could be as high as $17,000 on a six-axle truck or $35,000 on a very large truck. The first sign of grapeshot we saw was in the press statement from the shadow Minister which said that the Opposition does not have to introduce a charge. What we are seeing is the first unravelling of Dr Hewson, the first unravelling of the brave new world. It is just like the unravelling we saw this morning—that the Government will have a consumption tax, too; it is just like what the Opposition has said about tariffs: `We are just the same as the Government'.

The whole Fightback policy, the brave new order, stands about two shots across the trench. They have the tin hats on and they are ducking for cover and, worse than that, they are putting our tin hats on to disguise themselves. `We are just like them', they keep saying.

         —It would be a bad Question Time, Mr Acting Speaker, if we could not express an opinion. I can assure the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that the Government is not considering any cuts to Austrade or any export facilitating measure—not to the export market development grants scheme, the international trade enhancement scheme, the innovative agricultural marketing program or to export access. We are not going to slash the public sector in any of these areas.

         As a matter of fact, in the Budget we introduced four new measures to facilitate trade. We extended the export market development grants scheme to eight years for new markets—unlike the Opposition, we do not attack that scheme at every opportunity. In terms of the export working capital facility that is to apply to EFIC, that will help our exporters in respect of finance. With respect to the aid agency, we have established a private sector linkages program; and in the portfolios of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce we have initiated a clean food export strategy. Unlike the Opposition, we have a multifaceted trade strategy. We do not get obsessed with single prongs, as does the honourable member for Kooyong.

          The allocation for Austrade in this year's Budget was $119.4m. That was an increase from $110.2m last year. There have been a lot of misinformed comments about Austrade. Austrade, in its post-McKinsey inquiry guise, has become a lot more rigorous. It has reorganised itself and it will be spending something like 63 per cent of its resources offshore this year. Next year, that will go up to 70 per cent.

         document to cut $70m out of Austrade over two years and that would effectively halve its operating budget. The Opposition never stops attacking Austrade. The honourable member for Mayo will be delighted if I give him another run. On 26 March this year, in one of his usual expressive and outrageous press releases, he said that Austrade had a massive budget of $130m and that what had taken place in Austrade was absolutely scandalous. He said it was rort-ridden and that I have to rein the body in. He stated, `Once again, the Opposition's policy to change Austrade substantially has been vindicated'. All members of this House know how the honourable member for Mayo rabbits on.

Is it a bit more of the shambles that we are seeing here? Is this too going to be added to the fiddles? Is this too going to be added to all the holes? Is this too going to be added to all the implicit dishonesty in that document? Has the honourable member for Kooyong been told he might get a bit more money for Austrade if he ever gets into government? Has the honourable member for Flinders been told that he might have to add a bit more to his GST if he ever gets into government? God help trade if he ever does.

I will very quickly respond to the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that whenever we are under a bit of pressure we have the same policy as the Government, and that this is an explanation for the fact that I have been alleging that Labor would introduce a GST after the next election. He is plain wrong to say that on that issue, on the basis of our claim, there is no difference between the parties. There is a very clear difference between the parties: we will say honestly what we are going to do and these people will lie and cheat to the next election to save their own political skins.

         If people find it a bit incredible—as did one journalist interviewing me this morning—that we should allege that Labor would introduce a goods and services tax after the next election, they should not forget the Government's record. These are the people who said, `There will be no capital gains tax' and then introduced a capital gains tax. These are the people who supported and took political benefit out of advertisements in the last campaign which said that Labor would never privatise the Commonwealth Bank, and proceeded to do exactly that.

A lot of questions remain unanswered, but the most important question is the one that the Treasurer dodged in Question Time, `How can you possibly justify a major reform of the tax system and provide for 47 per cent of all Australian taxpayers no income tax relief whatsoever? How can you have the gall to stand here and claim compassion for lower income Australians when in fact you totally reject them?'. The Government put them into the recession.

There, exposed for all to see, was the politics of the tax games that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have been up to—the Prime Minister with his poisoned pen rewriting the Budget for political purposes, designed to deceive the Australian public between now and the next election. It was exposed by Laura Tingle in the

There was a 36-hour panic in the Australian Taxation Office, in the Treasurer's office and the Prime Minister's office to cobble together a few proposals and a few claims that somehow a new tax initiative would be produced to try to plug an enormous hole in the Government's budgetary projections, an enormous hole brought about by an earlier political decision—again not a decision based on an analysis of what should be done to help the country, but a decision designed solely to respond to the Fightback program, and nothing else.

It still leaves a hole, according to the Government's own figures—and we can believe them if we want—of about $4 1/2 billion in 1995-96 in the Budget deficit or, if we take it on a cumulative basis over five years, the Government is left with something like a $50 billion hole in its cumulative deficit up until 1996.

I will go to the capital gains tax, because I think it is terribly important. I will talk about one or two other secret taxes on the part of the Opposition. It is true that in the 1983 election campaign Mr Hawke went to the public and said, `We will not introduce a capital gains tax'. Then in 1984 there was another election. In the course of that election campaign, Mr Hawke was asked the specific question, `Will you introduce a capital gains tax?', and he said, `I will give you no undertaking on that in this election; I will give you none. We are going to have a tax summit. We are going to consider the introduction of a range of measures, and among them will be a capital gains tax'.

         Opposition members forget the little inconvenience of the initial election in 1983 and the subsequent introduction of a capital gains tax. Mr Hawke made it absolutely clear to the Australian electorate in 1984 that he would indeed contemplate a capital gains tax and took whatever political damage there was to take on that issue when it was subsequently demonised by members of the Opposition. They have taken a long time to come around to the view that people who get their earnings in capitalist gains, as opposed to simply getting their earnings through being PAYE taxpayers, ought to be equally treated. It has been a very long time before they have been able to get round to accepting that. They have been cheerful enough about demonising us in the electorate on capital gains tax in that intervening period. But there ain't no evidence in that example either!

In the final analysis, whatever difficulty 15 per cent causes small business, it is nothing compared with what it will cause the ordinary people in this country as they are economically destroyed by a piece of pure political lunacy—imposing a 15 per cent consumption tax on an economy in recovery, imposing a tax that increases the inflation rate and imposing a tax that will create industrial trouble.

         —Two weeks ago, President Bush announced a dramatic increase in the export enhancement program subsidies on US farm products—an increase from $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion for the next year. For wheat, that meant an increase from $US900m in the year just ending to a minimum of $US1.4 billion this year. That announcement sent shock waves through the wheat industry in Australia and through anybody in Australia who has a concern about our trade balance. Wheat growers remembered those terrible wheat war years of 1986 and 1990.

         The announcement by President Bush indicated that there was a new system of EEP: that all of the export wheat from the United States was available for EEP markets and it listed the tonnages and the countries. Those countries included two new ones—Pakistan and South Africa—which have been traditional markets for Australian wheat, and once again included India, which is now a market for Australian wheat. It indicated also that more money was available if necessary.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For Australia and Australian wheat growers, that immediately meant that the price of wheat would drop. The simple fact of that announcement meant that the wheat market weakened immediately. It also meant that the market share for Australia's wheat internationally was being further and further restricted because the United States had indicated the tonnages available to Australian wheat exports for the future—or those tonnages available without competition with the United States and its subsidised exports. It means that, from a country that was producing 15 million tonnes of wheat for export, Australia is being forced back to producing only 10 million tonnes of wheat for export, with all that that means for wheat growers' incomes and Australia's balance of payments.

Instead of the first information about this announcement coming through to Australia and the Australian Government from the White House to our embassy in Washington, as it should have done, or from the US embassy here to this Government, it came from a private tip-off.

         The announcement indicated that the US considered that it was under no pressure whatsoever from this Australian Government. It highlighted the complete failure of this Government and its wheat policy. It also highlighted the correctness of the coalition Opposition to be stronger in relation to the need to maintain pressure on the United States, to seek access for Australian products to the United States and other restricted markets, and to have a stronger bilateral presence in seeking alternative markets.

         The announcement also revealed the extent of the US trade war against Australia. What was the response of the Government to President Bush's announcement? It basically bought the United States line: `Don't react. Nothing may happen. No need to worry immediately. What we need is quiet diplomacy—softly, softly. Don't upset anybody'. The best—or worst—example of that softly, softly approach was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in Washington two months before. On the advice given to me, he went so softly, softly that the matter was not even raised in the United States. Certainly in the areas of fruit and dairy products, there was no representation at all.

         What about the reaction of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? It took him six days after the first announcement of President Bush's new policy initiative with EEP to formally reply. Compare that to the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who immediately wrote a letter to the President. The charge d'affaires was not called in while the US Ambassador was absent. There is no evidence that the US Ambassador has been called in here. There is no evidence of any official protest in the United States. All this Government did was bring on a matter of public importance debate in this House about a week ago, still trying to justify its failed softly, softly approach. For a day or two it even conned some of the media and a few people in the industry.

         What has happened? The Pakistan wheat sale. No-one should be surprised that that sale has occurred, because the new system that has been put in place for EEP is the opposite of the line that this Government has been pushing. It has opened up the whole EEP market, the whole export tonnage of the United States, to grain traders from day one. Those grain traders have not been slow to get into action.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There still has been no significant response from the Australian Government. There was no decent intelligence that told the Australian Government that this Pakistan sale was about to occur. If anybody wants any confirmation of the feelings the United States has about this Government and its lack of reaction, it is that at the very time that that announcement of the wheat sale to Pakistan is made, and also of the second and third sales of canned fruit to Japan under the same program, the chief EEP operator for the United States is in this country and will be in this Parliament House in about an hour's time. So much for the sensitivity of the United States to what has to be done with regard to this Government on this issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The next thing, and I think the most significant thing, is that the Pakistan sale delivers all the worst signals possible for the Australian wheat industry. Firstly, it is a new market that has not been in EEP before. It is a traditional commercial market for Australia; it has always been a commercial market in the past. There is no European Community wheat of that type going to Pakistan. It is a white wheat market. The US claims that it has heard some rumours that something may be happening, but it is well known that the EC does not have that type of wheat. It is an unnecessarily large subsidy. That subsidy has effectively reduced the world price for wheat by 20 to 25 per cent, with all the implications that means for our wheat growers. Remember, at this stage the United States has its lowest wheat stocks on record and does not have an over-large harvest.

What about Egypt, also out there bidding at present, which is one of our markets too? Let us see what the Government is doing. In this morning's

         Along with the European Community, the United States is the main sinner with regard to domestic production subsidies for a whole range of agricultural products and export subsidies that are necessary to flog the stuff overseas. The third point concerns restrictions to access for our products—those same products—to its market. Japan has as many or more domestic production subsidies and restrictions to access for our agricultural products.

         The United States actually has a whole range of domestic agricultural policies which are similar to those of the European Community. In recent months our farmers and exporters have seen the fury of US export subsidies, with canned fruit being included in that export program for the first time. Now the third sale has taken place to Japan at a time when the United States is already increasing its market share in that market, a market in which canned fruit and a range of horticultural products attract not only EEP assistance but also another subsidy program called the MPP.

         The US also has a dairy export program. So far this calendar year it has built that up to $70m. It has taken market away from us in Saudi Arabia, while at the same time Australia is virtually denied access to the United States market for our dairy products. We have a small quota on cheese, and every other product is basically excluded. It even had a dumping measure against canned pears brought in in 1972, and it has never been removed because there is no opportunity under its laws for industry to have it removed and because of lack of pressure from this Government to do anything about it.

         Let us look at the restrictions the US placed on Australia's access to the beef and meat market half way through this year and the havoc that has created in our industry. Perhaps the worst example of the lot is sugar. The US is gradually restricting access year by year, down from 800,000 tonnes to 96,000 tonnes. The Government took it to the GATT a couple of years ago and won the case. Nothing has happened in the United States since then, and this Government has not maintained pressure on it to do anything. That says a lot for how sensible and useful taking the wheat problem to the GATT will be. Only three weeks ago the US further restricted our sugar access. All the Government could do was bring in the Mexican furphy on sugar, put up by its own front organisation, the Evatt Foundation. Even the Minister, when he found out the facts, had to admit that Mexico is an importer of sugar.

         —The last two weeks have convinced me of absolutely one thing: heaven help Australia if the Opposition were ever to get into government and put into place all the contradictory, naive, stupid things those opposite have been saying on trade and exports. Their trade policy is a combination of hiss, wind and back to traditional Country Party abuse. I suppose the poor old Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), thought he had to come in here and say these things. I thought he was quite right on the analysis of the US position when he said, `We have to do something. There is a lack of pressure and we have to take these things up'.

         That is what we come up against every time we seriously debate this whole question. World trade is distorted. It was the United States that kept agriculture out of the GATT, with the GATT waiver exercised in 1954. It is Australia and the present US Administration that have forced agriculture into the GATT Round.

         A lot of this started when the US packaged its EEP in one year, in an election context, rather than announcing initiative after initiative. A lot of this debate is taking place because the National Party is mightily embarrassed, with the Queensland State election coming up, about zero tariffs for sugar.

         We are quite happy to take on this question of Australia's trade promotion and protection. The Opposition, quite frankly, still has not been able to divine what has changed in the world; what international forces are now at work; and what the US policies and strategies have been and now are. It has not been able to work out what the EC's policies and strategies are and may be, and what the realities of the interests of trading areas are. From all of this it does not understand what Australia's interests and strategies should be at this time. There is a harking back to the past and, as I said, more of the old Country Party approach of abusing people.

         Calling the United States our No. 1 trade enemy is okay for a National Party conference, but those opposite really cannot do that if the next day they say that they want to join an unspecified North American Free Trade Arrangement; the next day they admit that they do not know how they would do it; or claim that a naive letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has somehow immediately changed Republican Party trade policy, as if the Opposition can write campaign speeches. It is totally hypocritical for the Opposition to raise this matter of public importance after it has fundamentally done so much damage to our relations with our major trading partners and allies by saying, `US—No. 1 enemy', by making false claims about President Bush's reasons for action and by sending off a rude letter. If that works then those opposite should write a letter every day. Maybe they should have written another letter today. The US announced an EEP yesterday on wheat to Pakistan and there is another one today. I think those opposite ought to write a letter a day if they think that is going to work.

         With respect to Japan, the matter today is really aimed at protecting the decaying National Party in Queensland. But in the process all the Opposition did was to offend our biggest trading partner with whom we have a $6 billion surplus. A $6 billion surplus does not mean that we ease up. I just spent a week in Japan, even to the extent of talking to LDP members on the island of Kyushu about rice, about coal and about our products. The pressure from Australia never stops.

         It is absurd to talk about rice with Japan in a bilateral context. Only the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can control the US congressional system, US politics and, at the same time, the Japanese political system. Even if the LDP were able to get arrangements to purchase rice bilaterally from Australia through its lower House, its upper House could not resist the temptation to block it. It is nonsense to think we can do anything about rice, in the bilateral context, with Japan. As I pointed out the other day, with a $45 billion trade deficit and with the United States providing the defence umbrella and massive leverage, the United States can do nothing bilaterally on rice. But the Leader of the Opposition, who has just discovered this issue and all the restrictions that apply from Japan, somehow thinks that, if he talks about it and makes us feel warm inside, it will solve the problem.

Of course, the Leader of the National Party is going to cross that bridge when he comes to it. It is also absurd that the Opposition raises this issue when it has no policy in this area and when our trade performance is a success story that all Australians can share in and be proud of. My colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) will outline this success to the House when he speaks on this matter of public importance.

         The Deputy Leader of the National Party spoke mainly about the United States, EEP and wheat and did not address the matter of public importance as such. Everything that the Republican Administration has said through the Reagan years and now under President Bush in principle has been about trade liberalisation. The US practice and tactics in a distorted trade world are at odds with the US Administration's stated principles. Perhaps we can understand what was in President Bush's Detroit speech if we accept that fundamental fact.

         For the Opposition to talk about trade blocs, about Australia being left out if we do not join the North American Free Trade Arrangement, the EC, or the Arctic Circle trade agreement is ignorant, malicious scaremongering and nothing else. The Government's position on the recent EEP announcements is well known. I will be stressing our disagreement with the US analysis of the Pakistan market when I am there next week, especially regarding the level of subsidy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and I talked with the US Ambassador last night, we were briefed by Stephen Censky, and there is simply no way that we did not hammer those points forward.

If those opposite were allowed to act as a government the way they act as an Opposition, the Americans would not be coming here for talks on trade the way they are; they would be hurting our farmers and our steel makers even more.

There is not a sensible, informed commentator in this country who has agreed with a word of what the Opposition has been saying on trade policy over the last two weeks. Today, in a question at Question Time, I picked up the point again in Fightback that the Opposition is going to slash Austrade; it is going to slash aid—and aid is commercially directed in part these days, and that is very important; and it is going to go for zero tariffs and wreck the car industry.

         The Opposition then said that we should join the North American Free Trade Agreement. Again, not one responsible trade commentator anywhere has supported the Opposition in this. NAFTA, from what we do know about it, is about concessions. It is not really a free trade zone like the EC, but a series of separate bilateral relationships between each of the three, especially with respect to agriculture. So what have we got to offer? The US has access to our markets now. How can the Opposition negotiate and how can it bargain if it has got a policy of zero tariffs? It has nothing to bargain with unless agriculture is in it. The way the Opposition is carrying on is simply nonsensical.

         NAFTA looks more and more as if the United States is going to act as a hub and take countries one at a time. Why do honourable members think that in his speech in Detroit President Bush is saying that he wants to get central Europe into some free trade arrangement—the same countries that applied to join the EC? What is he saying about the Pacific? That is directed towards Japan, just as talking about central Europe is directed towards Europe; it is putting pressure on in the multilateral context. There are all kinds of strategies and tactics implicit in those statements of President Bush's vision for his next term if he is elected. NAFTA has nothing for Australia compared with the Asia-Pacific trading area; it has nothing for us compared with regional trade liberalisation, bilateral trade liberalisation, all hopefully under the umbrella of multilateral trade liberalisation.

         Why multilateral? The real world of trade today is non-tariff barriers; it is some of the barriers that the honourable member for Murray pointed to in Japan. If one gets those, in the terms of the jargon, `comprehensively tariffed'—all measures of protection and restriction expressed as a tariff—and one gets a multilateral solution, then in one fell swoop one will wipe out all those thousands of non-tariff barriers. If one gets a multilateral solution in the Uruguay Round, and if one looks at the Dunkel text and takes into account the access arrangements, Australia gets access to markets of all the GATT contracting parties—some 103 to 108 countries—and again we can prosecute bilateral trade far more easily.

         Let us look at the history. Quite apart from the fact that agriculture has never been in multilateral trade negotiations before, at other times we always found we had very little to offer, and we had nothing to buy any concessions with. When Doug Anthony went to the last round of trade negotiations he came back saying that he did not have to cut a single tariff in Australia. That is because of the situation where we had the strong orientation of all our exports to agriculture and natural resource based products, world markets where commodity prices fluctuate, and we really had nothing to bargain with unless agriculture was in the round. So that is why this Government formed the Cairns Group; that is why this Government formed APEC. The idea behind APEC was to get regional trade liberalisation, and to have a forum where economic and trade matters could be discussed.

         There is no lack of pressure on any front with respect to our trade approach. Now there is the invitation for the Prime Minister to raise these matters in Japan. Of course he will; he always does. The honourable member for Kooyong says that we have only got a single pronged trade strategy—some would say that the honourable member for Kooyong has a single pronged approach to many things in politics—but I do not share those views. Let me quickly identify the prongs—if that is the word—of our trade policy. Multilaterally it is via the Cairns Group; regionally, it is APEC, and there are sub-regional approaches; bilaterally it is country to country—whether it is Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Kuwait or New Zealand. Of course there are sectoral trade policies, and we are prosecuting these multifaceted approaches in all of those areas.

         Let us look at Austrade, the main facilitating body with respect to bilateral trade. This is the organisation that members of the Opposition are virtually going to wipe out, although I understand that now their Leader is having second thoughts about that. We have the national trade strategy between the Australian Government and the State and Territory governments, and the results are there, as my colleague will explain. I thank members of the Opposition for this matter of public importance. I thank them for the whole debacle they have brought upon themselves by raising the issue of trade policy.

         We are not here inventing easy solutions. There is reel after reel of illustrations of how we as a nation have marked time in trade performance. We are not here in opposition suggesting that there is a simple way round. But we are saying that in the light of what has happened, particularly in the last two weeks: why are we not protesting loudly to the Americans and demanding some sort of bilateral trade negotiations so that we can get additional access to the American market to compensate us for what the Americans are doing to us in what have been our traditional markets, contrary to the pledge given by their President in this chamber on 2 January of this year?

         Where did we go in this debate? We finished up with the Minister not dealing specifically with the agricultural trade question but instead dragging in the red herring of tariffs and suggesting that all that motivated us was the Queensland election. I have never heard such a blatantly two-faced approach from the Minister. If we wanted to be pragmatists, would we be backing the Government on its tariff line with sugar in Queensland right now? Of course we would not. Far from taking a cheap shot to win the Queensland election, we have taken the responsible view that effectively we have to maintain our present tariff regime.

         But we challenge the Government and say to it, `What are you doing for Australian wheat growers?'. The answer, sadly, is nothing. The obligation that the Minister has, representing Australian wheat growers, is to be in America now negotiating a new bilateral deal on behalf of not only wheat growers but also beef growers, horticultural producers and sugar growers in order to get some compensation for Australia's primary producers.

         I am sorry to break it to both gentlemen, and particularly to those in the National Party of Australia, but the fact is that Australia's trade has now moved on from simply primary products to other areas. Primary products are important; there is no question about that. They are a vital part of Australia's trade performance and, as the Minister clearly pointed out, at every opportunity this Government has been pursuing, through appropriate forums, ways in which to improve that performance.

         As the Minister also demonstrated, the leading role that Australia has played in the Cairns Group—with the Uruguay Round being driven, particularly in agriculture, by Australia and the other participants of the Cairns Group—demonstrates this Government's bona fides and concern for these issues. Interestingly, if one looks at some of the statistics—the honourable member for Wakefield talked of some of those statistics supposedly put around by the shadow Minister for trade, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)—they show some very interesting real world scenarios and pictures of what is happening as far as Australia's trade is concerned.

         I will deal briefly with a couple of those statistics. As far as Australia's export performance is concerned, export revenues have actually reached record levels in the life of this Government, despite depressed commodity prices and subdued world economic activity. Export volumes rose by 12 per cent in 1990-91 and by over 9 per cent in 1991-92. Our export volume growth in 1991 was the fastest in the OECD and our manufactures export growth was the fastest in the OECD in both 1990 and 1991. Finally, our export volumes grew almost three times faster than world trade in 1990 and four times faster in 1991.

         How did that happen? Is it because the Government has not got a trade policy? Is it because we have turned our back on Australian producers and exporters, as was claimed by those on the other side in this debate? That is absolute rubbish. If one looks at where that performance has come from, the direction of our exports, our trade surplus and so on, one can see clearly that there has been a change in emphasis. The story is exciting.

They should be out there talking about Ford Australia securing its first export program for Japan with a $30m contract to supply Mazda with 280,000 cylinder blocks as part of a wider program of parts replacement. They should be out there talking about the fact that our growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures almost doubled between 1986-87 and 1991-92 from something like $4.97 billion to $9.66 billion. Are those the sorts of figures of a government, a manufacturing sector and an export oriented economy—which Australia is—that demonstrate that there is no policy and that we are going backwards? I hardly think so.

         Of course, when we look at those aspects of our improved trade performance, we also have to give consideration to, quite simply, where some additional growth will come. That, of course, is in the services sector. Two weeks ago I, along with the Minister, was in Japan promoting Australia's trade—I in services and he particularly in agriculture and other matters. The interesting thing was that we were there also to open up the latest in one of Austrade's new offices in Japan to promote Australian trade. We went to another city called Sendai, where we will establish yet another Austrade office. We were talking to Japanese people about buying more Australian products.

         A matter of a week later, we had an unmitigated and unbelievable attack on Japan, our major trading partner, from the Opposition. Quite frankly, it is probably just as well that both the Minister and I had left Japan by then, because it would have been rather embarrassing to have to explain to people why we were establishing trade offices in their country, why we were there talking about how we were going to continue, particularly in the area of services, to promote trade from Australia, when at the same time they would be asking, `Why it is that there are people in your country, and a party that wants to be in government, that are attacking your main customer?'. As I said, fortunately we had left and we did not have to face those sorts of questions.

         Let me quickly deal with a couple of issues in the area of services. Education services from Australia are now worth $1 billion a year—that is, university, high school and a rapidly expanding market in vocational training. We talked to people in Japan about that. They said to us quite clearly, `Your education standards are superb. We would like to see more of our people go to Australia and train, particularly in postgraduate degrees, but importantly in English language training combined with secretarial skills'. I have taken that on board, and I will be talking to people in the TAFE systems at the State level and to people in DEET and other agencies in Australia to try to promote that in Japan.

         I followed that visit with one to Thailand. Exactly the same sorts of issues were raised with me. In fact, four of the outgoing Cabinet Ministers in Thailand were educated in Australia. They are out there working and promoting Australia for its educational opportunities—contributing to the $1 billion-plus per annum that Australia earns from education. Yet we have been told by the Opposition that all we should be concerned about is some statement that President Bush made on the stump in an election campaign about wheat. It smacks like the old days when the National Party was in government and it made announcements on the run in an election campaign. As far as this Government is concerned, we have diversified. We are internationalising our economy and our ability to trade.

         The other area where there are some benefits that can flow to Australia in our trade performance—away from the ETMs that I have mentioned, away from education and away from agriculture—is that of services such as financial services, insurance and health care. The interesting thing is that the statistics indicate that a Japanese, for example, could come to Australia, pay for an operation in this country and therefore contribute considerable sums of money to this area, holiday in this country to recuperate and again put money in almost as a tourist, and it would be cheaper than going to the United States. That is a market that again we can tap into, and something that we should be promoting. It is an untapped resource that at the moment is only on the periphery of our interests.

At the moment we are doing a study on South East Asia whereby we will actually have something of an outline, a road map, if you like, on strategies and how to get into those markets. We have talked about training opportunities, the need to get fluent in foreign languages, particularly in those areas to which we want to go, the importance of establishing an office in those locations to promote Australian trade, and the need to get into joint venture operations as well. All of this is part of the Government's trade strategy, because times have moved on. We have moved on from one-off deals. We have negotiated bilateral and multilateral trade deals.

Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature.

         A feature of the agreement with Vietnam is that it provides for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Vietnam under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from the development incentives to be nominated under the agreement, a tax credit will be allowed by Australia for the Vietnamese tax forgone under those incentive measures.

        I have great pleasure in introducing this Bill to the House. My particular pleasure derives from the fact that this Bill provides for further measures to assist frail older people in our community, and particularly their carers. It is appropriate that this Bill should be introduced today because this week has been designated Carers Week. This is a week when we are focusing particularly on the needs of people who care for family members, friends, neighbours or other members of the community.

         This Government's aged care policy pays particular attention to the needs of carers. The home and community care program lists carers as a special target group for the program. Our residential care program makes special provision for respite care to enable carers to have a break from time to time. This Budget proposes a package of assistance to carers amounting to $89m over four years.

         One of these measures concerns an increase to the domiciliary nursing care benefit, DNCB. This Bill contains provisions which, if passed, will enable implementation of that Budget announcement. The domiciliary nursing care benefit provides financial assistance to carers of people over the age of 16 who have been assessed as needing a nursing home level of care. Part 5 of this Bill includes amendments to support three changes to the DNCB to take effect from 6 January 1993.

         The first amendment will increase the level of the benefit by $10 to $52 per fortnight from 6 January 1993. The second amendment provides for the Minister to vary this amount from time to time. It is the Government's intention to index the benefit annually on the basis of CPI changes. The third amendment will allow carers to continue to receive the benefit during periods of respite care of up to 42 days a year.

         The significant increase of the benefit by approximately 25 per cent and its subsequent indexation demonstrates the Government's commitment to the recognition of and support for carers of frail older people and people with disabilities living in the community. The continued payment of the benefit while the person being cared for is in respite care will provide much needed support for carers and allow them to have short breaks from care without loss of benefit. This provision will bring the DNCB into line with provisions applying to similar payments in the social security area. Respite care is the service most highly valued by carers. The Bill also contains amendments concerning funding for new and rebuilt nursing homes.

         As a result of a decision in the 1991 Budget, the Government already provides additional recurrent funding for some nursing homes that are newly built or completely rebuilt. The aim of this initiative was to improve the quality of nursing home buildings, and hence to improve the quality of care. The nursing home industry took the view that this initiative would not efficiently meet its objective since a proprietor could apply for the additional funding only after building the new home. They said that a proprietor considering rebuilding his or her home needed an assurance of the additional funding before construction commenced; otherwise he or she would not be able to borrow the money to rebuild. The proposed amendment overcomes this problem, and introduces a system of approvals in principle.

         The recent Budget provided funding for approvals in principle for 1992-93 and 1993-94. However, it is possible that many proprietors who do not intend to rebuild their home in the near future will nevertheless apply for an approval in principle just in case they change their minds or in case the State health authorities force them to rebuild. There is therefore a risk that the available approvals in principle will be wasted. To avoid this possibility this legislative amendment allows the approval in principle to be revoked if no progress is made towards the rebuilding. The approvals in principle will then be able to be reallocated.

         The Bill makes provision for a change in date of effect of reviews of resident classifications. Under the current funding arrangements for nursing homes, the proprietor applies for a classification for a new resident or for a current resident whose classification is about to expire. This classification is based on the resident classification instrument, RCI, which measures a resident's need for nursing and personal care. These classifications are used to determine the amount of funding for nursing and personal care that a home receives.

         In deciding whether to grant a classification, the Secretary of the Department is guided by principles formulated by the Minister, known as the nursing home classification principles. The Secretary of the Department may at any time review the classification of a resident. If, on the basis of this review, the Secretary decides that the resident has been wrongly classified, the Secretary may revoke the classification and substitute a higher or lower classification. Currently the Secretary is not required to have regard to the nursing home classification principles when reviewing a resident's classification. This is an anomaly, because the purpose of the classification principles is to ensure that all resident classifications are determined by classification principles which are universally applied, according to relative care need. Therefore, this Bill proposes to amend the Act to require the Secretary to observe the nursing home classification principles when reviewing a resident's classification.

         There exists a further anomaly in regard to reviews of classifications. If the review classification is lower than the original classification, the review classification currently takes effect from the date of the review. This is despite the fact that the wrong classification has applied from the date of the original classification. This Bill proposes to amend the period of effect of a review by the Secretary so that the review classification is for the same period as the original classification.

         This also means a nursing home will not have as long to wait for a further review of the classification. At present, in the case of a reduced classification, the nursing home has to wait until the review classification has been in force for 12 months. This can be up to one year after the original classification would have expired and delays the opportunity for the nursing home to seek a further classification in cases where the resident's care needs have changed.

         The proposed amendment will mean that the nursing home will receive a positive or negative adjustment to future funding depending on whether the review classification is higher or lower than the original assessment by the nursing home. This will ensure an appropriate level of funding for the entire 12-month classification period. The nursing home will be able to apply for a further annual classification at the end of that time. The Bill ensures that the new arrangements applying to the period of effect of a review classification, if that review lowers a category, will apply only to classifications determined on or after the date of assent to the Bill.

         The Bill also makes amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act designed to increase equity with regard to hostel subsidies by providing higher subsidies for financially disadvantaged persons, or FDPs. The amendments provide for an increase in funding for each FDP hostel resident, offset by a reduction in funding for non-FDP hostel residents who have been assessed for personal care, PC. It is intended that at all levels of care within a hostel there will be a $3.20 a day subsidy difference between FDP and non-FDP residents.

         The recently introduced hostel personal care arrangements are based on the assessment of the relative care need of each individual, not their financial status or capacity to pay. This principle is unchanged. Those with higher care needs will continue to get higher subsidies. However, the subsidy at each level will also reflect the financial status of the resident. While some hostels will be disadvantaged in terms of subsidies available, the extent to which hostels will be affected will depend on the financial status of the residents.

         In addition to amendments to the aged care area the Bill makes amendments to the arrangements regarding payment of Medicare benefits in relation to R-type diagnostic imaging services. The amendment of subsection 16B(11) of the Health Insurance Act provides for the extension by two years, to 1 January 1995, of the sunset provisions. Under the current sunset provision, from 1 January 1993 Medicare benefits will no longer be payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by medical practitioners who were exempted by the grandparent provisions in the 1991 amendments dealing with arms-length requesting of these services. An extension will allow for the continuation of the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type services in these circumstances. The amendments proposed will provide more time for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to develop accreditation guidelines for general practitioners who provide radiology services.

This included placing onus of proof that a valid referral took place on the specialist or the consultant physician, that is, the practitioner to whom the patient was referred rather than the referring practitioner.

The proposed amendments of section 4 in the National Health Act in part five of this Bill relate to the payment of Medicare benefits for visits by participating optometrists to private patients in hospital and approved day hospital facilities.

         While the 75 per cent benefit rebate is contained in the Health Insurance Act, it is linked to the professional service rendered to patients who are receiving hospital treatment as provided for in the National Health Act. When the Health Insurance Act was amended in 1987 to reduce the Medicare benefit for professional services rendered in a hospital or approved day hospital facilities to private patients from 85 per cent (maximum $20 gap) to 75 per cent flat, its unintended application to optometrical consultations was overlooked.

         Patients are not admitted to hospital for conditions requiring the services of an optometrist. An optometrist may visit a hospital as a social service to a patient who has broken his or her spectacles and requires a test for new spectacles. Such patients are most likely to be long stay, nursing home type patients. The 75 per cent flat rate benefit provides a disincentive for optometrists to bulk bill such patients—the majority of whom would be aged persons. Currently some 87 per cent of optometrical services are direct billed.

The Bill also closes a loophole which would enable a child, in respect of whom family allowance is not being paid because of the income or assets test, to be declared a disadvantaged person and thus be issued with a health care card and receive pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of patient contribution.

        </emphasis>
        . The report supported the continued existence and activities of the NCA and made 11 recommendations. The Government's response to the PJC report was tabled on 1 June 1992. The National Crime Authority Bill (No.2) 1992 amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in the manner foreshadowed in that response.

         The Bill establishes an office of Inspector-General of the NCA, endows it with appropriate functions and powers and provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between the NCA and the PJC about access to sensitive information held by the NCA. It also makes some small but important corrections to existing provisions of the NCA Act.

         The most significant change to the NCA Act introduced by these amendments is the new office of Inspector-General of the NCA. Clause 10 of the Bill will insert a new part IIIA in the NCA Act to make provision for this office. The PJC report proposed that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the NCA and its staff.

         Because the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA will differ in some respects from the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Bill will establish a separate office of Inspector-General of the NCA under the NCA Act. However, the Government intends that the occupant of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will also be appointed as Inspector-General of the NCA and, with this in mind, the new part IIIA is based as closely as practicable on the relevant provisions of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986.

         One major difference between the role of the Inspector-General in relation to the NCA and in relation to the intelligence and security agencies will be that he will not have the broad monitoring function in relation to the NCA which he has in relation to intelligence and security matters. General monitoring of the work of the NCA remains the responsibility of the Commonwealth-State Inter-governmental Committee—the IGC—and of the PJC, both of which are established under the NCA Act. A second major difference is that, in relation to the NCA, the Inspector-General will not investigate complaints which can be dealt with satisfactorily under existing complaints legislation or procedures applicable to a police force from which the subject of the complaint has been seconded to the NCA.

         Under new section 55AA, the recommendation to the Governor-General that a person be appointed Inspector-General may only be made after consultation with the IGC. The person so appointed will be able to hold the office in conjunction with another, and section 55AC will preserve the judicial status of a judge appointed to the office. The terms and conditions of the Inspector-General, as set out in division six of the new part IIIA, are compatible with those of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Under section 55AZE, where the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is also appointed Inspector-General of the NCA, staff may be appointed to assist him in both capacities.

Further, on request by the Minister, he will investigate whether NCA information to which access is sought by the PJC on the NCA is `sensitive information' as defined in the Bill, and will advise the Minister accordingly.

It is proposed that the Inspector-General be obliged to investigate all complaints including those which may have arisen before the passage of this Bill. As is appropriate, however, discretions are built into section 55AG which will enable him not to inquire into complaints which, for instance, are frivolous or vexatious or where, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry or further inquiry is not warranted. The latter category would include past complaints which, in the view of the Inspector-General, have been dealt with satisfactorily by the informal means of investigation which have existed hitherto.

The chairperson of the NCA will be required to advise the Inspector-General of his action in response to each report.

         The second main aspect of the Bill is the provision of a mechanism for resolving disagreement over what is often termed operational or sensitive information. In its recent report, the PJC sought clarification of its rights of access to information held by the NCA. Disputes about such information in the past have given rise to questions of parliamentary privilege. As foreshadowed in its response to the PJC report, the Government has decided to deal with this issue by providing, in a new subsection 55(2), that in the performance of its duties the PJC is entitled to require the chairperson of the NCA to produce to it any document held by the NCA or to divulge or communicate to it any information held by or known to the NCA—except to the extent that it is or contains sensitive information. `Sensitive information' is defined in an amendment set out in clause 3, as information the disclosure of which might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence, the effectiveness of an investigation by the NCA, or the operations of law enforcement agencies.

The Bill provides that the Minister may require the Inspector-General of the NCA to inquire into the matter, and the Inspector-General must do so in accordance with the inquiry provisions of the new part IIIA of the NCA Act. When the Inspector-General has reported to the Minister, the Minister will have to decide whether or not the information is sensitive, and notify the chairperson, the PJC and the Inspector-General of his decision. The Bill will also authorise the Minister to include reasons for the decision in the formal determination, where this can be done without disclosing sensitive information.

         Of the minor amendments included in the Bill, one affects section 29A of the NCA Act. This section only came into force in January this year and provides that NCA process issued under sections 28 or 29 may include a notation prohibiting disclosure of any information relating to the process. This conflicts with the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, which require agencies to record any disclosures on an individual's credit information file and to ensure that an individual can obtain access to his or her file. Access by an individual to a credit reference file bearing a note of disclosure to the NCA could seriously jeopardise an NCA investigation. Accordingly, clause 7 of the Bill will amend section 29A of the NCA Act to provide that, where the Privacy Act would require that a note be made of a disclosure made in response to NCA process and that process includes a notation requiring secrecy, the requirement to record the disclosure is postponed until the effect of the notation expires. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that this proposal is acceptable because of the particular circumstances. Disclosure is only temporarily prohibited and the policy underlying section 29A was thoroughly debated during its passage through Parliament last year.

Clause 9 of the Bill repeals those subsections.

         In conclusion, I would like briefly to reiterate some of the general points made in the statement tabled by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on 1 June. I believe the work of the NCA over the past eight years has by and large been very successful and that this reflects both the qualities of those who have worked in the NCA and the essential soundness of the legislative scheme into which Parliament put so much effort in 1983 and 1984. Nonetheless, there will continue to be a need for fine tuning of the legislation from time to time and I take this opportunity to thank the PJC again for the important contribution it has made to this process through its report

         —This is a cognate debate on the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which is in fact the resumption of the debate that was adjourned just prior to lunch. As my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said this morning, the coalition does not oppose these Bills. We acknowledge that they introduce a range of measures designed to assist those suffering most as a result of, in the infamous words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the recession we had to have. However, I want to confine my remarks to the Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 and specifically to the amendments to section 695 of the principal Act, the Social Security Act 1991. This section deals with the claims for sickness benefits.

         The amendments deal with what is described as the education leavers waiting period, which is the deferment period to be served by an education leaver claiming sickness allowance. I want to say at the outset that I am pleased the Government has brought this legislation down at a relatively early stage in this parliamentary session so that there has been and is now still time for due consideration and debate. Sadly, such was not the case back in May 1990, when the Government amended the social security legislation to set a deferment period equivalent to that imposed on claimants for unemployment benefits for anyone leaving the education system and claiming sickness benefits. That amendment, encompassed in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, was rammed through the House under guillotine in less than one hour. At the time, the then Minister for Social Security stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        People who would suffer severe financial hardship through this initiative may claim special benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        While that sounds fine in principle, the practical application of the Minister's statement is another matter. This is the reason why I have entered this debate. The Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 contains the following amendment to section 695:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (4) A person is not subject to an education leavers waiting period if the Secretary is satisfied that special benefit would be payable to the person during the waiting period if the person were subject to the waiting period.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, satisfying the Secretary to the Department of Social Security that a special benefit is warranted can be a harrowing experience. While it may be the Government's intention to honour its often stated commitment to social justice and the provision of a social welfare safety net, the Department of Social Security's way of assessing applications for special benefit has, in at least one case with which I am very familiar, worked against giving effect to legislative intent.

         It is a very serious matter, and I would like to show just how serious by drawing the attention of the House to the personal experience of one of my constituents. Back in April 1991, this young woman, whom I will not name in this House for reasons of privacy, was forced to withdraw from tertiary study as a result of extreme ill health. At the time it was evident that she faced a long term incapacity for work. Therefore, on 16 April 1991 she applied to the Department of Social Security for either sickness or special benefit.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The way in which that application was handled was documented in a Social Security Appeals Tribunal finding dated 11 June 1991. In summary, the events were as follows: first, the April application was apparently lost by the Department of Social Security, although a note on the applicant's file confirmed that she had been interviewed three days later; second, another file note indicated that she was advised by phone on 9 May 1991 that a deferment period of 13 weeks would be applied to her application; third, on 13 May 1991 she completed a new application for special benefit; fourth, a record of decision on her file indicated that special benefit should be rejected as a result of the application of the short term assets test—no written advice was provided on any of these decisions, information was given to her over the phone; and, fifth, a new decision not to pay sickness benefit was made on the basis that she had not suffered any loss of income as a result of incapacity.

         Not surprisingly, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal described the Department's case as `somewhat confused'. On 19 June 1991 the SSAT found that my constituent was entitled to the payment of special benefit from 13 May 1991. The Department, however, decided to appeal against the findings of the SSAT and, on 15 July 1991, it took the matter to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Again, the Department's appeal was unsuccessful. The Department then decided to take the matter before the Federal Court. By this time my constituent had raised her concerns with the Ombudsman and, on 27 May 1992, Senior Assistant Ombudsman, M. J. Williamson, from the Canberra office of the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman, made the following statement in a letter to my constituent:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are convinced, as I know you are, that DSS's overall performance in your case has been unsatisfactory, to put it modestly. Your file is replete with examples of poor administration, including repeated failure to reply to your enquiries or to keep you informed in any other way. With the exception of one or two officers, the Department appears to have ignored your right to be treated with courtesy and consideration. It is disturbing, for example, that you found out that the Department intended to appeal to the Federal Court from Mr Hedges—

        and not from the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 30 July this year, the saga which began back in April 1991 came to an end when Mr Justice Lee of the Federal Court dismissed the Department's appeal. Throughout the whole of this process the Government would have incurred tens of thousands of dollars in costs—all over the matter of some $900. In the judgments of both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, reference was made to the case, turning very much on its own special circumstances. The point of this is that the Department's pursuit of this matter can hardly be regarded as an important test case. After all, a special benefit is just that; it is a benefit granted in special cases of severe hardship, with each case being judged according to the individual's particular circumstances.

         For this reason alone, it is not unreasonable to describe the Department's pursuit of appeal after appeal, to the point of legal exhaustion, as a monumental waste of taxpayers' money and government resources. I would be interested to know whether the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett)—he can take this on notice—could tell the House what the case actually cost, including the cost in time of officers of his Department who could not perform their normal functions while appearing before the SSAT, the AAT and the Federal Court, not to mention the cost of flying departmental people and legal representatives to Perth. Although my constituent's case was eventually resolved in her favour, her experience has been a traumatic one. The stresses and strains of being involved in three appeals and waiting some 15 months for a final resolution have aggravated the ill health which forced her to withdraw from her studies in the first place and have severely retarded her recovery.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problems which she experienced were in large part due to the short term available funds test used by the Department in assessing claims for special benefit. Under this particular test, the Department considers that a person is in severe financial hardship only if he has less than the equivalent of two weeks benefit. For my constituent that amount was $154.10. This short term available funds test is seriously flawed and totally unbalanced, as it does not in any way take account of any financial commitments and liabilities. In this particular case, just one liability amounted to $52 per week. That was the sum of money needed by my constituent each week to meet ongoing medical expenses not covered by Medicare. Perhaps this test was designed for people experiencing a one or two week waiting period. However, a 13 week waiting period can hardly be described as short term. Mr Justice Lee of the Federal Court said in his finding:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The direction vested in the Secretary was provided for the clear purpose of alleviating hardship or ameliorating what would otherwise be unnecessary harshness in the operation of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        These concerns which are reflected here are ones I share, and that is why I have raised them in this debate. It is all very well for the Government to legislate to overcome hardship, but it must ensure that its Department administers its legislation in a way which is consistent with meeting that objective. The extremely harsh, short term available funds test is not set out in legislation; it is contained within departmental guidelines and is defective as a result of ignoring liabilities. This deficiency was highlighted by P. Johnson, Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Page 18 of the AAT's finding against the Department's appeal states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the Tribunal notes that the Special Benefit Claim Form makes no provision for off-setting liabilities and to that extent does not provide a basis on which an accurate assessment can be made of the claimant's actual financial circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Court judgment of Mr Justice Lee also drew attention to this problem. Page 21 of that judgment states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The printed form provided by the Department for application for a special benefit requested a claimant to supply details of monies to which the claimant had access. The form did not request a statement of any of the current liabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly—and this is the thrust of my case—it is up to the Government to ensure that this situation is remedied and that departmental guidelines accord with the substance and spirit of the law. My constituent and her family have been through a very trying experience. It is their earnest desire—and I speak on their behalf—that no-one else should suffer the same fate. In order to try to help others who might be caught in a similar bureaucratic trap, they have researched and written two detailed and well-balanced papers which offer constructive comments on legislative and administrative arrangements for income support. The first of these papers was submitted to the Government's task force on management improvement within the Australian Public Service and it has been very well received. The other has been forwarded recently to the parliamentary inquiry into legislative and legal drafting by the Commonwealth. This inquiry is currently being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

         As far as the circumstances surrounding my constituent's case are concerned, I sincerely hope that both the task force and the Committee will take good account of the submissions before them and that some good will come of this family's unhappy experience. The amendment to the social security legislation which is currently before the House has the potential to make life a little easier for those who, like my constituent, are forced to withdraw from the education system as a result of ill health. However, this potential will be realised only if both government legislation and the administrative arrangements within the Department are in accord. Unless legislation and administration work in harmony the Department of Social Security will be unable to meet the terms of its charter, which are:

         —Today we are dealing with certain social security amendment Bills which, ostensibly at least, are designed to assist people during these very difficult times. The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 proposes to allow people access to half of their family allowance payment as a lump sum. This no doubt will help people; although I worry a little that it is another example of this Government's Bankcard mentality. Certainly, people do not have to borrow this money, but by getting it in advance they naturally will find it more difficult once they have  spent the money. One might wonder in that regard whether this has more to do with an election date and giving people a little more spending money to maybe affect some statistics around Australia than it has to do with people's welfare. If that is the case, I would certainly condemn this action.

         It is very easy to see why we can compensate for a GST. It is out in the open; it is up-front. It will be printed on every docket, be it at the supermarket or on a docket received for some other things. It is clear for people to see in the first instance. Down at the bowser there will be no more of this business of ripping 26c a litre off people and not telling them. We will no longer see the price of petrol go up and not know who is getting the money—be it the Government, the retailer or the wholesaler—because it will be shown separately. The coalition is determined to ensure that that occurs at every level. The first thing the public will be able to do is make a judgment as to what would be appropriate compensation.

If, for instance, one had a taxable income of $10,000 a year, the tax rate would be 5c in the dollar. At the more recognisable and more typical income of $20,000 a year, the tax would be 10c in the dollar. There is a substantial reduction in the tax burden at the income tax level, giving people money to take home to confront a 3 or 4 per cent increase. But it does not stop there. I found it interesting when I was shadow Minister for health to have identified to me how many single mothers have private health insurance. They do it because they are terrified of the current system. We had someone lauding it at Question Time today.

         I want to relate a story about the Swan District Hospital, which I think is in the electorate of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). A 21-year-old girl, a close friend of my daughter's, fell off a horse early on Saturday morning and broke her arm in a very bad way above the elbow and below the shoulder. She went to the Swan District Hospital, which gave her some aspirin, sent her home and told her to come back on Monday because orthopaedic surgeons no longer worked on weekends. The outrageous part about that is that they did not even have the decency to ask her whether she had private health insurance—which she did—and direct her to a private hospital, where she certainly would have received assistance. They might also have told her to go to the casualty section of Royal Perth Hospital. I became aware of this on Saturday night when the young lady was vomiting through pain, and we were able to assist her.

         These sorts of things happen, but the tragedy of that example is that the young lady accepted it. People have lost so much confidence in the health system that she believed the system could not look after her on weekends. She just went home. She is not dumb—she has a highly paid position in a solicitor's office—but she believed that people cannot be fixed up in Australia on a weekend. That is a great indictment of the system. That is a matter of fact. The young lady's name is available if anybody wants to try to disprove what I am saying. I did not know what to do. I was devastated to think things were so bad in Australia.

         These are the sorts of problems we have, but what do we do about them? Supporting mothers, on very limited incomes, are taking out private health insurance because they do not trust the health system. What is the Opposition saying to those supporting mothers? We are saying, `We'll give you a $400 a year special rebate. It is a tax rebate, but it applies even if you have no income. We will send you a refund cheque'. To the elderly we are saying, `If you are on a pension, we will put it up by 8 per cent to compensate a perceived 3 to 4 per cent increase in your cost of living brought about by our consumption tax'. What are we saying to all the other pensioners—supporting mothers and unemployed mothers? We are saying, `We'll increase yours by 6 per cent'. What are we saying to the elderly?

We are giving them a 30 per cent tax cut, doubling their family allowance and increasing the dependent spouse rebate, et cetera. While the Government gets on with the idea of withholding taxes on their meagre interest earnings on their small savings accounts, we are saying that they can have some interest income free of tax.

Then there is the fuel tax that we will eliminate and the payroll tax component that is built in all the way back from the iron ore miner.

         Government members say there is no tax on bread, but how many times is a truck involved before we get a loaf of bread? I can tell honourable members quickly, because we have done the research, how many times payroll tax, sales tax and fuel tax impact on a package of butter: 220 times. And Government members say there is no tax on it! The trouble is that they find it extremely difficult to calculate and, as Dr Harding reminds them, they therefore do not compensate. Only a GST can be clearly identified. As a result, it is only then that governments can give proper compensation, as the coalition properly provides.

         We will support this legislation, but we do not perceive that giving people in receipt of family allowance a bit of money in advance and then letting them be poor six months later is the solution. We will double the family allowance. We will increase the family allowance supplement. We know what Government members are up to: they want to feed out this $100, or whatever it is, to people so that for a brief period they will feel a bit more comfortable—about the time the Government has an election. It is very cynical, because this is a serious problem.

         The bishops tell Government members the problem, and their own public servants tell them the problem, but they get up here and say, `There is no tax on a loaf of bread'. If there is 10 per cent tax on that loaf of bread—and I believe there will be by the time the freight aspect is considered—and 15 per cent is added after that tax is taken off, the increase is 3 or 4 per cent. That is exactly what we, the Federal Treasury and everybody else says will be the CPI effect of our introducing this tax. Yet Government members stand up whenever they think there is no-one who is competent there to criticise them and start telling people that everything is going up by 15 per cent. Their own public servants say something different.

The simple fact is that the Government's own public servants have told it where it has put the poorer people in our community. The Government gives them no tax cuts. Those opposite just want to pick up the ones they think they do not already have. No justice, no decency, and it has a consumption tax system for which its own Public Service says one cannot compensate for. Of course, while the Government has all that burden on it, that $19 billion, what are those opposite talking about a lousy $100 for?  It is a waste of time and it is a disgrace.

I notice that the extra gift to pensioners will start in March 1993. This echoes the Wills by-election when there was suddenly $125 extra given to families just before that by-election. This would not be part of an election strategy would it, Minister, to fool those low incomes earners that they might be a little better off? But they will not be because once they spend that $100-odd up-front they will not get it later. When low income earners go down to the deli to pay for their baked beans, their butter or whatever, the money will not be there because it was spent earlier.

         Let us have a look at what this so-called Labor Government has done to the poor people in this country, to families in this country. Figures taken by the Social Policy Research Centre of the University of New South Wales show that between 1983 and 1990 families with average incomes or below experienced a drop of 4 per cent in real disposable income. Between 1983 and 1991 the percentage of children living in poverty actually increased, with 1.85 million Australians now living below the Henderson poverty line and 1.1 million living in absolute poverty. In 1982-83, the average after-tax earnings of an average family with a dependant spouse and two children was $24,891 in 1989 dollar terms. In 1989, after six years of a Labor government, that family's after-tax earnings dropped by $1,291 to $23,000. That is what this Labor Government has done for the families of Australia.

         But they are not the only figures available which show what has happened to families in Australia under this Government. Let us look at some work done by the School of Economic and Financial Studies at Macquarie University in an article by Marc Lombard entitled `Income Distribution in Australia 1983-1989'. One table in this article tells us what has happened to the top one per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent of income earners compared with the bottom group of income earners. In 1982-83, the top 5 per cent received 13 per cent of income but by 1988-89 that had risen to 18 per cent. These high income earners had increased their percentage of income quite considerably. Over the same period the bottom 20 per cent decreased; they went from 8.24 to 6.79. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.

         If we further examine some of these figures that Mr Lombard has produced, we see that in 1983 the top 5 per cent of income earners had a 1 1/2 times greater share of the national income cake than those in the bottom 20 per cent. That was bad enough; however, what happens after six years of Labor Government?  By that time, the top 5 per cent had increased their share of the national cake compared with the lowest 20 per cent by 2 1/2 times. That is under this so-called social justice government, the Labor Government which is supposedly for the poor, for the lower income earners. Again I say,  what hypocrisy. Mr Lombard's article states:

         Translated into numbers of taxpayers, it means that, in 1982/83, some 61,000 high-income earners had a taxable income equivalent to that of 672,000 low-income earners. Six years later, the 79,000 taxpayers representing the top 1% of income-earners were earning as much as the bottom 1,666,000 income-earners.

        The Minister does not seem to be taking any interest in this. I take it that he does not care what has happened to the poor and to the 200,000 households that are on public waiting lists. As we have mentioned public housing lists, let us have a look at what has happened under this Government to the affordability of housing. I refer to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Affordability of Australian Housing

        by the National Housing Strategy. What does it say this Government has done to housing affordability? If we look at 1982, we see that families on lower average weekly earnings spent $117 a week in 1990 dollars on their house payment. By 1988, that had risen to $129, which is a considerable portion of a family's income. However, when we look at the base that is needed for people to buy a house—the deposit they have to pay—the situation is considerably worse. In 1983, the deposit for an average house required 109.6 per cent of the average income. By 1990, that had risen to 215.8 per cent; it had doubled. That is what has happened under this Government.

         I turn now to an article mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor entitled `The Incidence of Wholesale Sales Tax and Excises in Late 1991'. The Minister asked the honourable member for O'Connor whether he had read the article. I will be quoting from that article. Let us look at what happens to families' incomes because of this Labor Government's hidden taxes—not all its taxes, just the wholesale sales tax and the excise. What does that do to the average family or, more importantly perhaps, families on low incomes? Of a gross income of $290.70, it takes $31.30 per week; that is, 10.8 per cent of a family's income goes on the Government's hidden consumption taxes. The GST, which those opposite like to say is a consumption tax, is going to hit poor families. The Government omits to say that it already has hidden consumption taxes hitting those families: $31.30 per week, which is 10.8 per cent of their gross income.

The Government has hit the lower income people: 10.8 per cent of their gross income goes in hidden consumption taxes, while the rich have only 5 per cent. I want to make it clear that those figures are rated for families on lower incomes. That table takes into account the number of children in the family.

        That is exactly what Fightback does. We have said that low income earners will be hit by the indirect taxes, but we can overcome that. We make some attempt to compensate them, but the present Government does not. The present Government has reduced families to poverty.

         For the edification of the Minister, as he does not seem to be aware of it, I will briefly go through what Fightback offers to families; what this Liberal Government will give to families to help pick them up from the shambles that 10 years of this Labor Government has left them in. First, family allowances will be doubled for families with combined incomes below $30,000 per annum. For a low income family with two children, currently getting $41.80, that amount will be doubled; they will get over $80—an increase of over $40. It makes the Government's lump sum payment of $100-odd pale into insignificance.

         Fightback is weighted towards the lower income earners, because families with combined incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 will have their family allowances increased by 50 per cent, while families with combined incomes of over $40,000 will receive a 6 per cent increase in their family allowance. A family allowance supplement will be maintained and increased by 6 per cent. The independent spouse rebate will be increased by $300 per annum. That again will phase out as incomes rise over $75,000. We have $90m set aside to help lower income families cope with the problem of child care. Family crisis care is needed because those opposite have put families into crisis. The Government has sent them to St Vincent de Paul; to the local community church—to whoever will give them a handout to help them get through the week. We are going to help those people. We are going to help my local churches that are absolutely inundated with requests. We will be giving $50m to help those voluntary organisations help the people that those opposite have sent into poverty.

         On the subject of taxation, the honourable member for O'Connor dealt with the way that we will cut taxation for the lower income people. I remind the Minister that One Nation did not cut their tax; it cut the tax of those people in the next income bracket. So, under this Government, people on the lower incomes will still pay 20c in the dollar. Under our proposal they will pay only 16.2c. What is more, under our proposal, the tax threshold will rise from $5,400 to $7,000, which will be a boon for lower income families.

         With the first home owners scheme, families earning up to $40,000 and saving to buy their first home will be eligible for a one-off payment of $2,000. There will also be a health rebate for those families paying private health insurance. Finally, for young people trying to buy a house, to increase housing affordability $1,000 of interest on new savings will be tax free. This Government cannot even come close to any of that. The best it can offer is to take some of its child allowance up front and pay it back later.

         —in reply—It is interesting that this debate today on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been extraordinarily wide ranging, covering a series of issues that have very little to do with the legislation, I must say. But I want to concentrate on some of the specifics that have been raised in the debate before I get on to the more general points made by Opposition and Government members.

         I begin with the very obvious statement, to counter some of the nonsense that has been uttered by the Opposition today, that the Keating Government is very much committed to the notion of social justice for all Australians and these two pieces of legislation, along with some of the other changes that the Government has made over the last few years, amply demonstrate that commitment. It is significant that very few of the Opposition members were prepared to knock in any way the propositions being put forward in the legislation dealing with the options for family allowance payment and with the education leavers waiting periods.

         In opening the debate, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said that he saw family allowance as not being intended as a series of lump sum payments. This is certainly not the proposal that is in the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2). The point is that it is an option to receive the payment as a lump sum. It is all about flexibility in terms of providing options to people who wish to take advantage of them. It is interesting that in his contribution he referred to the education leavers waiting period, yet there is no specific mention of that notion in Fightback. He went on to say that the Opposition has reduced the waiting periods in its employment strategy, but he was not talking about the education leavers waiting period. As I understand it, he was talking about people on Job Search allowance who get a job and lose it within a period of three months; they will not be required to serve a further waiting period for the Job Search allowance.

         Aspects in Fightback relating to changes in family allowance were also raised by members of the Opposition and I would like to make some comment about them. Finally, there was the usual rhetoric we have come to expect from Opposition members about the benefits of the 15 per cent consumption tax.

         Right throughout this debate there was a theme about families and really, I suppose, an attempt to stereotype families within the community. Some of the speeches from Opposition members today showed that they are very much aligned to the stereotype view of what constitutes a family. Indeed, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Fightback!
         </emphasis>
         document presents an image of an average Australian family story, with Mike, the housewife, Sally, and their two children. I for one do not deny in any way that that constitutes a family. But I point out that that stereotype view of a family within Australia represents about 22 per cent of all households. For example, tonight in Sydney there are probably upwards of one million people living alone in houses. Those people surely would see themselves as part of a family, but they do not fit this picket fence stereotype view of a family that we have come to expect from the Opposition.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is worth while pointing out some of the down sides in the Fightback material because they have not been brought out in this debate when we have heard notions of social justice echoed by some of the Opposition speakers. For example, during my time in the House during the debate, I heard no mention of any of the Opposition's proposals to slash $10 billion from government expenditure. There was no mention of the fact that part of that $10 billion involves cuts in the social security budget of about $2.4 billion. Of course, all of this would be compounded very much by the extraordinarily regressive consumption tax that would be put on a whole range of products and services that people use.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We heard a lot of rhetoric about the changes in family allowance proposed in Fightback. But, again, I do not recall hearing anything about the fact that under the Opposition's arrangements no family allowance will be payable once a family's income reaches $55,000 per annum. There are about 115,000 families with a joint gross income above $55,000 who would lose about $10 per week under the Opposition's proposal. With average weekly earnings now at over $30,000 a year, one can quickly do the sums and work out that a lot of two-income families would receive not one cent under the Opposition's proposal.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is also a little unclear as to whether the proposed income threshold is in 1991 dollars or 1994 dollars. If the $55,000 is to apply in 1994, its relative value is even less. What those opposite are really saying is that people on salaries over $46,000 would not be paid any family allowance. That would mean that about 300,000 families would get not even one cent of family allowance.

         The other interesting aspect of the Opposition's proposals is that there would be very significant poverty traps for families at the $30,000 and $40,000 thresholds. For example, a three-child family earning $29,900 would receive $120 per fortnight in family allowance but, if the income increased by just $100 per annum to $30,000 the family would face a $30 per fortnight drop in the family allowance. Significantly, that would disadvantage a lot of middle income families.

         Another interesting part of the debate related to the issue of sole parent pensioners in our community. Again, there was no mention of the fact that under the Opposition's Fightback proposals once the youngest child of a sole parent pensioner turned 12 years of age, the pensioner would no longer be eligible for that pension. Again, some 30,000 people would clearly lose their entitlement to the sole parent pension. Many sole parent pensioners within the community represent the very low end of the socio-economic spectrum within society.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Again, it is a case of this stereotype image; the Opposition tends to move in very quickly on the sole parent pensioners. It forgets about the jobs, education and training scheme and the fact that JET has assisted more than 80,000 sole parent pensioners since its introduction in 1989. The proportion of sole parent pensioners on earned income has increased from 9 per cent in 1983 to 21 per cent in 1992. Similarly, labour force participation for sole parent pensioners rose from 44 per cent to 55 per cent. In other words, the very positive steps that this Labor Government has taken have had a remarkable impact upon the sole parent pensioner client group within the Department of Social Security.

         I turn to the goods and services tax. We heard a lot about the 15 per cent consumption tax during the debate. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) claims that the GST would result in price rises of a little over 4 per cent. But again, when people go through the Treasury analysis of some elements of the GST, I think they can make their own judgments as to the way in which it would impact upon families—that food prices would rise by about 8.9 per cent overall; dairy products by 9.6 per cent; clothing by 11.2 per cent; electricity costs by 10.7 per cent; and health services by a staggering 22.6 per cent.

         All of those particular goods, all of those particular services, are the sorts of goods and services that families in Australia have to deal with on a day by day basis. The Opposition claims that all social security pensioners and beneficiaries, family allowance supplement recipients and education allowance recipients would receive adequate compensation for the price effects of the goods and services tax. However, the Opposition's compensation promises are really dependant upon the achievement of its estimated price rise of just over 4 per cent from the package. Under the Opposition's proposals, Australians would be committed to a permanently higher rate of inflation. The impact of that on housing would, of course, be fairly dramatic.

         I turn to some of the individual contributions made by other members during the debate, and in particular I wish to comment on some of the extraordinary claims made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). In the course of the debate he talked about the proposal of allowing people the option to bring forward $135.85 every six months as a `grubby little bribe'. I challenge the honourable member for McPherson to go out among his constituents and suggest to them that what the Government is proposing is some `grubby little bribe'. What we are doing is allowing people the option, the flexibility, to make their own judgments. That judgment, that option, is based on research that has been conducted by the Department of Social Security into representations that have been made to us by government and, I am sure, by Opposition members, which have very strongly endorsed the option of providing this form of payment to families.

It gets back to this extraordinarily narrow definition that Opposition members continue to use about families in the course of this debate. I thought the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) gave an extraordinarily strong reply to the challenge issued by the honourable member for McPherson to address the ALP's commitment to families. In my view, he did so admirably, not that there was any great challenge from the contribution by the honourable member for McPherson to do so.

         The honourable member for O'Connor talked about the Harding study on the GST, as did the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus). Generally speaking, of course, indirect taxes are reggressive but, importantly, our wholesale sales tax system exempts most food and clothing, while taxing luxury items at a much higher rate. It is certainly less regressive than any notion of a 15 per cent goods and services tax on virtually everything one cares to name.

         It is also very clear that the Fightback package would see a very dramatic shift to indirect taxation in this country and would certainly change the nature of the very progressive taxation system that we have.

         Opposition members referred to Dr Harding's paper. What they conveniently forget to mention is that her analysis of the Fightback package also found that not everyone would be worse off as a result of the GST. Only 70 per cent of members of the population would be worse off, and they are the ordinary wage and salary earners that many people sometimes forget. Those who would gain the most are higher income earners. For example, families earning $90,000 or more would be up to $105 a week better off, while struggling families would certainly bear the brunt of the goods and services tax.

         Overall it has been a fascinating debate in one sense. We have heard very little about the education leaver waiting period. We have heard very little criticism of the option of allowing people to bring forward their family allowance payment. Clearly, most of the Opposition members in the course of this debate ranged fairly widely in their remarks. In many cases, their remarks were very much at odds with the specific aspects of this debate. Nonetheless, it is worth while to reflect on those comments and for people to make their own judgment. As we get closer to the next election, people will certainly make their judgments about the relative merits of the contribution of this Government with respect to social justice and those notions of social justice that we hear about from the Opposition.

These two particular, very specific measures in the Department of Social Security are a further indication of the progressive changes that this Government has been making, and I commend the Bills to the House.

         —The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill makes a number of changes to the Development Allowance Authority Act to widen the scope and increase the flexibility of the development allowance provided for in the original legislation. The amendments contained in this Bill will allow the aggregation of new productive facilities with other projects, consisting of the expansion, upgrading or improvement of existing facilities where the new and existing productive facilities are vertically integrated.

         Two new types of scheme are introduced with this legislation and are described as an individual project scheme, and a joint venture project scheme. These new types of schemes will allow projects involving new productive facilities to be added to projects involving such things as the expansion of existing productive facilities to qualify for the allowance, and meet the $50m threshold test.

         The Bill provides for greater flexibility in combining purchased and leased assets in a project to be aggregated so that it can meet the $50m threshold test for the granting of the allowance. A mechanism is also introduced whereby a lessor can claim the development allowance benefit by way of a pre-qualifying certificate that has been issued by the Development Allowance Authority to the lessee.

         There is also to be a new vertical integration test, and a number of other consequential amendments to the original legislation. The development allowance and the Development Allowance Authority that administers it are both creatures of the Government's `One Nation: One Job' statement in February of this year. It was one of a host of Government initiatives that seek a solution to Australia's problems by throwing taxpayers money around in an attempt to get the economy moving again.

         As was predictable, it is the various one job initiatives that have been one of the major contributors to the blow out in the Budget deficit which is itself one of the country's main economic problems. The Government is thus trying to cure our economic difficulties by exacerbating one of the elements of the overall economic problem, for which it is largely responsible. This is a strategy that is

         The `One Job' statement and the many initiatives associated with it, such as the Development Allowance Authority, have since largely vanished from the political arena. The `One Nation: One Job' statement lasted all of one day, before being buried under the weight of its essential irrelevance to solving of economic problems.

         Australia's unemployed could do without a government that is obsessed with railway tracks and all the other infrastructure white elephants being promoted by this Government as the solution for our problems.

         Australia's public sector infrastructure is a chronic under-performer by world standards, and throwing more money into public sector investment is not going to deliver a reasonable return without fundamental micro-economic reforms on the railways, the water-front and in a host of other areas. It is little wonder then that the response to One Nation has been so underwhelming. This Bill can be seen as a forlorn attempt to revitalise one of the `One Job' statement's taxation initiatives.

         As I shall demonstrate, the development allowance is a complete failure as a means of revitalising and sustaining business investment in this country, which has reached a record in the low levels attained in recent years. The coalition opposed the development allowance legislation when it was first introduced in the autumn sittings this year. There is nothing in this Bill that would cause us to modify our original evaluation as to the establishment of the development allowance and the Authority that will administer it. There are numerous problems with this whole concept of government administered development allowances which grant concessional tax treatment for the cost of acquiring new plant and equipment.

         The `One Job' statement laid down a number of criteria that an investment project must satisfy to qualify for the development allowance. In order to receive the allowance, a project must be shown to be world competitive—in the language of the `One Job' statement—as to the proposed practices of employers and employees and the practices of all levels of government under which the project must operate. World competitive projects are to be identified, in terms of the legislation, on the basis of an absence of industry assistance or protection; positive facilitation by local and State governments, with the Commonwealth Government providing complementary action where required; and world best practice in industrial relations.

         It is doubtful, however, whether the investment projects which may attract the development allowance will exhibit these qualities or live up to these criteria in the manner suggested by the Government. Despite the legislated injunction against industry assistance, the requirement for positive facilitation by other levels of government is virtually a standing requirement that State and local governments provide assistance of one type or another for projects within their jurisdiction in order that those projects might qualify for the allowance. The allowance thus encourages, and possibly effectively requires, State and local governments to get into the business of picking winners and introducing a mass of distortion into the economy as a result.

         All this begs the question: why do these projects need special tax breaks if they are indeed already world competitive? After all, that is one of the criteria for getting the allowance. World competitive projects run on the basis of best international practice should not require any assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of tax breaks which must ultimately be paid for by other taxpayers who will be required to bear a heavier tax burden as a consequence. If these projects were less than world competitive, we should be even less inclined to support them in this way.

The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) noted in his second reading speech to the original Bill that the allowance will provide firms with additional leverage to negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda. Again, this suggests that allowance recipients are less than fully competitive at the time of granting of the allowance if they have progress to make in achieving so-called best practice.

         Overall, this legislation reeks of the now thoroughly discredited practice of governments attempting to pick winners. This is made abundantly clear in the descriptions of this measure provided by the Government. The Minister, in his second reading speech to the original legislation, said:

        So this legislation is designed to reward success, which sounds just like another attempt at picking winners to me. Furthermore, what the Minister conveniently forgets is that those policies of the past that he rightly observes underwrote loss and failure also sought to reward success in much the same way as the development allowance intends. The fact that those policies of the past ended up underwriting loss and failure was an entirely unintended consequence of those policies.

         As I have already indicated, the Government has no business underwriting success, in any case. Successful businesses can and do look after themselves.

         There are a host of other problems with the development allowance as it is presently constituted. The total capital cost threshold of $50m is arbitrary and obviously highly distortionary. It encourages the vertical integration of production processes for the purpose of claiming the allowance, even though such integration may not be optimal in terms of a particular production process. Highly efficient and productive capital projects which just happen to fall below the $50m threshold do not qualify for the allowance. The result is a potential misallocation of resources in favour of larger investment projects at the expense of smaller, potentially more productive, projects and at the cost of overall economic efficiency.

But it would be naive to think that this was of any real concern to the Government, in any event. The Government's real objective with the development allowance is to get a few big ticket capital projects registered with the Development Allowance Authority before the end of 1992, so that they can be touted by the Government at the next election as evidence of some sort of recovery in business investment. That is why the competitiveness test has been waived, but only until the end of the year. The Minister gave the game away in his second reading speech to the original legislation, when he said:

         The Parliamentary Secretary then spoke about the need for `selective industry assistance', and said that we must look at the Asian tigers, Germany and Japan `to find the way forward'. He completely ignored the Industry Commission's detailed criticisms of selective industry assistance made in its 1989-90 annual report. There is a chapter in that report entitled `Strategic Trade Theory and the East Asian Experience', which demonstrates exactly why the approach taken with this legislation is precisely the wrong way to go. The Industry Commission concluded:

        The Parliamentary Secretary also spoke of some of his experiences with the major projects facilitation unit, in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. He spoke of a mineral development that apparently depended for its viability on the availability of this allowance. This is just further evidence of the fact that the allowance will be used by the Government to underpin marginal investments that are undercompetitive in the normal course of events. The naivety of the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter is alarming, and one would hope that in future he will pay more attention to the Industry Commission than to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in such matters.

Governments and their bureaucrats have no special insight in considering these matters. More commonly, governments are thoroughly ignorant of the market and the demands it places on industry. If governments have no special knowledge in these matters, then they have nothing to contribute to the judgments that entrepreneurs already make in a market context, on a daily basis.

It could lower business costs by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports, so that Australian business could access goods at world prices.

Our facilitation of major development projects will not be driven by pre-election politics in the manner of the Government's `One Job' statement initiatives. We will instead work to lower business costs and provide tax incentives across the board, to the great benefit of all Australians.

For example, he talked about many of the investment projects which were mentioned as part of the infrastructure projects in the One Nation statement as being white elephants. I think he talked about the rail and the road proposals and so on. If it is a white elephant to improve the rail gauges so that freight can be moved around Australia without having to change trains and without delays being occasioned, I guess it is a white elephant. The micro-economic reforms to which the honourable member referred, particularly on the waterfront, have seen a reduction in manpower of 47 per cent and enormous improvements in turnaround times in comparison to what occurred in years gone by. Obviously, that is the white elephant that he is talking about. Maybe we need a few more of those sorts of white elephants.

When I went back and looked at some of the criticisms that had been levelled at the original legislation when it was introduced into this Parliament, I wondered why the Opposition chose to vote against it.

Interestingly, they were not against the spirit of the legislation; they were against it because it did not go far enough. In fact, three things come to mind about this press release. First, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that those opposite opposed the legislation because the development allowance would discriminate against projects with a capital cost of less than $50m, so the $50m threshold we had was not good enough; secondly, he said that it would not be available for investment in plant and equipment in all areas of the economy; and, thirdly, he said that it did not apply to projects commenced prior to 31 December 1992.

         I dispute the assertion that this Government is into a `picking winners' scenario. If one looks at the history of the assistance given to business generally by this Government, one sees that it has been applied across the board with equity and fairness. The changes that have been occasioned in things such as company tax rates have applied across the board, rather than picking winners and going into certain areas. If one looks at some of the other issues associated with taxation generally, one sees that they are applied across the board and not in specific areas. It is a hallmark of this Government that it is prepared, in an industry policy sense, to suggest that, if an industry of any nature is to survive in the Australian economy, to be internationally competitive and to have a domestic base it has to stand on its own two feet, it indeed has to be internationally competitive, and it has to have all the things going for it which the honourable member for Curtin remarked upon.

If it had not been for this Government intervening in 1983 and bringing down the steel industry plan, we would not have a steel industry in this country.

         I think this has now been proven in New South Wales. His tenure as Minister for Public Works, with the development of Darling Harbour and his vision for a new tunnel under Sydney Harbour, has clearly demonstrated that he had not only a knowledge but also a thorough understanding of infrastructure needs for a major metropolitan area such as Sydney. Many people, not only Australians but tourists from all over the world, are reaping benefits from it now. It is amazing, is it not? At the time there were so many critics of his endeavours with the Darling Harbour project, but now I do not think one would find too many around.

         There was another thing that I found interesting, in a general sense, about the comments by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to the One Nation statement and the infrastructure spending as was announced and as has now come forward in this legislation. If he took the opportunity to read the newspapers from New South Wales today, he would find that his colleague from New South Wales, the Premier, Mr John Fahey, and the Treasurer, did exactly the same thing yesterday in the State Budget. They brought down a Budget which contained a massive infrastructure stimulatory effect, for the simple reason that governments, whether it be us or the other side, have a legitimate role to play in stimulating the economy. Interestingly, the State Government's Budget did not offer much in relation to health—it did not have much else of much worth in terms of looking after social issues—but, in terms of trying to put people into employment, it built on the lead given by this Government. To that extent, I suppose, we should give thanks for small mercies.

         It is important that legislation such as this be approved. It is important that it go through so that individual projects and joint venture projects in areas such as mining and other developments right around Australia can receive some assistance, provided they meet the strict criteria and guidelines laid down in this legislation. Clearly, it is not a matter of simply saying that an almost unviable or almost viable project will or will not get up for want of some assistance. That is not it at all. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions—and certainly at a major dinner in Sydney—that if projects are not viable governments cannot be expected to give them handouts to make them such.

         —The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill which is before the House this evening is nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Australian Labor Party Government to be seen on paper to be assisting business investment. In fact, it does no such thing. Whilst this Government dallies, major investors are leaving our shores in droves. Take, for example, Watties brand baked beans. My good friend and colleague from Queensland the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) well knows the Watties company and its brand of baked beans.

         Watties, a food processor, sources its navy beans from Kingaroy in Queensland. However, the beans then hightail it out of Kingaroy and go across the Tasman to New Zealand where they are processed, given a quick injection of tomato sauce, promptly canned and shipped back to the supermarket shelves of Australia. Watties has concluded that the cost of producing its baked beans in Australia is too great. The spirit of this Bill will not encourage Watties to process Australian-grown food products in Australia for consumption in Australia.

         Unfortunately, there are countless cases similar to the Watties baked beans scenario. This Government has been the great architect of missed opportunities and job losses. In fact, job exportation is one of the Government's greatest growth industries. Testimony to this fact is our double digit unemployment level. Business investment has dropped in 1991-92 for the third successive year by a massive 16.3 per cent and is forecast to remain negative in the forthcoming year. Private and corporate confidence has been crushed by high interest rates, accumulated debt, industrial relations inefficiencies and unreasonable government taxes and charges. If this Government were serious about investment in Australia it would abolish payroll tax, wholesale tax, fuel excise tax and cut personal income tax. But quite clearly it is not serious about seeing investment prosper in Australia.

The Government then has to bring down real interest rates and cut business costs through micro-economic reform and industrial relations reform. Instead, the Government recently handed down a $13.4 billion Budget deficit—a clear indication that it has had to step in where the private sector fears to tread while this Government has the treasury bench. The private sector fears to tread because it is offered no long term reliable industry policies.

         The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill has come about as a result of constraints and inefficiencies in the principal Act. The principal Act provided for the establishment of the Development Allowance Authority which determines the eligibility of projects with a gross capital cost of $50m or more. Furthermore, the development allowance provides a deduction equal to 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure in the first year that the plant is used or installed ready for use.

They certainly do not like the overall approach represented by the original Act but, as I understand it, they have not expressed opposition to these amendments, except to the extent that they seem to be saying that, if the amendments enable more projects to qualify, that represents a higher level of government intervention in investment decisions. They say they are against that.

         This measure and the principal Act are part of a package of measures set out in the One Nation statement designed to improve this country's economic fortunes. Part of that package was a major boost to the spending on public infrastructure. I note that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was critical of that. I think that criticism is misplaced. I think there is a growing body of evidence in the international economic literature that under-investment in public infrastructure is a false economy and exacts a significant toll in terms of overall growth in economic productivity.

The honourable member for Curtin made reference to this being an approach involving picking winners. I do not think that is a reasonable description. We are not identifying particular industry sectors. We are not purporting to make judgments as to the overall prospects of major investment projects. We are doing something far more limited: we are applying a competitiveness test to see whether we have best practice, on a world standard, in labour management relations and to see whether we have efficient industries involved in the provision of inputs. It is much more limited than some generalised attempt to pick winners. I think that characterisation is wrong.

What we are seeking to do is, on the one hand, to secure the bringing forward of major investment decisions, but also, in the process, to capitalise some change in overall culture and practice in Australian industry. As a way of doing that, I think this is a pretty reasonable approach.

         The allowance is targeted towards the stimulation of investment in large projects which can satisfy the DAA that they are world competitive and that the environment within which they operate is also competitive. Projects which are heavily assisted are specifically excluded from eligibility. That reflects the approach of this Government of moving to a lower tariff environment and a less protected environment than the one we have now, albeit not going to the zero or negligible protection levels favoured by the Opposition.

         In that context, each applicant must satisfy the DAA that the project does not have a nominal or effective rate of assistance—taking the lower figure—exceeding 10 per cent. These measures of assistance will be calculated separately for each project, taking into account all assistance received by the project from all levels of government in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Industry Commission to calculate assistance. There are a number of key dates in the legislation, the most immediately pressing of which is 1 January 1993, before which date all applications must have been received by the DAA if they are to be considered. I hope that point clears up the degree of confusion that might exist in the industry about the need for individual projects to satisfy that test in respect of not being heavily protected.

         —This is the twenty-fifth occasion on which I have been in this Parliament when we have debated a Budget. On the first night I was a member of this Parliament William McMahon brought in the 1967 Budget. For the sake of memory I went back and read that speech a few weeks ago. One has to say that the activities of this Parliament have changed quite considerably during that period. For instance, the Budget mentioned a massive increase in health expenditure at that time of $35m that year. It did not mention education because the Commonwealth had no role in education, other than a couple of the 1950 bribes which were still in continuance—science blocks and school libraries—which won Menzies an election.

         It was interesting that at that time, 18 years after the conservative parties had come into office, one of the major promises they had made in 1949 and fulfilled in 1950 to introduce child endowment for the first child had just seen its first change. The Government changed the five shillings to 50c, with the change to decimal currency, but there was never a change in the amount of money. I make those points because I think it is important that the change that has taken place over a relatively short period in our history in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States be emphasised.

         Until the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972 the Commonwealth largely remained an adjunct to the community in Australia rather than part of it. Its activities were peripheral to the day-to-day life of ordinary Australians. It is significant that the major issues Gough Whitlam put forward when he was the Leader of the Opposition were things such as sewering the suburbs. I can imagine some of our founding fathers turning in their graves at the thought. There were 600,000 Australians who had been let down by State governments, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, living in half and full houses without such basic community amenities.

         Much of that has changed but so has the Commonwealth itself. This Parliament now controls and is responsible for—and, no matter what the Opposition may like to think, is going to stay responsible for—the major activities of communities in Australia. The attempts to withdraw from that are the most dangerous aspects of the Opposition's policies today. We have gone from the period where William McMahon stood up at the table in the old House with galleries full of pensioners and told them that there was no money in the Budget for a rise in pensions this year. I am sure the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) will remember that. He will also remember that a person whom I am sure he supported at the time, John Gorton, was the Prime Minister. When William McMahon became Prime Minister, the first thing he did was give them 50c. It was the only highlight of his first speech as Prime Minister.

         At the end of the period of the Whitlam Government, the whole relationship had changed. So had the way the Parliament was conducted, and I have to say we have not changed our procedures sufficiently to deal with the workload we now have. We still use the forms, with more members and less time, that we used in 1900. We adopted the Westminster system. We have not changed it to meet Australians' needs; we have not changed it at all. We still debate everything in the chamber, which is unnecessary. Basically, because of that, we have abdicated our responsibility as a House of Parliament to look at legislation. It has to do with the comfort of members on both sides.

         I have been 12 years in government and 13 years in opposition. In that time I have heard 12 years of Liberal oppositions and 13 years of Labor oppositions all complain that they are not getting sufficient time and sufficient opportunity to contribute. But not one of them was prepared to make one single alteration to the procedures to facilitate any change. I have to say Prime Ministers are the worst. They are all the same, if I might say so. It does not matter where they come from. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has advocated change in this Parliament but the only change he has significantly put forward is televising Parliament. I cannot see how that has done anyone any good. I do not think those opposite have a great record on reform.

         The Fightback package is not a tax package and the GST is not a tax package. They are regressive and they take us back to a period nearly 100 years ago when the distinction between those people in our society was great and conflict was even greater. It is 100 years ago since we had the shearers strikes. It is all right to brush that off because that was the past, but attitudes have not changed greatly. The greed amongst some of the people in our community, who see someone being supported because they are less well-off than they are as an imposition on their rights and an imposition on them personally, is still there and it is not far below the surface.

         Some of the extremist organisations of the Right in this country are as bad as any of the organisations we have had which have been much maligned in this Parliament over the years. I suppose there is a problem in that if one is of the Left, which claims to represent a broader section of the community—that section which does not have wealth and does not have privilege—then what one is saying is evil and wrong; but if one is of the Right and seeks the proper privilege then what one is saying is correct. This is an anecdote but it is true:  the only member ever to get 28 days suspension in this Parliament was suspended for responding to someone who called him a Bolshevik by calling him a Hun lover. The honourable member who called the other member a Bolshevik was not even asked to withdraw; such are the standards which we apply to everything.

It has not been tried in the United States but follows the general principles of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, bringing that country to its knees.

         There is no evidence in our history that private entrepreneurs have built structures in Australia which are lasting, which are successful and which are sound. There are some instances but there is a very poor history of private entrepreneurs going out and doing things in this country. Our managers have only been good on rare occasions. We now talk about the recession; we talk about foreign debt; and we blame governments—naturally. It might be of interest to the House to examine this point: which bank was the most successful in riding out that recession in Australia?  The Commonwealth Bank. Which bank did worst?

         I want to make one or two comments on how farcical Fightback is. The National Party has had some problems since I have been here. Its leadership has gone from John McEwen, who I think most would look upon as a `great', to Doug Anthony—it changed its name to the National Party because it was starting to get a bit worried at that stage—then to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), whom the Party decided to throw out. I think he was the first leader it has thrown out in living memory. It then went to a leader who lost his seat, which does not say much for his electoral standing, and now we have the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) who said the other day that the GST can be avoided if one grows vegetables. That cannot be done unless one eats them all because, under the GST, barter is involved. If there are two pensioners, and one grows cabbages and has more than he can eat, if he hands them over the fence to his neighbour and gets a few lemons, they both have to put in a tax form because that is barter trade.

         —That is the type of thing we are talking about—form filling by everyone in Australia. I heard someone earlier in the day talk about hidden taxes; he was talking about sales tax. There have been 40 years of Liberal governments in this Parliament—conservative governments—during the period sales tax has been in operation, and they have expanded it, not reduced it at any stage. Hidden taxes are the ones that people are not told about and do not know about. I will go back to one of our former leaders and the sorts of tax promises we have heard, and will continue to hear, from those who sit opposite. In 1975, Malcolm Fraser had just assumed leadership of the Liberal Party. Those opposite have gone so far to the right now that they claim he is a Labor member and a leftie, but I can assure them that we still look upon him as extreme right. Malcolm Fraser told us that there would be no more taxation by stealth. I heard that phrase in the last week, `No more taxation by stealth'.

The conservative parties in this House had legislated before the election to index the tax brackets. They fulfilled Malcolm's promise after the Budget, during the tax year, to apply for the next tax year. Then the Australian Taxation Office spent half a million dollars on overtime, answering telephones because the Liberal ads told people to ring up the Tax Office and find out what the tax savings would be.

Honourable members may remember that in that election we promised to abolish payroll tax and we were howled down about people paying personal income tax. What had we done?

Some of us still have a copy of the documents that passed between the Commissioner of Taxation and the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), asking the Treasurer to bring in legislation. It includes some of the minutes of Liberal Party committees. The Liberal Party was desperately trying to stall any action. For two years the Commissioner wrote letters talking about the bleeding of the tax system by the most blatant cheating that had ever gone on in this country—$1 billion worth of tax. The report on the straw companies is very thick. There are letters from the Commissioner of Taxation pleading with the then Treasurer and the Fraser Government to fix up the tax legislation so that it could be applied and the tax system could become honest.

         As I have only a short period left in which to speak, I must say that I have been here for 25 years and I arrived at a time when the coalition had been in office for 18 years. It had been 16 years since it had paid its way in its budgetary affairs, despite some very good years in Australia. There were 18 consecutive failures to bring in a surplus. The coalition governments had borrowed in every Budget to finance their affairs. They had not brought in a balanced Budget since 1951 in the wool boom. It would have been pretty hard not to have balanced the Budget that year. As a matter of fact, if the government had not balanced the Budget that year, it would have needed an investigation to see how much it had taken out for itself. So from 1951 until today not one coalition government has had the economic capacity, the nous or the commitment to bring in one balanced Budget. For the sake of those in the National Party, I will say that one of the first things that I had to do out in the bush was to go around and explain to farmers why they had to be paid under the tree pull scheme to pull out trees that the then Country Party had subsidised—

         —I would like to bring forward a ludicrous situation that makes a sham of the rhetoric we hear in this place from many honourable members who express concern about the maintenance of efficient Australian industry. It was Australia's CSIRO that led the world in developing technology known as counter current extraction which could obtain an extract from citrus fruit peel that would otherwise have gone to waste. Considerable public funds went into the research and development of this, and into subsequent efforts to commercialise it.

         The National Food Authority will be aware that it is possible, with CCE, to extract from that part of the citrus fruit known as peel a peel extract. That product, known as diffusion extracted juice, closely resembles the juice which is extracted from the flesh of the fruit. In fact, the NFA's predecessor came to the view that orange peel extract, as it was decided to call it, was not only a wholesome and nutritious product but also varied little from orange juice in chemical and nutritional make-up. Nevertheless, for reasons arising from no more than perceptions of customer opinion, the NFA's predecessor came to the view that the products made from the endocarp only, or from the exocarp and mesocarp only, were different, so different that in terms of food regulation one was juice and the other was not for purposes of use in fruit drinks and cordials. There is no evidence in the official minutes of the NFA's predecessor as to the views or opinions of consumers on this matter, although some opinions as to what they might be are recorded. There is also no evidence that the NFA's predecessor ever sought such views or commissioned any surveys on its own account.

         The NFA's predecessor considered the effects of mixing orange peel extract and orange juice in fruit drinks, cordials and soft drinks. On the one hand it was established that, because the chemical composition of both products was very similar, the end product was indistinguishable from orange juice. On the other hand, however, it was apparently felt that such mixing would be adulteration and therefore deceptive. It was, however, a deception so undetectable that there was no Australian laboratory test capable of finding it. In an effort to detect the undetectable, the very same CSIRO which developed the original technology has now been asked to develop an effective test.

         In the course of its deliberations, the NFA's predecessor considered the situation of limes. It appears that, because lime juice has traditionally been made from the whole fruit, it was decided that lime juice should be exempted from the ban that applies to all other citrus peel extract. It is recognised that lime juice has been made for a long time before that, peel and all.

         The point is that the public has been no more aware or unaware of this practice in the case of that fruit, whether from limes or from any other citrus. Such adulteration or deception as may be thought to arise is at best theoretical. It is based on a view of consumers interested in how a product was produced, rather than what it is. At the same time, the Australian citrus industry makes the present application for the authorisation of the use of fruit juice peel in fruit drinks and related products and not for its inclusion in fruit juice. As well, the proposal is that fruit peel juice should be declared as an ingredient on the label.

Industry statistics indicate that 32,816,000 litres of single strength juice, or 64,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, will have to be found to replace citrus peel juice in products such as cordial, soft drinks and fruit drinks if the intended amendment comes into effect.

        The plan does respond to earlier recommendations of the Industries Commission, but the strategies to be implemented are far different to the proposals put forward in the I.C. Report.

        The decision of the Government should be welcomed by all of us in the industry in N.S.W.

These proposals will drive value-adding of dairy products on the export market as well as the domestic market, and dairy companies such as Norco Co-operative, that are strongly involved in value-adding, will be well placed for the future.

        I would very much like to point out to the dairy farmers on the north coast certain aspects of the impact of the GST. I make reference to an article in the journal of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science which was published in May 1992. The article I am referring to was written by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd). In particular, I point to the financial burden that the GST will place on this industry, using the very figures that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has actually published—so I guess they must be right.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The example that the Deputy Leader uses is a dairy farm which produces something like 380,000 litres of milk a year. On his own figures, that particular dairy farm would be sending to the Taxation Commissioner, if the coalition were ever to introduce a GST, in excess of $6,000 just in goods and services tax.

         This particular dairy farm would probably not be a good example for north coast dairy farmers, because of some of the deductions that would be allowed. In any farming business, the deductions allowed are those which the farmer would outlay and  which would have a GST on them. Whether this particular example is high or low, does not stop the farmer paying a GST.

If the deductions were low, he would still be paying a GST on his profit, because the GST that he pays out comes in on the income that he receives. He gets a rebate on his deductions.

         —With Australia's recession being the most severe since the 1930s, there has been a re-emergence of a protectionist sentiment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating)—the then Treasurer—said in this House on 15 May 1991:

        These are the clear statements of Prime Minister Keating. The interventionists cannot give Australia an alternative model to free trade.

         I have examined some of the shifts in Victoria in employment patterns over the last three years. Clothing and footwear industries employed 39,500 in May 1989. Three years later, that figure had dropped to 31,200. The Industry Commission estimates that the average effective rate of assistance to this sector in June 1989 was 171 per cent. By June 1991, the effective rate of assistance had increased to 176 per cent.

         Employment in the motor vehicle and parts sector had declined from 48,800 in 1989 to 37,000 in 1992, whereas there was a fall in effective protection levels from 72 per cent to 60 per cent. Yet the unprotected motor trades sector now only employs 57,000 compared with 62,000 two years ago. Job losses in the unprotected construction industry have hit even harder. There are now only 121,000 employees in the construction industry in Victoria, as against 160,000 in 1989.

         If job losses are largely the fault of tariff reductions, why has the construction industry suffered so heinously and so badly. The boom and bust mentality of the 1980s under the Victorian Labor Government ensured that, when the bust hit Victoria, jobs totally unrelated to tariff walls were lost.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Some occupations in Victoria have actually recorded increases in employment over the last three years. The glass sector, for instance, increased employment from 2,400 to 3,100. It is protected to a level of only one per cent. Employment rose in the furniture and mattresses industries from 15,500 to 18,400—a gain of 20 per cent. Those industries operate with protection levels of between one and 4 per cent. They managed to increase employment during a recession, and with heightened import competition.

Either the recession or a lack of capital investment over the past 40 years are the most important factors in any job losses, rather than any lowering of tariff protection.

        There is a future for manufacturing industry in Victoria. The car industry will continue as a force, provided it keeps on achieving productivity gains.

          Today we have been involved in a debate that somewhat focused on subsidies, particularly the subsidies that we see flowing, as a result of EEP, into what are traditional markets for Australian wheat. It is true that Australian primary producers only survive now by using the best techniques they have available to them. In fact, the Kinsey report into agriculture in South Australia asked the very fundamental question: why is it that the best sheep graziers in the Pinnaroo area of South Australia achieve a lambing rate of 98 per cent, when the average lambing rate is only 68 per cent? They discovered that, for very little additional input, it is possible for a farmer to lift the lambing rate from 68 per cent to 98 per cent and make a real contribution to Australia's export income.

          I use that as a backdrop to my remarks tonight because I want to focus the attention of the House on one primary industry which, with very little additional input, has a dramatic opportunity to raise its productivity base, and that is the chicken industry in South Australia. One of the companies in my electorate, Imloson Pty Ltd, which runs a hatchery at Bethel just north of Gawler, had sought permission from AQIS to import chickens from a European destination—Isabrown chickens. AQIS gave Imloson permission on the condition that it accepted a secondary quarantine period for these imports.

          Imloson went ahead with the import. It brought these Isabrown eggs in and went ahead with the hatching program. Meanwhile, unknown to Imloson, AQIS had also commissioned a Dr Snowdon to check out the whole quarantine procedure that applied to the chicken industry. Dr Snowdon handed down a report which indicated that EDS, the egg drop syndrome—the one thing that AQIS would be most nervous about with the import of Isabrown chickens—was no longer, in Dr Snowdon's assessment, something that Australia should be concerned about on an import basis, particularly as EDS was already present in Australia and therefore did not pose any greater threat to the Australian chicken industry. Imloson, having brought in the Isabrown chickens and holding them in quarantine, principally because of the perceived earlier EDS threat, sought permission from AQIS, first, to move the birds to an alternative sight—and permission was granted—and, secondly, to lift this quarantine protocol as EDS was no longer seen to be a problem. AQIS refused to lift this protocol.

          The picture becomes even more complicated when we discover that, because of the shortage of egg pulp in Australia, there is a proposal to import egg pulp from New Zealand, and under discussion paper CQO(A) 112/92 it has been agreed that EDS is not of quarantine significance. What I want to know is why it is that AQIS still insists on Imloson meeting all of the quarantine protocols that were originally laid down, even though AQIS clearly no longer saw EDS as a problem.

          These quarantine protocols are costing Imloson thousands of dollars. That is no exaggeration. There are opportunities for Imloson to move into additional job creation if they could free the birds currently held under protocol, since they no longer pose a threat to the chicken industry. Imloson has not been critical of AQIS. It suspects that AQIS is already being lobbied by its major competitors to oblige AQIS to stand by the protocols. But the fact remains that what could be an even more efficient industry is being frustrated by these present AQIS regulations which, under the eye of AQIS, have already been seen as being excessive. The import of egg pulp and the recommendations made in Dr Snowdon's report would indicate that there is no reason why EDS should continue to be a quarantine problem.

         —Tonight I rise to express concern at events that have transpired in my home State, where the Speaker of the Tasmanian Parliament has foreshadowed draconian bans on the right of the public to attend the Tasmanian Parliament. What has occurred is that, in response to a number of demonstrations from building workers who are facing involuntary retrenchments, the Speaker has closed the galleries and said that for substantial periods—for at least a full day after any clearing of the gallery—the public will not be admitted to the Speaker's galleries to witness the debates in the State Parliament. Not merely those who have taken part in demonstrations have been excluded, but any member of the public will be excluded unless they have a prearranged appointment with a member.

         The Speaker's lockout at the Parliament shows a total contempt for the basic rights of all Tasmanians and follows a downward spiral by the State Government, which has seen events move towards greater polarisation of the society. Since the Liberals came to government in Tasmania, we have seen guard dogs and hired muscle used during the APPM dispute, legislation to stop people demonstrating on Crown land, picketers arrested at the Hobart waterfront and members of the public now being effectively locked out of their own Parliament.

         —I am sorry, the First World War. The only defence that has thus far been made of the decision of the Tasmanian Government to exclude the public from attendance at the Parliament has come from Michael Hodgman, QC, now a State member. I do not normally descend to a cheap shot at my predecessor. He did have, at one stage, a very substantial reputation as a man who might make a mark on the national scene. But, over time, I think his lack of self-respect for the issues that he pursued led him to become a caricature of his former self.

         As his descent from importance has occurred, his volume has grown more strident and the substance of what he says less connected with reality.

        (3) The Department's review strategy for a number of years has been aimed at identifying groups of pensioners where there is a risk of incorrect payments being made. World War I veterans were selected as a payment group requiring special attention during a review undertaken 4-5 years ago of a sample of New South Wales pensioners. As the review did not highlight any incorrect payments being made, it was considered that there was no need to investigate World War I veterans, as a specific risk group, on an ongoing basis.

        However, a number of these veterans would be included in the selection of pensioners whose entitlements are to be reassessed or affirmed during the other review activities undertaken by the Department. These activities include annual review of assets and rent verification. Particular categories of pensioners are reviewed on a regular basis where the Department is aware that income or assets may vary. Also, groups of pensioners are selected for review on an ad hoc basis to determine whether correct entitlements are being paid. World War I veterans would be included in each of these groups.
