The President and I did not wish for this work element to proceed until our entrances had been completed. The turnstiles will operate in a free-spin mode for the time being. The timings for the implementation of the access control requiring passes is yet to be determined, but I'll keep members informed as we go. </span>

The Deputy Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Road safety remains a priority for the Australian Government and we are committed to reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your idea regarding the use of sound detection software in mobile phones and mobile devices. The Deputy Prime Minister acknowledges your petition and shares your concerns about the potential sources of distraction for drivers such as mobile phones and mobile devices. In recent years, police and state and territory road safety ministers have raised particular concerns about the rapid increase in the use of mobile phones in vehicles among the general population, including their use for purposes unrelated to driving.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2018 the Transport and Infrastructure Council (the Council) acknowledged the need for all levels of government to do more to address deaths and injuries on our roads and endorsed the new National Road Safety Action Plan for 2018-2020 (Action Plan). The Council includes the Government, state, territory and New Zealand ministers with responsibility for transport and infrastructure issues, as well as the Australian Local Government Association. The Council also supported a nationally coordinated project to develop best practice in addressing driver distraction particularly from mobile phones. Further information is available at www,transportinfrastructurecouncil.gov.au/communique.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Action Plan calls on governments to work together to develop a holistic strategy to reduce driver distraction, considering enforcement, new and emerging technology and refining legislation. Further information about the Action Plan is available at www.roadsafety.gov.au/action-plan/2018-2020</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2017 the Government initiated an Inquiry into the National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) 2011-2020 and appointed two independent experts to look closely at the evidence and provide advice on how governments can work together to take stronger and more effective actions to enhance road safety and reduce road trauma.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 12 September 2018, the Deputy Prime Minister welcomed the release of the NRSS Inquiry report. The Government will be carefully considering the recommendations of the report, which cover a wide range of areas including road safety leadership, resourcing, performance monitoring and innovative technology. The Deputy Prime Minister will be considering a range of proposals as part of the Government's response to the Inquiry. The Government will also conduct a new review of National Road Safety Governance, which was one of the recommendations of the NRSS Inquiry report. Further information about the Inquiry and the national approach to road safety is available at www.roadsafety.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 10 September 2019, regarding a petition (EN0229) presented to the House of Representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition calls for those parliamentarians, following rulings by the High Court, acting as the Court of Disputed Returns, found as being ineligible to serve in the Australian Parliament to repay all monies received in their role and for their pensions to be cancelled.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with previous cases where the High Court has ruled a parliamentarian ineligible, consideration was given to the potential debt to the Commonwealth that arises from past payment of salaries and allowances, and other costs of office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Finance, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority and the Department of the House of Representatives (for Members of the House) or Department of the Senate (for Senators) determined the appropriate action regarding each debt, pursuant to requirements in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 </span>(the PGPA Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Like everyone else who owes a debt to the Commonwealth, those former parliamentarians could apply for a debt waiver under section 63(1) of the PGPA Act. During the last parliament, waivers were recommended by independent officials and granted in particular cases because it was difficult for individuals to know at the time of nomination, based on how the law was previously understood, that they were ineligible. The relevant individuals were found to have performed public duties in good faith</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While superannuation details of individual cases cannot be provided, it is a matter of public record that the individuals involved entered parliament after the new superannuation scheme came into effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result, none of these individuals would be entitled to a defined benefit pension from the Commonwealth in respect of their parliamentary service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letters of 5 and 20 August 2019 regarding petitions EN0230 and EN0239 respectively, requesting that an audit of compliance with s 44 of the Constitution be conducted. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware that this petition was originally presented on 15 August 2017, and that the Petitions Committee has not received a response to the referral of the petition to my predecessor. My department's searches indicate this correspondence was marked for no further action, in error. I apologise for the error, and the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the date the petition was initially presented, the legislative framework for Commonwealth elections has changed. Recently, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Electoral Legislation Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2019 </span>was enacted. That Act changed, among other things, the candidate nominations process for elections by requiring prospective candidates for an election to complete a qualification checklist to demonstrate eligibility under s 44 of the Constitution. Additional documents are also required, in certain circumstances, to support claims made in the qualification checklist submitted with the nomination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The qualification checklist and any supporting documents provided with the checklist are published on the Australian Electoral Commission's website as soon as practicable from the declaration of nominations, until 40 days after the return of the writs. That is, until a petition disputing the election can no longer be filed under Part XXII of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. </span>After the return of the writs for the election, checklists and additional documentation for successful candidates (those elected as Senators or members of the House of Representatives) will be tabled in Parliament. I note that the requirements in the Act will apply to future elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Resolutions were agreed in the House of Representatives on 4 December 2017 and the Senate on 13 November 2017 requiring parliamentarians to disclose information relating to their citizenship. Further, and in accordance with resolutions of the House of Representatives and the Senate on 4 April 2019 and 3 April 2019 respectively, the current Register of Members' qualifications and Register of Senators' qualifications under sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution were established and are published.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 5 August 2019, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Tax on AlcoholâPetition number; EN0250. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As beer is already taxed at rates significantly lower than other forms of alcohol, such as spirits and ready-to-drink (RID) beverages, standardising alcohol taxes across all alcohol products would likely increase prices of most beer and wine, and reduce prices of spirits and RTDs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since this petition was received, the Australian Government has implemented a number of measures to level the playing field for craft brewers. From 1 July 2019, the draught beer concessional rates were extended to beer stored in containers between eight and 48 litres, making them accessible to craft brewers who use smaller kegs. In addition, the excise refund scheme cap for brewers and distillers was increased from $30,000 to $100,000. The excise refund scheme allows brewers and distillers to claim 60 per cent of the excise they have paid up to the cap per financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More generally, the Government is backing small and medium-sized businesses through tax relief and by increasing and expanding access to the instant asset write-off. The Government has increased the instant asset write-off threshold to $30,000 and expanded access to medium-sized businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50 million until 30 June 2020. The threshold applies on a per asset basis, so eligible businesses can instantly write off multiple assets. The Government's changes ensure that more businesses continue to benefit from the instant asset write-off as they grow, supporting them to invest in assets and build their business.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien, </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 5 August 2019, concerning Standing Committee on PetitionsâPetition no EN0399âbaby formula exports. My sincere apologies for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the regulatory oversight of Australian made dairy products exported from Australia in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control Act 1982 </span>and its subordinate legislation. In line with this legislation, all shipments of Australian made infant formula exported in volumes of greater than ten kilograms per individual consignment must meet strict manufacturing and export requirements, and must be issued with a permit by my department prior to export.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department currently believes the ten kilogram limit in place is suitable to control the volume of legally exported Australian made infant formula. As part of the government's current review of export legislation, due for implementation 2021, the department will seek views from industry and key stakeholders regarding the appropriateness of the current legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many popular infant formula brands for sale in Australia such as A2, Karricare and Aptimal, which are currently being purchased off the shelf and subsequently exported, are not Australian made and therefore fall outside the remit of the department. While the department is not responsible for regulating the export of products not manufactured in Australia, officers have worked closely with a number of key stakeholders including the larger supermarket chains, the Infant Nutritional Council of Australia, Dairy Australia and local manufacturers, to ensure there remains sufficient supply and availability of infant formula for Australian parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Noting Australian consumer concerns about this practice, and as a result of collaborative discussions, I understand supermarkets continue to work with their suppliers regarding stock levels and are enforcing limits on individual purchases. I also understand several companies have made their products available online to ensure supply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department continues to work collaboratively with cross border agencies to investigate allegations around exports of dairy products, including infant formula to China. The penalties in place under export legislation are considerable and where appropriate, include financial and penal provisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The issue of infant formula availability and suitable controls over the export of Australian made dairy products is a challenging issue. 1 believe both industry and the government share a common goal of providing a safe and high quality product for our domestic and international markets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information about the export of infant formula can be found on the department's website http://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/controlled-goods/dairy, or by contacting Mr Shayne Daniels, Director of the Dairy Exports program from the department.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to write to me on this issue.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter to the Minister for the Environment, the Hon Sussan Ley MP, concerning petition EN0614 on increasing Australia's uptake of solar energy. I am responding as the responsible Minister.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Liberal National Government, Australia has recorded the highest per capita level of investment in renewable energy in the world, and we have now met the Renewable Energy Target ahead of schedule. According to the most recent statistics, 5 per cent of Australia's total electricity generation was from solar last year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Government's small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme has encouraged significant new small-scale renewable energy supply by helping households and businesses to install rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and solar hot water systems. As at 30 June 2019, more than 2.1 million rooftop solar PV panels and 1.1 million solar water heater systems had been installed under the scheme. Australia has the world's highest level of uptake of household solar panels, with one in five Australian households now having solar panels on their roof.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 5 August 2019 to the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon Michael Sukkar MP, regarding the petition EN0755 about stopping planned obsolescence and reducing e-waste. Your letter has been referred to me for response as Minister for the Environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2018, all of Australia's environment ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government Association set a unified direction for waste by agreeing to a new National Waste Policy. The Policy identifies waste avoidance as a priority. It encourages efficient use, reuse and repair, and calls for products to be designed so that waste is minimised, that they are made to last and can be repaired, and the materials that are used to manufacture products are easily recovered for recycling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Waste Policy also identifies product stewardship as a priority. This includes development and implementation of partnerships across government and business to ensure that the negative impacts of products are minimised, waste is avoided, and reuse, repair and recycling of products is maximised throughout their life cycle. All governments are now developing an Action Plan to implement the Policy, which will be considered at the next Meeting of Environment Ministers in November this year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support these objectives, the Government has committed $167 million to an Australian Recycling Investment Plan. This Plan includes $20 million for a new Product Stewardship Investment Fund to accelerate work on new industry-led recycling schemes, including electrical and electronic products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This new Fund will build on the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme set up by the Australian Government under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Product Stewardship Act 2011. </span>This scheme works to provide households and small businesses with access to industry-funded collection and recycling services for televisions and computers, printers and computer parts. Since 2011, more than 1800 e-waste collection spots have been created and more than 230,000 tonnes of TV and computer waste has been collected. This scheme has diverted hazardous materials away from landfill and enabled the reuse of valuable resources contained in e-waste.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, consumer affairs ministers from Australia and New Zealand agreed at a Consumer Affairs Forum on 30 August 2019 to consider laws to boost people's ability to repair their phones and other electronic goods. This agreement reflects a global movement towards a 'right to repair', which has grown in response to concerns about increasing amounts of waste going to landfill and design concepts like planned obsolescence.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the letter of 5 April 2019 from Mrs Lucy Wicks, MP, the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning petition number EN0761âShortage of GPs in rural, remote and regional locations - Stronger Rural Health Strategy (Strategy). I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy is a $550 million investment over five years that will deliver lasting improvements, including around 3,000 additional specialist GPs over the next ten years. The package of measures has been carefully crafted to influence change in an integrated way. it also balances initiatives that will come to fruition in the longer term with others offering more immediate benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy will improve the capacity, quality, distribution and mix of our primary care workforce through a range of mechanisms that include: rural-based medical training (allowing medical students to undertake a majority of their training in rural settings); general practice training arrangements; increased Medicare benefits; financial incentives; reformed bonding arrangements; and Australia's skilled migration program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government appreciates the concern about the possible impact of the cessation of the Rural Other Medical Practitioners (ROMPs) Program, given that many GPs servicing rural areas are non-vocationally recognised. The Strategy ensures, however, that any impact will be marginal and outweighed by the benefits of other measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The unstructured ROMPs Program had the perverse effect of contributing to rural communities having less access to fully qualified GPs. New support programs conducted by the two general practice colleges will promote more timely and successful Fellowship outcomes. Both programs target regional, rural and remote areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Government funding will subsidise up to 5,000 doctors to participate on either the Independent Pathway offered by the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine or the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' new Practice Experience Program (PEP). These doctors will have access to the higher Medicare rebates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitional arrangements will minimise any disruption. About 2,500 existing ROMPs participants are guaranteed access to the higher Medicare rebates until 30 June 2023, providing they continue to meet program guidelines. Further, while the new PEP comes fully on stream, doctors who pass an entrance test will be placed on a waiting list giving immediate access to the higher rebates.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 6 August 2019 concerning petition EN0811 which relates to Lifetime Health Cover (LHC). The Australian Government remains committed to a sustainable private health sector and LHC is an important measure to promote this outcome.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">LHC was introduced in 2000, to encourage people to purchase private insurance for hospital cover earlier in life and to maintain this cover. This helps alleviate the pressure on private health insurance premiums that would be caused by younger and lower risk members either never getting or dropping private health insurance. This would leave an increasingly high risk and costly pool of privately insured people, and result in increased premiums for all policy holders. Data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority shows that LHC has been very effective in bringing people into private health insurance at an earlier age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a private health insurance hospital policy is not purchased within the 'required period' of time, the LHC loading (at a rate of two per cent for every year you are over the age of 30) is applied and remains in place for a continuous 10 year period, after which time the loading is removed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People have a choice about whether to use the public or private systems according to their own circumstances. Private health insurance is not compulsory. All Australian residents, regardless of whether they hold private health insurance, are eligible to be treated free of charge as public patients under Medicare.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 February 2019 originally to directed to the Treasurer concerning petition number EN0814, for a lower personal income tax rate for fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a progressive personal income tax system, meaning people with higher taxable incomes pay more tax as a proportion of their income than people on lower incomes. This is based on the principle that each person should contribute to the cost of government services according to his or her ability to pay.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The amount of income tax that each individual pays on their taxable income is based on the marginal rates and thresholds, as well as any offsets or levies that they may be eligible for that either reduce or increase tax payable. A key principle of the Australian tax system is horizontal equity, meaning that taxpayers in similar circumstances will be treated in a similar way. For this reason, it would be unfair to impose a lower rate of income tax on FIFO workers compared with workers in other occupations or sectors of the economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has delivered further tax relief for hard-working Australians, including FIFO workers, as announced in the 2019-20 Budget. The additional tax relief is now law and will deliver a further $158 billion in tax relief by enhancing the Personal Income Tax Plan first announced in the 2018-19 Budget. As a result, low- and middle-income earners will keep more of what they earn. The Government's tax relief measures will help to support consumption growth, which will be good for the economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has enhanced the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) by increasing the base offset from $200 to $255 and the maximum benefit from $530 to $1,080. This provides tax relief of up to $1,080 for singles, or up to $2,160 for dual income families. The offset is available for the 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 income years. The enhanced LMITO will assist over 10 million Australians, with about 4.5 million taxpayers with incomes between $48,000 and $90,000 receiving the full benefit for 2018-19. Around 2.3 million Australians with taxable incomes less than $37,000 will receive an offset of up to $255.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This builds on the increase to the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, which took effect from 1 July 2018. Eligible individuals would have already received this tax relief for the 2018-19 income year through pay-as-you-go withholding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will replace the LMITO from 1 July 2022 through changes to income tax thresholds and the Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) which will lock in the benefits of LMITO. The top threshold of the 19 per cent tax bracket will increase from $37,000 to $45,000 and the maximum amount of LITO will increase from $445 to $700. At the same time, the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent tax bracket will increase from $90,000 to $120,000 preventing around 1.8 million taxpayers from entering the 37 per cent tax bracket in 2022-23.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2024 the Government has legislated structural reforms to the tax system, abolishing the 37 per cent tax bracket completely and reducing the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At its completion in 2024-25, the enhanced Personal Income Tax Plan will deliver a simpler tax system with only three tax rates. Australians earning between $45,000 and $200,000 will face a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent. A projected 94 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of no higher than 30 per cent.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Q Fever</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the letter of 18 February 2019 from the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Mrs Lucy Wicks MP, concerning petition EN0815 regarding funding for a National Q Fever Vaccination Program and support to develop a next generation Q fever vaccine. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Q fever is a potentially serious disease and vaccination remains the best form of protection. The Australian Government subsidises Q fever vaccine production and supply to the Australian market through substantial funding to the only global manufacturer, Seqirus Australia Pty Ltd (Seqirus). This funding ensures those at a high risk of Q fever have access to a vaccine. Australia is the only country in the world that routinely uses the Q fever vaccine as part of its prevention efforts. The contract with Seqirus provides approximately $42 million per year in funding to ensure supply of Q fever vaccine, antivenoms and pandemic influenza vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Current funding arrangements will ensure all Australians have access to the Qfever skin test and vaccine until 2024. Without this government support, Seqirus would not produce these products, as they are not commercially viable due to the low quantities purchased.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no standardised price for the Q fever vaccine as it is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The cost to the consumer will vary depending on where the vaccine is administered, for example, whether provided through the public or private system, or through an occupational vaccination program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of vaccination and provides free vaccines to eligible cohorts through the National Immunisation Program (NIP). Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953, </span>the Government cannot consider funding a vaccine on the NIP unless it has been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). To date, the PBAC has not received a submission for Q-Vax from Seqirus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a commercial entity, Seqirus would need to consider a number of clinical, financial and supply factors in making an application to the PBAC for listing Q-Vax on the NIP or the PBS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmaceutical companies are private businesses that make their own decisions about the pricing of their medicines and whether they will market them exclusively on the private market or apply for subsidisation through the PBS or the NIP. Should Seqirus make an application to the PBAC in seeking to list 0-Vax on the PBS and the P8AC makes a recommendation in favour of this, the Government will list the medicine as a matter of priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports the critical role of health and medical research in improving health outcomes and recognises the significant burden that diseases such as Cifever can place on individuals, their families and the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides grants of financial assistance to support health and medical research in improving the health and wellbeing of Australians though the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF). The MRFF was established to provide a sustainable source of funding for vital medical research over the medium to long term. Investment decisions are guided by the independent Australian Medical Research Advisory Board, based on priorities determined through extensive community and sector consultation. Importantly, the MRFF is additional and complementary to the National Health and Medical Research Council, the point of difference being the MRFF's focus on translational research.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 5 August 2019, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning the introduction of a Bank Star RatingâPetition number: EN0839. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can inform you that the Australian Government is taking action to empower Australians to make better choices when purchasing financial products. On 9 May 2018, the Government introduced legislation to enable Open Banking in Australia. Open Banking will require banks to grant open access to data on the products they offer, while giving customers the ability to direct their bank to securely share their banking data with whom they choose. This should lead to the development of comparison services able to provide tailored recommendations. This will also dramatically simplify the choices consumers face, and enable them to find better products to suit their needs. The ability to transfer data will also help to overcome the 'hassle factor' that sees customers stick with their current provider despite more competitive deals elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the long term success of the regime, a phased implementation has been adopted. From 1 July 2019, the Big Four Banks have been required to publicly share product data about credit and debit cards, deposit accounts and transaction accounts. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) and CSIRO's Data 61 will also launch a pilot program to test the performance, reliability and security of the Open Banking system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes its primary advice on climate science from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). This advice aligns with information provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other organisations, such as the Australian Academy of Science, the World Meteorological Organization, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These world leading scientific organisations have found that the Earth's climate is changing and humans are primarily responsible. This finding is informed by long-term observations of air temperatures, the heat content of the ocean, changes to glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If required, Commonwealth science agencies such as the BoM and the CSIRO could provide information on proposed interventions in the climate system, often referred to as `geoengineering.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Paris Agreement the Government has committed to reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. While Australia is only responsible for 1.3 per cent of global emissions, countries that each produce under 2 per cent of the world's emissions together account for around 40 per cent of global emissions. Our national target is achievable, balanced and responsible, and is part of coordinated global action to deliver a healthy environment for future generations, while keeping our economy strong.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has agreed to take action on all 76 recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne. In doing so, we have recognised the contribution the mortgage braking sector makes to competition and the valuable service it provides to many Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mortgage brokers provide consumers with more choice when it comes to obtaining a mortgage and support smaller lenders who are otherwise unable to compete with the big banks. The Government wants more mortgage brokers, not less. We want to work in partnership with the sector to make it stronger, not weaker. That is why we have decided not to prohibit trail commissions on new loans as recommended by Commissioner Hayne but rather review their operation in three years' time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This review will follow the introduction of a number of new measures the Government has already announced including: a best interests duty that will legally require mortgage brokers to act in the best interests of consumers; a new requirement that the value of upfront commissions be linked to the amount drawn-down by borrowers; a ban on campaign and volume-based commissions; and a two year limit on claw-back, starting from 1 July 2020.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 29 July 2019, originally directed to the Treasurer, regarding the sale of Australian land - Petition number EN0877. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment brings many benefits to Australia. It supports existing jobs and creates new jobs, encourages innovation and the induction of new technologies and skills, provides access to markets, and promotes competition amongst our industries. However, the Australian Government also recognises that foreign ownership of certain Australian assets may raise community concerns.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, the Government maintains a robust foreign investment screening regime to ensure that acquisitions of Australian land, or other Australian assets, by foreign persons is not contrary to the national interest. As part of this regime, the Government screens all proposed foreign investment transactions (above certain monetary thresholds) on a case-by-case basis, and has the ability to prohibit a transaction from occurring if it is likely to be contrary to our national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where an acquisition of Australian land is not prohibited, the Government's policies are also further designed to promote Australian interests. For example, a foreign person is generally prohibited from buying Australian agricultural land, unless Australians had also been offered an equal opportunity to purchase that land. Similarly, where a foreign person seeks to acquire an interest in residential land, the Government's policy is to channel that investment into new dwellings, rather than established dwellings, as this creates additional jobs in the construction industry, can increase government revenues, and increases Australia's housing stock.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on Australia's foreign investment regime, including how it relates to acquisitions of Australian land, can be found on the Foreign Investment Review Board website at: www.firb.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 29 July 2019 about Petition EN0884 regarding Australian Government support for informal kinship carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the importance of ensuring children and young people are safe and well and values the important contribution of kinship carers who provide loving homes for children who are unable to live with their parents. Kinship carers face many challenges, especially those who are caring for children outside the state or territory statutory care and protection system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners call for the Government to abolish "informal care" nationally and to have one national law to provide consistency across states and territories. In Australia, state and territory governments have responsibility for the statutory care and protection of children and young people experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect, including the child protection and out-of-home care systems. Each jurisdiction has its own legislation, policies and practices that govern who is a formal or informal carer and the support provided to carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Kinship carers are eligible for the full range of Australian Government family assistance payments such as Family Tax Benefit, Parenting Payment, Child Care Subsidy and the Foster Child Health Care Card to help with the costs of raising children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners request a Royal Commission into kinship care nationwide. They may be interested to know that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee held an inquiry into grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren in 2013 and another into out-of-home care in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of the recommendations of the inquiry into out-of-home care are being addressed through the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Framework for Protecting Australia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Children 2009-2020</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>(the National Framework). The National Framework provides the critical foundation for governments and non-government organisations to work together to achieve our shared vision that Australia's children and young people are safe and well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Improving stability and permanency for children in out-of-home care was a major theme of the inquiry's recommendations and is a priority under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fourth Action Plan 2018-2020 </span>of the National Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners request the redevelopment of generic forms to take into account their unique circumstances and for easy access to allowances. Kinship carers, both formal and informal, may find the Grandparent Adviser program useful in navigating the support options available for their situation. Grandparent Advisers are available to all non-parent carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based in the Department of Human Services (DHS), Grandparent Advisers provide support, advice and assistance to non-parent carers accessing government payments and services. Advisers also provide referrals to other community services providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Grandparent Advisers can be contacted via DHS on 1800 245 956. More information can be found at www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/grandparent-advisers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Social Services (DSS) also funds a range of services for any individual caring for a child, including kinship carers in a formal or informal caring role. These include peer support groups, playgroups and educational resources. Carers can use the search function at the DSS Grants Service Directory (www.serviceproviders.dss.gov.au/) to identify relevant services within their area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DSS-funded Raising Children Network website provides a complete resource for Australian parents and carers. It provides evidence-based information about raising children and caring for oneself as a parent or carer. The section on grandparent and kinship carers at www.raisingchildren.netau/grandparent_carers/being_a_grandparent_carer.html provides articles, videos and the opportunity to take part in grandparent and kinship carer forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to provide national leadership and drive work with state and territory governments to deliver concrete actions to improve outcomes for some of Australia's most vulnerable children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust the information provided will be of assistance to the petitioners. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />I refer to your letter of 29 July 2019 regarding petition number EN0893 concerning amendments to section 8 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 8 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act provides that a House of the Parliament does not have power to expel a member from membership of a House. The petitioner's proposal seeks to enable a House to expel members where a House is 'acting in accordance with the freely expressed will of the people as determined by such method as deemed acceptable to the parliament', such as an electronic petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am conscious that in responding to the petitioner's reform proposals that neither I nor officers of my department provide legal advice to parliamentary committees or to members of the public. However, the following general comments may be of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not proposing any change to section 8 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The composition of parliament is determined by the Australian people at regular elections. This was acknowledged by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its report of October 1984 which recommended the abolition of the power of the Houses to expel their members (at para 7.96):</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">... it is for the electors, not Members, to decide on the composition of Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our system of representative democracy is enshrined in the Constitution. Sections 7 and 24 provide that members of Parliament are 'directly chosen by the people'. The grounds for disqualification of a member are set out in section 44 of the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The House of Representatives and the Senate respond to disorderly conduct under the relevant standing orders, which provide for suspensions. For example, standing orders 203 and 204 of the Senate enable the suspension of a senator who has committed an offence for up to 14 sitting days. An offence is defined in standing order 203(1) as follows:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 29 July 2019, concerning petition EN0902 to change the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>(Fair Work Act) to include 'high income' employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Act, including the National Employment Standards, modern awards and the national minimum wage, provides a safety net of entitlements for national system employees. Fair Work Act coverage, including the National Employment Standards, is not based on the employee's income level, an employee is covered if their employer is a national system employer. The National Employment Standards include an entitlement to maternity leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some employees are not covered by modern awards due to the nature and seniority of their role, and the unfair dismissal provisions of the Fair Work Act have an income test, but that does not exempt them from the Fair Work Act in general or the National Employment Standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The general protections provisions in the Fair Work Act prohibit adverse action (including dismissal and loss of shifts) by an employer against its employees for discriminatory reasons, including disability, sex, age, family or carer's responsibilities, and pregnancy. It is also unlawful to take adverse action against an employee because of the employee's workplace rights. These protections also apply to prospective employees and apply regardless of an employee's income level.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 8 August 2019 and the opportunity to respond to Petition EN0904 presented to the House of Representatives on 29 July 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to advise that the Australian Government will establish the National Water Grid Authority (the Authority), which was announced during the election campaign. As part of its work, the Authority will consider options for developing large-scale water capture and transfer schemes, such as elements of the Bradfield Scheme or hybrid versions of the Bradfield Scheme, to capture and transport rainwater to grow our agricultural sector, to improve stock and domestic supply, and for flood mitigation and drought proofing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Authority will deliver on the Government's commitment to invest $100 million to bring together world-best science and identify opportunities to increase water supply and reliability. The Government is committed to the sustainable development of Australia's water resources and integrating our water infrastructure to support the growth of regional Australia and meet the demands of a growing population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Authority will lead a robust and science-based assessment of Australia's water resources to identify real opportunities where new water infrastructure can be built. It will look to harvest unallocated water resources that can increase the capacity, connectivity and resilience of Australia's water storage and supply infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Authority will work in partnership with state and territory governments to develop a national pipeline of strategic water infrastructure initiatives to enhance water security and help make Australia's water supply more resilient during periods of drought.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In establishing the Authority, the Australian Government is providing national leadership to plan for and meet the water needs of our fanners, businesses and regional communities and to secure the future prosperity of all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Indigenous Australians</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representations of 9 September 2019 concerning petition EN0923. The petitioners requested the Australian Government consider a new way of governance and expenditure for Indigenous Australians, both at the national and state and territory level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the request to establish Indigenous governing bodies for each state and territory. The Australian Constitution clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the federal, state and territory levels, including the right to self-govern. As such, consideration of establishing a body at the state or territory level, as requested by the petitioners, is a matter for that jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government recognises that Indigenous Australians want their voices heard at all levels of governmentâlocal, state and federal. The Government is continuing to take steps to ensure there is greater representation of Indigenous voices at all levels of decision making. In conjunction with states, territories and community, a model for a local, regional and national 'voice' will be developed through a co-design process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In order to progress this important work, the Government has allocated $7.3 million for co-design of models to improve local and regional decision-making and develop options for constitutional recognition. I acknowledge there are many views on this, including the ideas put forward in the petition. By listening to Elders, families and communities, we can drive practical, locally-led change, and I look forward to a range of ideas being explored through the co-design process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Minister for Indigenous Australians, I have undertaken to listen to all views, and will not pre-empt the process and outcomes of the discussions we will be having over the coming months. The Government is committed to having these discussions with Indigenous people and the broader Australian community, to represent the diversity of views held.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Government is committed to recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. Constitutional recognition is too important to get wrong and too important to rush.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will work together with the community and Parliament to develop and bring forward a consensus option, in this term of Parliament, for the constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 September 2019, referring petition number EN0929 to me as the Minister responsible for electoral policy. The petition advocates the creation of a public register of political party positions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years, successful reforms to Australia's electoral system have followed work conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The Committee is able to consider issues raised in public submissions across a broad range of connected topics, including issues like those raised in your letter. I encourage the petitioners to engage with the Committee with respect to the issues raised. Further information can be found at: www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Electoral_Matters. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to transparency. It is incumbent on individual parties and candidates to communicate with Australian voters. Action by any Government in this regard may be seen as potentially seeking to influence the election process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are, however, existing mechanisms that allow citizens to track political commitments and policies. For example, the Parliamentary Budget Office publishes a report after each election that shows the budget implications of the election commitments made by each of the major parties. This report shows the fiscal cost of each individual commitment and the aggregate impact of the commitments taken together.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this report is to provide transparency around the fiscal impact of election commitments. From the next general election onwards, this report will include the medium-term (10 year) impact of all election commitments and minor parties will be able to have their commitments included in the report if they so choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On top of this, the Australian Government Budget Papers provide a picture of Australia's forecast financial performance and the government's fiscal policy for the forward years. The Budget includes estimates of Government revenue and expenses over a specified period. These papers are available for public scrutiny.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, the Australian Parliament House website provides a wide collection of information on the speeches and voting records of elected officials, as well as current legislation and parliamentary committees. This information can be found at: https://www.aph.gov.au/</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 September 2019, referring petition number EN0946 to Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters. As the Minister responsible for electoral policy, the matter has been referred to me for response. The petition requested that our democracy include elements of Direct Democracy in the form of recall elections and initiatives that allow citizens to directly participate in policy decisions. I respond to the petition's request below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a representative democracy in the Westminster traditionâeligible electors vote for candidates to carry out the business of governing on their behalf. The commitment to representative government is embedded in the Australian Constitution, which provides that both houses of the Federal Parliament are to be 'directly chosen by the people' (sections 7 and 24).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are mechanisms within our representative model of government that allow direct citizen participation in law making and policy review. For example, parliamentary committees, such as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM), provide a channel for communication between parliament and the public that encourages greater community participation in the parliamentary process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where considered necessary and/or appropriate the Government can seek the views of the nation outside of an election context. The Australian Government's Postal Marriage Law Survey (the Survey) held from 12 September to 7 November 2017, and the three national plebiscitesâtwo on the conscription of troops during World War 1 and one on a national song in 1977âare examples.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no plans to alter the electoral system to allow for recall elections. Fundamental changes to our elections such as those proposed in this petition are often considered by the JSCEM and developed with cross-party support, so they can be enacted. Accordingly, the petitioners may wish to approach the JSCEM with their ideas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have copied this letter to the Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 9 September 2019 regarding petition number EN0948, requesting clarification as to the status of the 'law and the Gospel of God' in Australia. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring these matters to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither I nor officers of my department provide legal advice to the public. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment on legal aspects raised in the petition. If the petitioners have concerns about any particular laws or have legal queries, they may wish to seek independent legal advice. However, the following general comments may be of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a democracy which respects the separation of church and state. Section 116 of the Constitution reflects this state of affairs. In broad terms, section 116 of the Constitution prevents the Commonwealth making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance or prohibiting the free exercise of religion. Nor can the Commonwealth pass a law requiring a 'religious test' for an office or public trust under the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that section 116 does not prohibit action simply because it might be said, in one way or another, to relate to a religious organisation. In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Attorney-General (Vic); ex red Black v Commonwealth </span>(1981) 146 CLR 559, for example, a challenge to Commonwealth grants for distribution among denominational schools was rejected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As to the petitioners queries about the oath or affirmation of allegiance set out in the Schedule to the Constitution (see also section 42 of the Constitution), it may be of interest that the <span style="font-style:italic;">House of Representatives Practice </span>(7th ed.) states that 'the oath of allegiance need not necessarily be made on the authorised version of the Bible, although this has been the common practice. A Member may recite the oath while holding another form of Christian holy book, or, in respect of a non-Christian faith, a book or work of such a nature. The essential requirement is that every Member taking an oath should take it in a manner which affects his or her conscience regardless of whether a holy book is used or not' (p 144) </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to the highest environmental standards. Our central environmental law, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act), establishes a rigorous and transparent regulatory framework for protecting nationally important environmental matters, such as threatened species and World Heritage properties.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 September 2019, referring petition number EN0979 to Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters. As the Minister responsible for electoral policy, the matter has been referred to me for response. The petition requested that a number of initiatives be taken up in preparation for the 2022 Federal election. I respond to each element of the petition's request below.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of process that support voting, Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs), a digital database used to electronically check off a voter's name from a centralised electoral roll, have been used on a trial basis by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) since the 2013 Federal election. ECLs are being increasingly used by the AEC at all electoral events. The Government is working with the AEC to investigate the expanded use of polling place technology for future electoral events.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A person must provide proof of their identity when they enrol to vote. Section 98AA of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </span>(the Electoral Act) outlines the evidence of identity requirements which must accompany a claim for enrolment. Acceptable evidence includes a person's Australian driver's licence, Australian passport or confirmation of the person's identity in the approved form, signed by another person who is enrolled to vote.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, sections 200D1 and 229 of the Electoral Act specify questions that must be put to a voter in order to ascertain their identity at the issuing point of a polling place, prior to giving them a ballot paper. These questions identify the details of the voter's full name, their registered address and whether they have voted before in the relevant election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any implementation of additional voter identification requirements would require careful management so to ensure the integrity of electoral system, and maintaining public confidence so that groups of eligible voters are not disenfranchised from voting (for example persons who are homeless, persons escaping domestic violence and others that have difficulty obtaining positive identification).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) assessed electronic voting options for future Australian elections in its inquiry into the 2013 Federal election. JSCEM identified significant questions over the capacity of an electronic voting solution to be both cost-effective and protect the security and sanctity of the ballot in the Australian context. JSCEM concluded that 'there can be no widespread introduction of electronic voting in the near term without massive costs and unacceptable security risks'. There is a strong commitment by all Australian governments to maintain the security and integrity of Australian elections.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration of the current early voting mechanisms and the pre-poll period is an appropriate issue for JSCEM, who have indicated that pre-polling is expected to be examined in its current inquiry into the 2019 Federal election.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is open to JSCEM to consider the relative merits of optional preferential voting as part of its inquiry into the 2019 Federal election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Senate voting system was reformed in 2016, when the Government passed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 2016 </span>(the Amendment Act). The Amendment Act abolished group and individual voting tickets, while enhancing vote savings provisions, designed to increase the franchise and support the democratic process. The Amendment Act introduced optional preferential voting above and below the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This reform returned the control of preferences to voters, simplifying the Senate voting system and improving the ability for voters to express their voting intent. Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation of 5 August 2019, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Number PN0055âthe Zone Tax Offset and Kangaroo Island. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>have responsibility for this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Committee would be aware following the then Assistant Treasurer's response a similar petition (EN0049), on 28 November 2018 I requested that the Productivity Commission undertake a review into the ongoing form and function of remote area tax assistance, including the zone tax offset, to ensure it remains fair and contemporary. The review commenced in February 2019 and the Commission is due to report to Australian Government by February 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the review the Commission has undertaken broad public consultation, including meeting directly with regional communities and inviting public submissions. The Commission will also seek further public comment on a draft version of the report, which will be available on the Commission's website in September 2019.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 6 August 2019, in your capacity as chair of the Petitions Committee (the Committee) for the House of Representatives, regarding road safety concerns in the Gympie region and Fraser Coast on the Bruce Highway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the devastation caused by the number of road fatalities on the Bruce Highway and right across Australia each year. The Australian Government is committed to delivering its $100 billion Infrastructure Investment Program which is focused on improving road safety, driving economic growth, increasing productivity and connectivity, and creating new employment opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of road safety on the Bruce Highway, the Government has committed $10 billion from 2013-14 to 2027-28 to deliver projects under the Bruce Highway Upgrade Program (BHUP) that will improve safety, flood immunity and reduce congestion along the corridor. From this commitment, approximately $1.9 billion has been committed to specific road safety projects. These include the installation of wire-rope barriers, intersection upgrades, pavement widening, resurfacing and wide centre line treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the request for the construction of the Cooroy to Curia Section D project to be fast-tracked. As you are aware, the Government has committed $800 million towards the $1 billion project. Major construction is expected to commence by mid-2020 and be completed by early 2024, weather permitting. I can advise that the Government has been working with the Queensland Government to accelerate this project, as such, approximately $449 million has been brought into the current Forward Estimates since the project was announced at the 2018-19 Budget to help deliver this commitment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of the project delivery, I can also advise that early interim works for the project commenced in March 2019 and were completed in July 2019. This included the relocation of public utilities and other preparatory works to mitigate any potential risk to delivery time frames. The project Business Case is currently under assessment by Infrastructure Australia; following this process, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Cities can complete its assessment for my consideration.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Committee for its ongoing concern for road safety on the Bruce Highway and the delivery of road and rail infrastructure across Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the letter dated 5 April 2019 from the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Mrs Lucy Wicks MP, to the former Minister for Communications, Senator the Hon Mitch Fifield, concerning the imminent disconnection of television retransmission in Speewah (PN0401). I am responding to that letter as the matters raised now fall within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Television broadcasters are not required to provide terrestrial coverage to every community in their licence areas. As a result, terrestrial retransmission services have been established in some communities to provide or improve terrestrial television coverage. These are typically operated by self-help providers, such as local councils, mining companies and local community organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Speewah is one such place - with the retransmission licence for Speewah and the retransmission equipment owned and operated by the Mareeba Shire Council (the Council). The decision to no longer operate the retransmission service is a matter for the Council.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that disconnection of television retransmission in Speewah is now proposed for 1 September 2019.1 further understand that modelling by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), indicates that, once retransmission in Speewah stops, some areas in Speewah may be able to receive terrestrial television coverage from the Cairns and Cairns North transmission sites. However the predicted coverage level is variable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Those residents of Speewah who cannot receive reliable terrestrial television coverage may wish to apply for access to the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. The VAST service was established in 2010 as part of the switchover to digital television. It provides all areas of Australia with access to a comprehensive range of standard and high definition digital free-to-air television services. The Australian Government provides funding to the television broadcasters to support the cost of transmitting free-to-air television channels over the satellite platform. VAST is also supported by contributions from the broadcasters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The VAST service includes the full suite of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) digital television services. The ABC1 service is provided on an individual state and territory basis. In Eastern Australia, the commercial free-to-air channels available on VAST are provided by Imparja Television and Southern Cross Austereo drawing on content from the Seven, Nine and Ten networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The VAST service also includes dedicated news channels carrying nightly bulletins from regional commercial television broadcasters. For example, WIN News (channel 401) and 7 News (channel 412) provide regional news for Cairns/Townsville, Queensland. Further information on VAST channels, including the radio channels that are also available on VAST, is available at www.sattvguide.corn.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are no subscription fees or other ongoing costs for VAST. However, viewers do require satellite reception equipment (a roof-top dish) and an authorised VAST set-top box. Access to the commercial channels on VAST is available through a smart card system managed by the commercial broadcasters and overseen by the ACMA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As with all areas of Australia, viewers are responsible for the purchase, installation and maintenance of their own television reception equipment, including screens, set-top boxes, recorders, cabling, antennas and satellite dishes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting water resources is a key component of the approval conditions. Adani are required to prepare comprehensive groundwater management plans and strategies and undertake monitoring to detect any changes to groundwater early, setting of early warning triggers, and identification and implementation of measures to address any unforeseen impacts. They must also implement measures to return 3,650 million litres per year to the Great Artesian Basin to replace water used during mining.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The emissions arising from the use of coal from individual mines are addressed by national and international measures to deal with climate change more broadly. The complex, global nature of emissions is best addressed with such measures, rather than by trying to connect climate change impacts to individual mining projects. At the international level, Australia is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Australia also has a comprehensive set of policies to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, including through the Emissions Reduction Fund, Safeguard Mechanism, Renewable Energy Target, and National Energy Productivity Plan.</span>

These agreements are referred to as Indigenous Land Use Agreements.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I previously informed the House of recent enhancements made to the e-petitioning system. These enhancements have simplified online petitioning and made sharing petitions through social media more intuitive. We have now seen the benefits of these enhancements as we have watched a petition titled 'Declare a Climate Emergency' reach the highest number of signatures for an e-petition, with over 400,000 signatures. I thank all principled petitioners and all Australians who signed petitions to the House. It is encouraging that so many people are having their say to the parliament. I also thank staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services, who responded quickly to some technical issues that arose during the signing period of this petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This petition has increased public awareness of petitions more broadly and prompted questions about what happens to a petition after it's presented. Misinformation played a fairly significant part during the signing period for this petition, with people incorrectly suggesting on social media that a certain number of signatures would trigger a debate in the House. Our thanks go to the House media team, who worked hard to get the correct information out there. The committee will continue these efforts to better inform the Australian public on the petitioning process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that has become clear through feedback from the public is that Australians expect debate on petitions that reach a certain threshold of signatures. This currently occurs in other parliaments such as the UK and New South Wales. In the 45th Parliament, the Petitions Committee recommended that petitions over 20,000 signatures be considered for debate at a dedicated time in the Federation Chamber. The committee also sought to encourage members to give notice of debate on petitions during private members' business time as this procedure is already available to members in the House. The committee will work to educate members about how to get involved in petitions as part of a wider campaign to increase awareness of the petitions in the House. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am again introducing the Refugee Protection Bill 2019, which I tabled earlier in the year during the last parliament as well as an earlier version in June 2018, because there is still no sustainable long-term plan for refugee protection from either the coalition or the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Confining people for an indefinite period of time, whether it be on Christmas Island, in Nauru or on Manus, was never a lawful, ethical or affordable policy. It's grossly inhuman, breaches international human rights and refugee law, shirks Australia's global and regional responsibilities and is outrageously expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, under Australia's current policy we have confined people indefinitely for years, including many children from time to time. These are mostly people who have committed no crime, people who are vulnerable and traumatised, people who have been separated from their families for years and years, and people who came to our country seeking protection under international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The physical and mental suffering of these people cannot be understated. Indeed, under the medevac legislation, where people can only be transferred for urgent medical treatment to save their lives, over 130 applications have already been approved, with many more applications pending. That's a lot of gravely-ill people, and many of them sick because of the way they have been treated in Australia's offshore detention. Twelve people have died. In this context, it simply beggars belief that the government is ignoring the advice of Australian medical professionals and wants to repeal medevac.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply shocking how brazenly the government, and the opposition, ignore the international laws and standards that Australia helped create. How dare the parliament ignore the fact that successive Australian governments signed up to the refugee convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. No wonder we're singled out and criticised by the United Nations and other organisationsâproof positive that we've lost the moral authority we once enjoyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the cost of all this? Between 2013 and 2016, Australia's network of offshore detention gulags cost the taxpayer $9.6 billion. According to figures published just year, the annual cost of offshore detention continues to be a staggering $573,000 per personâreaching approximately $340 million each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can, and must, do better. To that end I've recently written to the Prime Minister asking him to take up New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. Surely these people have been suffering too long. Instead of treating them as political footballs, we need to relocate them immediately as a way through this impasse. And then we need bipartisan support to implement the Refugee Protection Bill, which is before the House today, because this bill would finally provide a sustainable, humane and equitable response to the protection and processing of asylum seekers and refugees in the Asia-Pacific region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, this bill is the enabling legislation for Australia to commence the process of seeking to establish the Asia-Pacific asylum seeker solution, or APASS. This would be a genuine regional solution, developed in accordance with international human rights law and UNHCR guidelines, based on a regional framework for the registration, processing and settlement of asylum seekers and refugees. Importantly, it would build on existing forums, such as the Bali Process, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asian Dialogue of Forced Migrations. In outline, the bill would facilitate the establishment of a network of centres located in and run by Asia-Pacific countries, where asylum seekers could go to be registered, have their immediate humanitarian needs met and lodge a preference for country of resettlement. If the asylum seeker selects Australia and it's within the specified quota, their claim would be assessed in Australia with appropriate oversight, limited time frames and judicial review. The bill does not allow mandatory detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that Australia is seen to take the initiative here because Australia's current deterrence based policies have placed so much pressure on neighbouring countries. This is why Australia must act first to amend its own domestic laws to fit with APASS in order to gain trust within the region. This was one of the reasons I was deeply disappointed by Labor's response to constituents regarding previous versions of this bill, where Labor claimed it was, 'Seeking to dictate to our regional neighbours how to manage asylum seeker populations' and 'Commits regional nations to actions without their consent or engagement'. What a load of rubbish! If Labor had bothered to read the bill, they'd see that a fundamental principle of APASS is cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of each member country as well as being alert to the difficulties and priorities of refugee protection for each country involved. No wonder the community is confused about Labor's asylum seeker policy when Labor criticises the government's policy despite helping create it and promising to maintain it and then turns around and criticises the viable APASS alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd simply add that this bill incorporates into domestic law multiple international instruments to which Australia is already a signatory. These instruments as well as the principle of family unity and the principle of the best interest of the child are paramount to the development of the APASS framework. Crucially, this bill abolishes unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers and refugees. It removes the abhorrent and torturous conditions that asylum seekers and refugees currently experience under Australian law in both onshore and offshore detention. It provides an alternative to detention, allowing asylum seekers to live in the community, and clearly states that any detention must be, in Australia, lawful, necessary and proportionate and for the shortest time possible. And any immigration detention is subject to ongoing judicial review and will be independently monitored on a regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd remind everyone in this space that we need to stop talking about asylum seekers and refugees as a threat to national security and start recognising that Australia has a legal and moral obligation to give protection to asylum seekers, to quickly hear their claims and to provide permanent refuge if those claims are correct. I commend this bill to the House. And, in my remaining time, I invite the member for Indi to make a short contribution.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I rise to second the Refugee Protection Bill proposed by the member for Clark, and I do so knowing that so many people of my electorate of Indi and so many people of Australia stand beside me. I believe this because this is the issue on which I receive the most correspondence and personal calls for action from the people in my electorate, and the people are calling for a better response than what our leaders have given us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rural Australians for Refugees Group, that is so active in my community, has called on me to work with this parliament to do better, and I am committed to doing just that. For too long in this country we have been sold the idea by our successive governments that to be kind we must be cruel, that if we want to avoid people drowning at sea we must detain those who don't. We've been told that if we want to end people smuggling then we must keep people who arrive by boat in indefinite detention. But we know, as evidenced by the large number of people arriving by plane, people are still coming and will continue to come. Offshore indefinite detention is a cruel stopgap that should have been dismantled long ago and replaced with a system that actually creates a fair, orderly process that gets people safely and quickly settled into our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People I meet are devastated by what we've become. They want better than this. They want better than this because so many of us see ourselves in these peopleâconvicts forced to board boats to Sydney, Jewish people leaving Europe as fascism dawned, the Vietnamese evacuating Saigon, the South Sudanese fleeing the war with their northern neighbours. Australians want a better solution, because when we see people in these camps we see ourselves. And we know that, much as they deserve better, we deserve better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want a nation that has control of its sea borders but does not leave desperate people to languish indefinitely in prisons. The Asia-Pacific asylum seeker solution does both of these things at once by creating a network of centres across the region. People no longer have an incentive to risk their lives on boats. By enabling people to apply at these centres we have a single, virtual queue where we are completely in control over who is granted asylum to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Independent, I see my role as advocating for sensible compromise policies that reflect what Australians actually want their politicians to do. This is an elegant law that meets the objectives of the government without debasing the fairness and egalitarianism that mark us out as Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months we have had hundreds of thousands of young people in Australia and around the world take to the streets to demand action from their governments to fight the climate crisis. Mostly teenagers, they recognise that we are in a climate emergency. This rising-up by the world's young is almost unprecedented in human history, which is not surprising because the climate crisis we all face is unprecedented in human history and the youth of today know it. They also know that it's on their shoulders that the terrible burden of the climate crisis will rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The year 2078 I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else and yet you're stealing their future in front of their very eyes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's young people are also some of the most educated and knowledgeable young people in human history. High-school retention rates around the world have never been higher, and our youth have access to the internet storehouse of information and the means of instant social communication in the palms of their hands. They know what is happening to the world, and they know who is responsible. They are, by definition, model active citizens. Yet most of the world's young people, including Australian teenagers, are denied the right to vote and to determine their country's, and therefore the world's, future, and that is why they have taken to the streets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that this reality of the climate crisis is one of the most profound reasons why our longstanding policy of enfranchising young people should finally, once and for all, be implemented. That's why today I'm proud to introduce to the House this bill to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Before I outline the details of the bill and the specific changes to the law it makes, I want to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Jordon Steele-John for developing this bill. Senator Steele-John first introduced this bill to the Senate last year. I want to commend him and take note of the strong campaign that he is running not only to give young people the right to vote but also to secure their rights more broadly. The average age of politicians in this place is around 50, so is it any wonder that young people feel disenfranchised by parliamentary politics? We need more leaders like Senator Steele-John in this parliament. He outlined very clearly the need for this bill when introducing it to the Senate last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are almost 600,000 of us who are, by and large, deemed to be adults by our society and yet cannot participate in the decisions being made about their future. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can work full time, pay tax, contribute to superannuation, drive a car and own a car and therefore pay stamp duty to contribute to maintenance of our roads and public transport infrastructure. They can legally have sex and make medical decisions about their bodies. They can join our political parties, all except, of course, the absent Ms Hanson's party. In many cases, they can be treated as an adult by our criminal justice system. In short, they cannot vote although they are treated in many ways by our society as adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦Â Â Â â¦Â Â Â â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My generation will have to live with the consequences of the decisions made in this place for the longest time. The fact that I am the youngest person in this place by close to a decade, and that I am the only person under the age of 30, speaks volumes about the lack of representation of Australia's young people in our political system. It is time we recognised 16- and 17-year-olds and their contribution. It is time we recognised they should have the right to a vote and that they make an enormous contribution to our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mechanism to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote is relatively straightforward. The bill includes amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 are intended to lower the minimum age of a voter in Australian federal elections and referenda from 18 years of age to 16 years of age while keeping the minimum age of compulsory voting and eligibility to stand as a federal parliamentarian at 18 years of age. This change would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to be added to the electoral roll in preparation for their eligibility to vote at 16 years of age. The changes to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 are intended to ensure that the Electoral Commissioner includes 16- and 17-year-olds in the certified list of voters and that 16- and 17-year-olds will not be given a penalty notice if they don't vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, by lowering the voting age to 16 but leaving the compulsory age for voting at 18, we're creating a grace period for young people, allowing them to familiarise themselves with the electoral process, giving them the right to vote if they so choose but without the fear of being penalised if they don't. It will facilitate greater civics education and allow teachers to bring the democratic process itselfânot partisan politicsâinto classrooms in a tangible way. It will foster a culture of civic participation amongst young people, leaving them in good stead for the rest of their lives, as we know that voting is in fact a habit, and we want them to form this habit early so that it stays with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some positive international experiences of lowering the voting age. In Scotland, for example, during the independence referendum in 2014 a decision was made to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote and to participate for the first time. Almost 80 per cent of that age group turned out. That cohort now continues to turn out at a much higher rate than their predecessors who weren't given an earlier opportunity. In Austria the 16- and 17-year-old demographic has a higher level of participation than the 18-to-25-year-old demographic, proving that this kind of reform works. In Austria, 16- and 17-year-olds are now able to vote in most elections. These international experiences should give us the confidence to make this reform here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill seeks to update our archaic electoral practices that say, 'You are not allowed to participate on election day if you have not updated your details on the electoral roll.' It is 2019, and we should be flexible enough in our system to allow people to do so at a polling place on polling day. This bill provides that Australians who are eligible to vote but who are not yet on the electoral roll or are not enrolled at their correct address can enrol to vote or update their address at a polling centre on election day or at an early voting centre and will be deemed to be enrolled at that address and eligible to cast a provisional vote at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We regularly hear in the commentary the bemoaning of young people's lack of engagement in society or the deploring of them for always being on their mobile phones, but when Australia's students lead the country's participation in the global climate strike, we heard the same politicians and adults complaining about their skipping school and getting involved in politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some politicians and shock jocks like to suggest that young people are somehow being manipulated or are not thinking for themselves. In the same vein, the objections raised against young people having a vote suggest that young people are not smart or independent enough to vote, that they are not ready enough to make such big decisions. These are the same objections that were made 200 years ago against working men having a vote or a century ago against women having a vote or, more recently, against Aboriginal Australians having a voteâarguments that we no longer accept. The Australian Greens reject such discrimination. We believe that young people, like all Australians, are capable of making decisions for themselves. We don't fear more democratic participation; in fact, we welcome it. We are confident that if young people have the vote they will use it wisely. It's time to lower the voting age to 16 in Australia and show our young people that we, here in this place, hear them, that we care about their opinions and that we are working for their future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion responds to the calls from more than 370,000 Australians who have participated in the largest ever e-petition to this parliament, calling for this parliament to recognise climate change as an emergency. It also follows the example of the UK, Canadian, Irish and other parliaments, not to mention literally dozens and dozens of councils here in Australia and across the world, who have made a similar declaration. Since October last year, in just the past 12 months, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, the world's leading climate scientists, have issued three reports, each more urgent than the last. In essence, those reports tell us that the window is closing on our generation's ability to discharge our responsibilities set out in the Paris climate agreementânamely, to ensure that global warming is kept well below two degrees above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Those reports, particularly the report issued 12 months ago by the world's leading climate scientists, tell us that substantial cuts in emissions are going to be necessary over the course of the 2020s if we are to have any reasonable hope of keeping to those important thresholds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, here in Australia, the Australian Medical Association, the AMA, followed the lead of its British and American counterparts in also declaring that climate change is a health emergency, because we've received advice after advice over many years of the health impacts we're already seeing through climate change but will only get worse over time if we don't meet those Paris commitments. Earlier this year, the World Economic Forum, which surveys the world's leading global business leaders, found that, of the 10 leading global risks identified by those leaders, the top three were extreme weather events, a failure to mitigate climate change, and natural disasters, reflecting advice from the Reserve Bank earlier this month about the risks to the global financial system that are posed by climate change and the legal responsibilities that company directors are now recognised as having, as identified by APRA, ASIC and economic regulators across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is currently on track to exceed three degrees of global warming, which would be utterly catastrophic for the planet and for humanity. There is a dangerous level of complacency that has crept into the public debate, and particularly the parliamentary debate on climate change here in Australia. We're told by the Prime Minister and leading media figures that we're going to meet our Paris commitments in a canter and everything is going fine. Well, Australia's Paris targets are consistent with more than three degrees of global warming and we frankly are just not on track to meet those. Our Kyoto commitment is to cut, by next year, our carbon emissions by five per cent on 2000 levels, but only in the last several weeks the government has released projections showing that in 2020 carbon emissions will actually be higher than they were in 2000, not five per cent below. Carbon emissions are projected by the government's own department to continue rising all the way to 2030. So, at best, we'll be seven per cent below 2005 levels by that year, not the 26 to 28 per cent below that the government signed up to in the Paris agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this means that we are failing our children, our grandchildren and generations beyond that, because it is within the power of this generation to ensure that global warming is kept well below two degrees and that we pursue efforts around 1.5, recognising that two degrees is not a safe threshold. According to the world's leading climate scientists, even two degrees of global warming will mean that more than 99 per cent of the world's coral reefs are lost. According to the World Bank, it will mean that by the middle of the century global cereal production will have reduced by 20 per cent and by as much as 50 per cent in the continent of Africa. This complacency also means that Australia is missing out on very serious investment and job opportunities. For example, according to Bloomberg, renewable energy investment has been slashed by 50 per cent already in just the first six months of this year. This motion is a chance for the parliament to change course. It's not a substantive motion in policy terms but it is an attempt to have the parliament recognise the gravity of this challenge.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for Hindmarsh. It is clear that with this motion Labor is simply jumping on sensationalist, populist sentiment. They prefer to put forward this grand symbolic gesture rather than actually committing to policies that will reduce carbon emissions. In contrast, our government has a plan, one that we took to the Australian people. Part of this plan is to effectively act on climate change and meet our emissions reduction target for 2020, as agreed in Kyoto. We also have a plan to meet our emissions reduction target for 2030, as detailed in the Paris accord global agreement. We can do this in a balanced and responsible way. We can work with our global partners to deliver a healthy environment for future generations, whilst keeping our economy strong. This is why we have invested $3.5 billion into our Climate Solutions Package, which will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to reach our Paris targets. The Climate Solutions Fund is a great program, one that brings to $4.55 billion our support for businesses, landholders, farmers and Indigenous Australians, through practical climate solutions. The Climate Solutions Fund gives Australians the incentive to adopt smarter practices and technologies to reduce greenhouse gases and, at the same time, earn additional revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tambua Regeneration Project is a great example of what is being delivered through the fund. Tambua station is a farm located near Cobar in New South Wales. The Evans family owns the property and recently celebrated 100 years and five generations on the land. Over the years, the family has overcome a number of challenges that often occur with farming, including drought and bushfires. The Evans family, supported by an Emissions Reduction Fund contract over 10 years, is establishing permanent native forests on the property. They've been growing these forests from seed on land that was previously cleared and on which regrowth has been suppressed for 10 years. These new forests will effectively become carbon sinks, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is a great example of responsible stewardship. This is one example of thousands that's being implemented without great fanfare and sensationalism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also projects being delivered in my electorate of Cowper. Through the Emissions Reductions Fund, we have invested $1 million to help Biomass Solutions in Coffs Harbour produce compost from the organic waste collected in three neighbouring local government areas. We will be investing a further $2 million in this project in the near future. The fund also has enabled the New South Wales office of environment, energy and science to plant $800,000 worth of new native trees on land that had previously been cleared for agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making the investment necessary to bring about change. In fact, in 2018, Australia led the world in clean energy investment, with more than double the per capita investment of other leading nations like France and the United Kingdom. We are, therefore, doing more per capita than any of these countries who saw fit to declare a climate emergency, highlighting the redundant nature of this motion by Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than being reactive, we have announced some proactive steps to mitigate the current climate change and drought in Australia. Drought is debilitating for regional communities like those in my electorate of Cowper. But, rather than offer redundant, symbolic gestures, like this motion, we have acted decisively to invest $3.5 billion in water infrastructure to fast-track the construction of new dams, weirs and pipelines. This will guarantee new and affordable water for regional Australia into the future and unlock the economic potential for new and expanded agricultural production. We have also been proactive by investing in renewable energy projects like Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation in Tasmania. We are getting on with the job of delivering our plan to make Australia stronger.</span>

I want to start with a few factsâsomething foreign to those opposite. The IPCC has already found that the world has warmed by one degree Celsius, compared to preindustrial times. Since 1998, we've had five mass bleachings of the Great Barrier Reef, and the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were the warmest years on record. In fact, we have the highest greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in 800,000 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is occurring, and it poses probably the greatest security threat to the planet and certainly to Australia. That was set out in a seminal speech by the Chief of the Defence Force a couple of months ago, where he highlighted the fact that natural disasters are increasing in number, severity and range. For example, Cook Islands, once considered outside the main cyclone belt, experienced five cyclones in one month. Diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are on the rise in PNG. We are seeing an increase in sea temperatures and winds pushing tuna stocks westward, stocks which are critical to the economic livelihood of many Pacific nations. The greatest example was around the Syrian civil war, where the great drought between 2006 and 2011âwhich was caused by climate change, according to scientistsâpushed 1.5 million Syrians into cities, ramping up pressure on an already precarious political system. In the next 10 years, scientists think that we'll see another half a degree of global warming, which will lead to food scarcity, displaced populations, disease spreading, a doubling of species extinctions and sea levels half a metre higher. In fact, the CDF highlighted the fact that 81 million people will be negatively affected by changes to crop yields, several hundred million people will be driven into poverty and a quarter of a billion people will not have access to adequate drinking water. All this is obviously a catastrophe for the planet and will lead to an increase in conflict. This is especially relevant in Australia, given that we live in the most disaster-prone region in the world. The waters of the central Pacific are currently rising four times faster than the global average and this is obviously causing more flooding, erosion, inundation of living areas and contamination of aquifers and arable land. Again, most of these statistics are not drawn from some environmental group; these stats are drawn from a speech by the Chief of the Defence Forceâa Chief of the Defence Force held in the highest esteem by both sides of politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have chosen to concentrate on this because anyone who professes to care about our national security should care about fighting climate change and should care about making sure Australia makes an appropriate contribution to the global fight on climate change. I would submit that, for all their professed interest in national security, those on the other side are betraying our national security, as well as betraying future generations, by their attitude to climate change evident in an inadequate target, which they won't even meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just about national security; it's also about economic opportunities. For example, the University of New South Wales's technology around solar PV cells is resident within 60 per cent of PV cells around the world. Yet we didn't get a single job out of that innovation because John Howard and his government were so anti renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a massive opportunity here. We can be an energy exporting superpower through direct export of electricity to South Asia and South-East Asia and through the export of hydrogen to places like Japan and Korea. We have the highest solar radiation of any continent in the world and we've got great wind and wave resources. So, when the world transitions to renewable energy, which is inevitably occurring, we can again be the land of energy-intensive manufacturing. That's a great opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a great opportunity around the key inputs to renewable energy. We're the second-largest producer of rare earths. We have the greatest reserves of iron and titanium. We've got the second greatest reserves of copper and lithium and the third greatest reserves of silver. These are great opportunities for our mining sector. In fact, it takes 200 tonnes of coking coal to make one wind turbine. So there are even good opportunities for our coking coal sector around the transition to renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whether it is from a national security point of view or from an economic opportunity point of view, we need to declare a climate emergency and we need to take urgent action, unlike those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  In speaking on this motion, I'm going to start with some tongue-in-cheek comments. This issue is 'so important' to those opposite. Let us count how many there are here. Well, there were five but now there are fourâone, two, three, four. I think there is one coming back. I am not sure whether the member is returning. We could get to five people on the other side. It is 'so important' to those opposite that they declare a climate emergency that they haven't even filled the opposite side of the chamber! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Matt Killoran is up in the press gallery, and I also note his story on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span> site today, talking about the former member for Herbert, Cathy O'Tooleâwho has managed to find her spine on this issueâand former Labor Party member and Mayor of Rockhampton, Margaret Strelow, who have come out and said that the Labor Party has got it wrong. Let me count the ways! Once again, I take this motion with a grain of salt, to be honest. If those opposite were serious, they would all be hereâevery single one of them would be in the chamber. So this is, at worst, a stunt and, at best, a way to fill some space in this morning's program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite were serious about this, if it is a climate emergency, then everything should be on the tableâeverythingâand we shouldn't just be ruling things in and out because we like them or we don't like them. That means that you should consider nuclear energy. That means that you should consider HELE coal. If a HELE coal power station can reduce emissions by 40 per cent, why wouldn't you use it? Why wouldn't we go to another country and take their biggest emitting industries and move them to Australia, cut them in half, improve the world's outcome and create more jobs? But it seems that's off the table too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say that I have missed one opposition member. There is an extra opposition member over here who I didn't count previously. There are six here in the chamber. So my apologies to the Labor Party; there are six here for this debate. So, if everything is on the table for the climate emergency, that's the end of snowmakers. There will be no more of those; they run on diesel. We'll certainly have to stop using aircraft. So we will have to move parliamentary sittings and come here for a longer period of time, as there will be no more aircraft. There will also be no more cars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in all seriousness, if we are to look at this issue properly, we need to consider what our contribution is. That is what we on this side of the House, the government, have done. We have put forward a proportional response to our contribution. We have put up a balanced approach to what we are doing in terms of the environment. When we look at what happened in the last election, we know the outcome: the people agreed with us. The people agreed with us, because they were terrified of what the opposite side would do. Those opposite had a completely uncosted policy. This was identified by Jonathan Lee at a press conference, when the then Leader of the Opposition simply couldn't answer the question: 'How much will your policy cost, Mr Shorten?' If you cannot put forward a costed policy to the Australian people they will not support you. It is that straightforward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not represent working people anymore. That is the reality of where we are at. If we look at what happened in Queensland, rusted-on Labor voters walked away from the opposition in droves. They know that it happened. I know that it happened. We know the outcome. We know what happened in terms of the election. But, to be honest, I think it's a great shameâI really doâbecause the Labor Party used to be the party of working people. They are now the party of slogans. Where do you go from the climate emergency? Does it become a climate crisis? Do we wind it back and say, 'It's not quite as bad as we thought it was, so we'll wind it back a little bit more'? Once again we find ourselves here talking about another stunt around the climate emergency. As I said during this speech previously, I haven't seen a single member come in. I don't see the Labor Party tearing in to support their colleagues on the PMB. I don't see any of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, if you are out there representing working people, stop telling them you'll take away their jobs, because that is exactly what they are concerned about. They are concerned about losing the roles that they have now. Their priority is to pay their bills, be employed, ensure they can send their kids to school and work their way through what they do in life. On this side of the parliament, we are representing them. We are here in their interests, not those on the other side. We hear a lot of noise and a lot of sloganeering and we see lots of people with stunts and who are holding up traffic and, once again, I'd say to those in Extinction Rebellion: there will be no glue for you if there is a climate emergency; we simply can't produce any. Every single time we bring forward stunts like this, you depreciate the value of your position. If you really want to support climate change work and what we are doing around the environment, put forward a practical approach. Tell us what it is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I am proud to be standing here today speaking on this motion put by my colleague the member for Hindmarsh to declare a climate emergency. It is a mark of Labor's commitment to future generations. As he said, we owe it to our kids and our grandkids to stand up for their future and to fight for real action on climate change. As one of my staunch Cooper activists, Jane Morton, said, 'Declaring the emergency is not just a matter of token words; it is the start of a whole new frame of mind.' From young kids in Northcote to grandmas in Reservoir to doctors, nurses, tradies and scientists, our community knows our earth is experiencing a climate emergency, and they want something done about it now. Unfortunately, while the rest of the world has accepted that global warming is perfectly clear, it is not a priority for all of us in this place. Those who sit opposite are collectively burying their heads in the sand, with no desire or political courage to start to repair the damage that global warming is inflicting on our planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report calls for drastic action to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees of warming this century. The report starkly and graphically outlines the world we face, with the prospect of exceeding a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise by 2040âand that is not too far away. At 1.5 degrees, we lose between 70 and 90 per cent of the world's warm coral reefs on top of what we've lost to date. There will be more extreme hot weather, more extreme droughts. At 1.5 degrees, we will see the consequences of climate related risks to our health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, national security and economic growth. This change will disproportionately affect those living in developing countries and those in the Pacific, our neighbours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC is not some radical body. Their most recent report was written by 91 climate experts and cites 6,000 peer-reviewed papers. They are often considered to be too conservative in their warnings. As the member for Hindmarsh said, none of us should fall for the idea that is often spouted by commentators and, unfortunately, some on the other side of the House that what Australia does doesn't matter in this debate. Yes, we are a small nation. We don't even rate in the top 50 of the world's nations in population, but we rate in the top 15 in the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted. We are a wealthy nation that has, along with other members of the OECD, grown wealthy on the back of long-term industrialisation. We are the highest per capita producer of greenhouse gases. If Australia won't act to take responsible, strong action on climate change, which nation on the face of the planet should be expected to act?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government had a plan, a real plan, Australia could be leading the way to mitigate this climate emergency. With certainty instead of chaos, we could be encouraging clean energy production, sustainable industries and investment in jobs and the growing renewable economy. This has been Labor's mantra for a long time. We are committed to tackling climate change and transitioning our economy, and to still support all communities by providing decent, secure work. I stand with the millions of Australians who are committed to the cause of hope which is made possible by climate action. Hope for a just world, a fair world, a sustainable planet and the reshaping of our economy to meet its challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by giving a big shout-out to the many activists in Cooper who have been pushing for a climate emergency declaration for so long: all the Cooper students and protesters who marched at the climate rallies; the kids who sign and send me petitions and beautiful pictures every day; DCAN, Darebin Climate Action Now, for asking the member for Hindmarsh the hard questions at the many climate forums we've had; and CAHA, Darebin City Council, Newlands Parents for Climate Action, the Darebin ACF, Cooper GetUp!, Newlands Friends of the Forest, Doctors for the Environment, beyond zero emissions; and so many hundreds of individuals who have written, called and stopped me in the street to talk about this important issue. We are standing here today because of your hard work. This is your achievement. My commitment to all of you is to keep up the fight for climate action. We stand here to deliver the strongest possible targets for a real response to tackling the climate emergency. These are not just words; these are not token words. It is about changing the trajectory of this planet and keeping it sustainable to have a sustainable future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  It is extremely important to debate this motion in this chamber, because it reflects a fundamental discussion the Australian community is having about the future of our natural environment, our care and concern for it, and how this government is taking sensible, proportionate, practical measures to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions with the sanction and support of the Australian people, consistent with the proposition that we took to the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, because we're talking about a transition of the economyâa transition that will occurâto reduce our CO2 footprint and equivalent greenhouse gases, and the fact that there are trade-offs, it is fundamentally a discussion about how we're going to take Australians forward and not leave people behind. More critically, it is a discussion about trustâtrust that governments will honour the positions they take to the public at election. The objective of this motion is to break that trust by declaring something, and if it's seriousâand Labor and other members present who support this motion are seriousâre-orientate the entirety of the Australian economy and society towards a singular purpose. We do this from time to time. We do it in times of war. We do it when the threat posed is so immediate and extreme that every single other concern goes out the window. If Labor are not honestly putting forward that proposition and backing it up with policy, then it's a dishonest motion. So, no matter which way you deal with it, it's an issue around trust. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we support this motion, we are turning on the Australian people and showing contempt for them and their concerns, for their livelihood, their jobs and their interests. We face a situation where the Australian Labor Party are showing contempt for the voters of Australiaâand they do so because, at every point, the opposition has sought to do one thing on the issue of climate change and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, which is to trade on the trust from the Australian people and make ridiculous allegations about what is and isn't being done. Of course, we know full well that trust is not an issue that the opposition cares much for. After all, we do remember where the 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' ended up, and they're continuing to do that in the way they approach this issue, because we've seen that their rhetoric does not match their action. Only last week, the International Monetary Fund released a report saying that even if we were to go down the path that the Labor Party or the Greens want us to, you would need a carbon tax in excess of US$75, more than A$111. Let them get up here now and argue that that's what they want and that that's what they will support in this chamber right now. Of course, we know they won't, because this is a dishonest motion. We know they won't, because it doesn't enjoy the support of the Australian people. We know they won't, because it's actually not sustainable policyâby the way, that was the start, not the end. We know it won't actually deliver the sustainable transition for the Australian economy that this nation needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we, the government, took clear policy proposals to the last election. Twice we have gone to an election saying we will support and honour our targets under the Paris agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions between 26 and 28 per cent, and we are doing so. We have massive investment in major new base load energy generation in this country, whether it's the extension of the Snowy Hydro project or connecting more of the surplus wasted energy provided over to the Australian mainland. To take lectures from the Greensâlet's not forget who the Greens are: a political party founded on opposing investment in renewable energy in Tasmania. We are doing everything we can with the trust of the Australian people. What the Labor Party and the Greens want us to do is break that trust. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Not one. The member for Goldstein walks out right now, and he needs to be very, very careful in this debate because Goldstein is the seat that borders Macnamara. I know those people in Goldstein care about the future of our planet. They care about how our emissions are going up. They will hold the member for Goldstein responsible along with this government which doesn't have a plan to reduce our emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start in this really important motion put forward by the member for Hindmarshâand I commend the previous speakers on this side of the House, who have all made thoughtful contributions to this debateâwith some facts on the table. Climate change is a man-made problem and it will continue to have devastating consequences for Australia and our Pacific neighbours. We need to reduce our carbon emissions as part of a concerted global effort to keep our temperature rises well below two degrees and towards 1.5 degrees, the pre-industrial levels. Another fact we have today is that our emissions are going up. They are going up, as they have done every year since 2014. This is part of the government's own figures, which confirm it every time they are released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crazy thing about this debate is that climate change is a problem, but it also presents real opportunities. I was a young staffer here and I remember vividly the day that Joe Hockey goaded the car industry to leave this country. It was a devastating day, especially for the people in my electorate who, for years and years, worked in the factories in Fishermans Bend. It was a devastating day for the people of Geelong in the Ford factory. Yet they scoffed when we brought an electric vehicle policy to the last election. When they goaded the car industry to leave this country, they didn't just end the jobs of manufacturing workers; they ended the jobs of high-skilled engineers, of scientists, of researchers, of developers and of all the subsidiary businesses. Yet they scoff at a policy that could potentially bring manufacturing back to our electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are more and more isolated. Across the states, we have seen the state governments move towards net zero emissions by the middle of the century, as well as bring in complementary policies. In the great state of Victoria, where we have seen a Labor government now re-electedâI had the privilege of working and playing a small part in itâpolicies include net zero emissions by 2050 and a renewable energy target. In that same Ford factory where those opposite goaded companies to leave our shores, they are now producing wind turbines. Manufacturing jobs are returning to our cities and to our towns on the back of renewable energy jobs. It's exciting, yet the only people who have no plan, who don't accept the science, who don't want to take action, are those opposite. I know that there are a sprinkling of people over there who like to make platitudes, but they need to be very careful because platitudes simply aren't going to cut it. They need a plan to reduce our carbon emissions. The last person to have an energy policy was Malcolm Turnbull, and we all know where that went.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite: I know the Prime Minister has a genuine affection for those in the Pacific regionâI know he does; he talks about it oftenâbut you cannot look our Pacific island friends in the eye when they come to us pleading with Australia to take climate change seriously, pleading with our government to do something to reduce emissions. Fiji, Samoa, Tuvalu, PNGâclimate change is an existential threat to these countries, and the best our Prime Minister can do when he's in New York, when the international climate change conference is on, is skip the conference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is an opportunity for us to create jobs in this country, to create renewable energy jobs, to create a boom. There's investment, but we can make it better. Climate change is our responsibility, as responsible global citizens and as friends to our Pacific neighbours, to take seriously. I commend the motion put forward by the member for Hindmarsh. We are in a climate emergency, and we need to take it seriously.</span>

It reflects many of the others on that side over the past half hour or so; once again, high on rhetoric but with no solutions. The important thing is it's actually this government that is taking this seriously. It is this government that has made it very clear, in the recent election on 18 May, that it is going to honour its international commitments with respect to reducing emissions and dealing with the impacts of a changing climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we do take this seriously for any number of reasons, least of all the impact on our economy if we don't take seriously the impacts of the changing climate. This is what the government is actually doing. We're working across the community and across the various levels of government to put in place practical solutions to manage these risks. We're working towards developing and implementing through investments: an investment of some $24 million over the six years from 2014-15 to the National Environmental Science Program and Climate Change Hub; some $255 million over the 10 years from 2015-16 to enhance Australia's Antarctic capabilities; another $6.1 million over the three years from 2018-19 to provide the electricity sector with improved climate and extreme weather information; and another $25 million in 2019-20 towards the establishment of the National Centre for Coasts, Environment and Climate at Point Nepean. It is these investments that are the key to ensuring that we manage the impacts of a changing climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More locally, I have seen the benefits of work that has been done over many years through planting additional trees and revegetating our local communitiesâimprovements in water quality and improvements in the built environment. It is these practical solutions that we believe are going to help achieve the goals that we need to achieve. We all agree in this place that we need to leave the planet and the environment in a better place than when we found it. In addition, we can look at the investments in clean energy across the country not just at a national level but from some of the state governments as well. In 2018, an estimated $13.2 billion was invested in clean energy technologies in Australia, and this builds on the estimated $10 billion invested in 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I go around my electorate, there are a number of businessesâand the number increases by the dayâwhose focus is on recycling and improving how we use our wasteâthat we don't just dump it into landfills, that we're able to recycle that waste and reuse it. Doing that ensures that we don't deplete our natural resources as much as we otherwise would. It is these practical outcomes that we are seeing every day in electorates right across this country. Recently we announced a $6 million investment with Logan City Council in one of our waste water treatment facilities to treat solid waste by burning it at high temperatures to create biochar. It is a range of those examples that we're implementing, as well as meeting our emissions reduction targets, as we've committed to through the Paris Agreement, and they will deliver on our commitments to manage the impacts of a changing climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, one of the things that we do need to do is ensure that we have a strong and robust economy so we have the funds to manage these impacts and pay for the new investments and new technologies that are going to be developed over the coming five, 10, 15 or 20 years that will help further mitigate and deal with these issues. But it is these practical outcomes, these practical investments right across our economy, that this government is undertaking because of its strong economic management and foresight to deal with the issues of a changing climate.</span>

Raechel McKinnon, a year 8 student from Merici College here in Canberra wrote this speech for me last week in Girls Takeover Parliament. If the government won't listen to the Labor Party, I call on them to listen to the next generation, whose future is at stake if we don't take action now.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As her representative here in this place, I support climate action and the declaration of a climate emergency by this parliament. As you see, in spite of what the Prime Minister says, the youth of today are not relaxed and comfortable. They are engaged and informed, and they are anxious for action on climate change because they know our future depends on it. They know what is at stake. The Prime Minister will not make the facts go away by simply dismissing them. Australia must transform the way that we do things in order to stay below a two-degree increase in global temperatures and must make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. To do this, we must get to zero emissions by 2050. It is incumbent on us in this place to take action now so that future generations might be given a fighting chance. Labor will continue to fight for real action on climate change from this government. I support this declaration today of a climate emergency. I am proud to represent the activists in my electorate, who will also keep up the fight because they understand what is at stake.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many year 12 students in our electorates, the school year is now drawing to a close, with final exams either underway or due to begin shortly. These students, the majority of them born in 2001 and 2002, are post-millennial, sometimes known as the iGen or gen Z. For the majority of young people growing up across Australia, they have never known a world without Pixar movies, Harry Potter, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hunger Games</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Twilight</span>, the internet, Google, social media or selfies. They have engaged with the old Marvel versus DC debate and the new <span style="font-style:italic;">Minecraft</span> phenomenon and lived the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fortnite</span> phaseâthe less said about that, the better! Just like Harry, Hermione and Ron in the Harry Potter series and Frodo in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span>, our year 12s across the country are about to leave a stage of their life which, whether they've enjoyed it or not, has become very familiar to them. They are about to embark on their own adventures. They may not be battling Voldemort or having to return a ring on Middle Earth, but the exam period can be extremely stressful and daunting for them and their loved ones. The endless 'What are you going to do with the rest of your life?' questions can be overwhelming. It's understandable that our year 12s across the country will be feeling adrenaline and a mix of emotionsâenthusiasm, excitement, anxiety and some trepidation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the school leavers across the country, but particularly the 2,500 or so in my electorate of Curtin, I say the following: these exams are important, but you owe it to yourself, your family and your school to do your best. But also remember, just as Harry Potter thought the Sorting Hat was the be-all and end-all of the world when he first went to Hogwarts, he soon realised that it didn't determine his life for all time. So too are these exams important, but they do not determine who you are, your worth or your dignity. All of you have a special purpose, special gifts and talents. You may not know what your path in life is at this particular moment, and there may be a number of times that you change that path, but always remember that you have a purpose. Learn from the past and prepare for the future, but make sure you live in the present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, as someone who is passionate about education and with a personal investment in this year's final year 12 exams through my eldest son, I note the following: we have an excellent education system in Australia. We have passionate and dedicated teachers, we have excellent facilities and we have a shared understanding across all levels of government, across all political parties, that education is vitally important at an individual and at a societal level both for the here and now and for the future of our country. As excellent as it is and as shared as we may all be in understanding the importance of education, we can always do better. It is the role of government to continue to look at ways of improving the system and improving outcomes. On particular strategies we may disagree in this chamber but, to me, that is a sign that our educational system is working and that our country is healthy and vital. We have the capacity and the knowledge to review, innovate, assess and implement, and we have the freedom to debate and disagree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is demonstrating its commitment to excellence in education through this year's budget, a record $21.3 billion investment in funding for state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year and a record $17.7 billion investment in the university sector in 2019. A number of new strategies include a $525 million investment to strengthen the VET sector through a skills package and a revamp of the VET sector to ensure our VET sector is accessible, of high quality and responsive to what industry needs. The $30.2 million Local Schools Community Fund to assist schools to undertake small, identified and prioritised projects will be of benefit to the local school community. There are more but I will stop there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of finishing, I congratulate our government for backing our students by ensuring we have the best options and resources available to them. I acknowledge and thank our dedicated school leaders and teachers, who support, motivate and guide our students throughout their years at school. My particular thanks go to the teachers in my electorate of Curtin. Finally, to the school leavers in my electorate: I wish you all the best over the coming months. In the words of Dumbledore: it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I begin by thanking the member for Curtin for moving this motion in the House todayâwell, at least the first part of the motion. I completely and utterly support the opportunity to wish year 12 students across the country, across the great state of Victoria and those year 12 students in my electorate, those in the VCAL program who have already finished their final year of school and are out in the world as we speak, planning and seeking their future, and those undergoing the VCE exams over the next few weeks luck. We all know in this place the importance of education. We know on this side of the House the transformative power of education. I'm fortunate to have taught for 27 years in state schools in Victoria, and have had Labor governments that understood the importance of kids finishing school, of people going the whole road for 13 years of education in Victoria and the fact that that final year of school can make the difference in someone's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In completing that final year of school, we have changed the state of Victoria. It has meant that we have now surpassed the 80 per cent target set many, many years ago and are close to reaching 90 per cent retention rates in Victoria. I want to say to all of the students going into exam period: I wish you well, I wish you luck. I would say to you the key to examination performance is to stay calm and to remember that, ultimately, we're not testing you; we're testing the system. I want say to the teachers who have taught year 12s this year: thank you for raising your hands to be the people who do that ultimate year in education. Having taught VCE English myself for many, many years, it is a big year. There is an enormous amount of work. I want to thank you for the corrections, I want to thank you for the feedback and I want to thank you for creating an environment where the school-assessed tasks are done in a relaxed way. I want to thank you for every time you took the time out to get a student back on track, to give that little bit of conversation that might motivate a student. I want to thank you, in particular, for the referrals you made to the welfare teams in your schools, when you thought something was awry with a student, this year and every other year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well, students completing year 12 is a culmination of all of their teachers' work across the 13 years of formal school educationâand, might I say, the work of preschool and early-education educators as well. It is a test of our system, and I want to thank everyone who works in that system, from the school support people to the teachers to the administrators in schools, and particularly the principal class in schools, as well as what we in Victoria call our senior teamsâpeople who spend their lives managing a group of students in the senior years of school to ensure that they are supported to make the most of the opportunities that are before them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak to the second part of this motion, where it goes to the great work of this government, and I just want to say to those opposite, particularly those who have joined us in recent times: when we came here after the 2013 election, there was a $30 billion cut carried in the 2014 budget. So, whenever you say 'record spending', you need to remember that cut. You need to remember wholeheartedly that most of the VCE students in this country, most of the year 12 students in this country, attend state schools, and you need to be very clear on the fact that the government, for six years, have undermined the best opportunity we, as a Commonwealth, have had to ensure quality education for all students in all schools. Those opposite have actively undermined that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reminded this morning, when I walked past a television set to see Christopher Pyne, the former member for Sturt, on the television, who was responsible for that cut. I know who the minister was at the time who undermined the incredible work done by the previous parliament in the Gonski review. I remind members opposite that the Gonski review, in its original form, determined that state schools required the most funding from the Commonwealth, and those in this government have done nothing but undercut that. In fact, they've capped the contribution from the Commonwealth to the Schooling Resource Standard at 20 per cent. This is an absolute outrage. It undermines years and years of work in this place, to see us wound back to the happy Howard years where state schools became marginalised as private schools flourished in our suburbs. That's the legacy that this government should consider itself responsible forâthe undermining of a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver great, quality education for every student in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to speak about the importance of education and the efforts this government has taken to support and encourage students in their final weeks of year 12. It goes without saying that education is the key for fulfilling and successful careers. It provides individuals with the skills and expertise to become everything from teachers and surgeons to plumbers and astronauts. The diverse variety of jobs and careers in a modern economy like Australia's requires a diversity of education and training opportunities. It is important that the government supports all varieties of education, from traditional universities to vocational education and training such as TAFE, or even on-the-job training, and I'm proud to say that this government has done this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we consider the $17.7 billion allocated to the university sector in the 2019-20 budget, as well as the $525.3 million skills package committed to the VET sector, we see that this government makes substantial investments in our nation's higher education capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But tertiary and further education can only work effectively if individuals have a strong start in primary and high school. As any economist could tell you, the strongest impact of education is made in the early years of schooling, when students are developing the core critical thinking and reasoning skills necessary for any profession. It is vital that this part of our education pipeline is as effective as possible. Over the 13 years of schooling from kindergarten to grade 12, young Australians all around the country gain a world-class education in a variety of subjects, spanning languages, maths, English, technology, sport and countless extracurricular activities. However, the quality of this system should not be taken for granted. It requires commitment, hard work and extensive funding for it to be possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that this government has stepped up to the challenge of making Australia's education system the best it possibly can be. This government has invested a record $21.3 billion for state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year, an increase in funding of $8.5 billion since 2013. In addition, we have funded $30.2 million in the 2019-20 years to establish the Local School Community Fund, which is to support priority projects in local schools that will benefit schools and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to highlight some of the local work I've been doing in my electorate to foster and encourage education for our children. As Australia's economy becomes more complex we will rely more and more on sectors that use science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM skills, as they are more commonly known. It is therefore essential that we foster STEM skills in our community, not simply through traditional classroom learning but also through applied problem-solving and real-life scenarios. In 2016 I began the Bennelong STEM Challenge in order to provide students in the electorate with another opportunity to develop their STEM teamwork and interpersonal skills. Each year the STEM challenge sets up a complex STEM related problem and asks students to solve it. Last year it was designing a medical station for the surface of Mars, using 3D modelling software. It was hosted by Medtronic and led by the exceptional Dr Michael Myers from Re-Engineering Australia. Dozens of students created complex and ingenious designs, then came together for competition day, when they presented their designs using virtual reality software. It was a tremendous success. This year, the STEM challenge is back and I'm very excited to see what our students will develop this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the STEM challenge, I'm currently in the process of designing a Bennelong chess challenge with our local schools. Chess is a wonderful sport. It develops critical and strategic thinkingâboth are assets that are used in many different aspects of school and the workforce. It is not just an enjoyable pastime but also has great educational benefits. We are hoping to provide chess resources to every school in Bennelong, along with a single competition day for students to learn from each other and to test their abilities. I greatly look forward to seeing this project get underway next year. It is interesting to note that this came about as a result of our multicultural community. Learning chess is a mandatory extracurricular activity in Armenia, and Armenians are the great champions. This is another real example of multiculturalism at its best.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for her speech. As a former vice-chancellor, she knows well the importance of education in this country and I concur with her in wishing our students the very, very best of luck and in congratulating the teachers, whose fine work has got them to this stage. As an Independent, I see it as my role to be an honest and fair voice on the issues that matter to my electorate, to recognise good work where it's done and to call on the government where more work is needed, particularly for Australians in regional areas. People living in remote, rural and regional Australia have much lower education outcomes than our city cousins. This is nothing to do with our capacity to learn and everything to do with our opportunity to do so. It is completely unacceptable that this is so in a modern Australia with a projected federal budget surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural Australians are less likely to complete year 12, less likely to gain a certificate IV, or above, qualification, more likely to have to leave home for an education, and less likely to apply for and accept a university offer. As someone who grew up on a farm in rural Victoria, let me say that I know what impact drought has on a young person's expectations as to how high they can aim. Whether there is money around to leave home and go to university or whether we should leave school and try to get a jobânever underestimate the message young kids in the country subliminally receive when their parents are struggling to manage the ravages of prolonged drought on the family income. The government's recent strategy in rural and regional education, the Napthine report, identifies clear barriers that hold country people back. We should move swiftly, for instance, on the first three recommendations of that report: uncap places at regional universities; develop new, innovative VET offerings focused on practical learning and technical skills; and expand the Regional Study Hubs program to give all students, VET and university, access to high-quality learning spaces with world-class internet. In short, we need to do more to introduce our young people to opportunities for education, provide them with pathways to succeed and connect them to jobs that our regions are thirsty for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mansfield Secondary College in my electorate of Indi is doing precisely this kind of innovation. Commencing in 2009, Mansfield Secondary developed an agriculture and horticulture training program for year 9 students, integrated into the school's curriculum. The program addressed the need for a sustainable agricultural workforce by recruiting year 9 students into agricultural careers by organising field trips to farms and offering enrolment in VET cert II courses offered by a local TAFE provider. What is now known as the Mansfield model was a huge success: 98 per cent of participants completed that certificate II; of those, 27 per cent successfully transitioned into completing a cert III or IV, some of which led to university courses in agriculture via school based apprenticeships and traineeships. In fact it was such a success that it has spawned the workforce development project which is expanding the Mansfield model to 24 locations across the Ovens Murray region in the coming years. It has also been expanded to address another critical skills shortage in health care and social assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project is supported by wonderful local organisations like the NE Tracks Local Learning and Employment Network, which supports young people and works with schools to achieve higher rates of education attainment in Benalla, Wangaratta and Mansfield. This program came to pass not because the government or the private sector made it happen but because of local creativity and hard work. Julie Aldous, a local secondary teacher, instigated the Mansfield model in 2009. She is now leading an industry and government backed push to expand the original agriculture focus of the model into health and horticulture. Lucy Wallace, a committee member with the Albury Wodonga Health Community Advisory Committee, has joined this push into the health sector to address our immediate and urgent needs for healthcare workers in the north-east. Sue Brunskill, from the National Industry Reference Committee for horticulture and conservation, has been actively engaging local and national horticultural businesses as they consider the model's employment and study success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing the life chances for kids in the country means we need to elevate and expand on these brilliant initiatives that are already taking place. A place to start would be to implement the recommendations of the government's own regional education strategy. The government committed in this election campaign to develop a study hub in Wangaratta, and I will be pushing for this to be delivered, along with the rest of the regional education strategy, to ensure that all regional Australians get an equal shot at opportunities that education offers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I rise in support of this motion. As you know, the coalition government was at the forefront of the increased funding to all schools across the Australian states and territories. In the time of Menzies in the 1960s the Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn closed the school because of the requirements to upgrade their toilet blocks and the facilities for the students. As he marched the schoolchildren up the main street, people all of a sudden had a lightbulb moment and thought, 'Gee, if all these non-government schools close, the government schools will be flooded with children.' Hence at the time there was federal coalition government support for Catholic and other non-government schools in the form of science blocks, and it has gone on from then. For decades, state governments have funded and run free public education. From the 1850s and 1860s, when government schools exploded around the then colonies, Australia has had an exemplary record in funding things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the coalition government, in the recent so-called funding wars, have really stumped up and increased funding to all levels of school. The most formative period of one's education is that very first part. We have a situation now where there is guaranteed funding for 15 hours of preschool, including support for child care. And we are putting pressure on the states to make sure that the funding results in the children actually attending that preschool and early school preparation work, because if they're not ready for school when they get into kindergarten or their first year at school, they don't thrive as well. We've put enormous amounts of extra money into child care. We've made it much more efficient; the funding goes straight to the day care or the childcare centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the school space, all of the schools in the Lyne electorate have received extra funding. There were no problems in my part of Australia. All the government schools got a better deal out of the federal coalition government, and so did all the non-government schools. But, as the member for Indi pointed out, regarding achievement at the tertiary level, whether in trade skills development or in higher education at universities, regional Australia hasn't done nearly as well. Many of the views she referred to, I thoroughly agree with. The inhibition to achieving a tertiary or a vocational qualification in regional Australia is different. The challenges are different. The tyranny of distance really plays into it, just as much as the low general income, because it's the barrier to travelling away for either apprenticeship training or for a university degree. It's the costs involved; it's not the actual education fees. People can't really aspire if it means relocating to a regional or major metropolitan centre. If your children are relocating to a major metropolitan centre, you are up for about $25,000 when you put together housing, travel and relocation, even for distances as small as 50 or 100 kilometres. It means they don't aspire to it, because it's not in their area. That's why these regional university centres that the minister is rolling out, in the next round, are so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, there are pockets where there is low achievement in the tertiary education space: in the Manning and down into the Upper Hunter regions. We had 42 new apprentices delivered into the marketplace courtesy of our subsidy trial program. In the second round, we had another 30. That's roughly 70 new apprentices in the Lyne electorate alone that are there because of the support that we in the coalition government have given them. These regional university centres are a great initiative, and I'm looking forward to support from the government in any application that comes out of the Manning Valley region, which I've spoken about in this House already. It is a really critical thing because it brings tertiary education into the here and now, into the financially possible space if it's delivered locally in a mixed modality fashion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity today to talk about the government's record on education. Education is something I am passionate about for many reasons, but largely because of the many wonderful students I have spent time with over the years. I want to start by also acknowledging the hard work that all year 12 students on the New South Wales South Coast have put in over their years of schooling. I wish them the very best of luck in their exams and in whatever path they may choose to take next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the pleasure of attending graduation ceremonies at Kiama High School, Nowra Anglican College and TAFE's IPROWD students. I went along to the Clontarf Foundation academy's opening at Vincentia High School. This week I am very excited to welcome school students from Callala and Moruya public schools to Parliament House. I look forward to seeing them later in the week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always love talking with students about their hopes and dreams for the future. I would also agree wholeheartedly with this motion that the work of teachers is invaluable. Teachers are invested in their students. They live the highs and the lows with them. They want to see them succeed and they push themselves hard to help their students reach their full potential. That is why I am so passionate on this topic. I used to be a TAFE teacher. I was invested in the students in my outreach classes. I was invested in my students in my pre-apprenticeship courses. I was invested in them all, and I still am. That is why I can talk passionately about the government's record on education but not the record the member for Curtin wants us to believe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have cut $14 billion from schools. They have cut $3 billion from TAFE and training. Teachers are being asked to do more with less because of this government's record on education. Students are falling behind in reading, writing and maths because of this government's record on education. Schools are turning to GoFundMe pages to help them. Minnamurra Public School made an amazing video asking people to help them raise $14,000 for their new STEM lab. They wanted a STEMshare robotics kit, an iPad and a 3D printerâequipment to help them prepare for the jobs of the future. I think it is fantastic that the kids, their teachers and their parents put such great effort into this, but why should they have to?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, I committed an additional $400,000 to this school under Labor's schools plan. Under Labor, schools across my electorate would have been $21 million better off. But this government is not serious about properly funding education. The government is not serious about making sure children can reach their full potential. Students need the right equipment to gain the skills for 21st century jobs, otherwise they will be left behind. We need to have targeted investment in schools, but this government has starved our education system through its cruel cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what do young people in my electorate have to look forward to when they finish school? The highest youth unemployment rate in New South Wales, the lowest workforce participation rate in Australia, a 30 per cent drop in apprentice numbers from when this government was elected in 2013 until March 2018. That's not surprising. This is what happens when you cut all the pre-apprenticeship courses in our local TAFE campuses. When you remove the support for young people wanting to take up a trade and put your faith in celebrities rather than in funding, you cause a skills crisis, you end up with more apprentices dropping out of apprenticeships than finishing them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Year 12 students graduating this year have the world at their feet. They are full of potential and full of hope for the future. I want to see them succeed. I want to see them go to TAFE and university and get a good job. I want to see them follow their dreams. This government needs to start investing in their future now. They need to reverse the successive cuts that have ripped the guts out of our education system. They need to fix the mess they made of TAFE and apprenticeship courses. They need to re-establish pre-apprenticeship programs. They need to properly fund our schools so that no child has to turn to GoFundMe just to get the basic equipment they need. Our young people need the government to invest in them, and I will continue calling out the government on their record in education so that our kids can get the start in life they deserve.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  I'd like to thank and acknowledge my friend the member for Curtin, the distinguished former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Notre Dame, for moving this motion today. Let me also acknowledge the year 12 students in the Berowra electorate, who are preparing for life beyond the school gateâsome are preparing for university and others for vocational education, while some are moving into the workforce. I want to congratulate our HSC students on completing school and wish them well for their exams, and I want to say to all of them that we look forward to the many ways in which they'll contribute to the great future of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is investing more money in schools than any federal government in our history. We're doing this because we recognise that one of the most important differences any government can make to the future of our young people, no matter what their background, is to ensure they have a chance to learn and are equipped with the skills, knowledge and capacity to keep learning in the years ahead. But we also know that money alone does not create a great education system. No matter how much money we put into education, we can't change the fact that one of the most important factors in the quality of the education a child receives is the teacher a child learns from. Great teachers bring deep subject matter expertise combined with a passion for educating students and for the subjects they teach as well as the skills to manage the classroom and pass on their knowledge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to talk about an amazing organisation which has been funded by the Morrison government and its predecessors on both sides of the House and which is doing so much to bring outstanding people into the teaching profession, where they're improving student performance and changing lives. For the past 10 years this organisation has been quietly working to ensure more children can have the best possible teachers and to raise the status and quality of the teaching profession in Australia. Teach for Australia takes top graduates from a range of disciplines and puts them through a tailored masters of education while working in the classroom, where they are coached, mentored and supported by highly experienced teachers. It was an honour to serve on their board prior to my election to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, 800 highly talented Australians who are at the top of their field have chosen to teach because of Teach for Australia. Teach for Australia has shown some of the things we assume about the teaching profession are not necessarily true. Firstly, we assume top graduates don't become teachers because the pay is low, the work is hard and the status isn't high. That's not the case. Eleven thousand people have applied for the roughly 800 places Teach for Australia has filled. Teach for Australia has been ranked among the top 100 graduate employers in Australia. One Teach for Australia participant, Surajeev Santhirasegaram, left his burgeoning career in finance to move to Western Australia and teach high school maths and physics. He says he was motivated by work with a purpose. He loves being on the ground with students and wants to be creative and self-driven in his work. It seems that, for many people, teaching is an attractive pathway but investing the time and money in further education for a career you can't try before making that investment is a difficult obstacle to overcome. Teach for Australia provides a different pathway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we too easily assume that the best way to prepare a great teacher is to teach educational theory in lecture halls. The Teach for Australia model shows that learning in the classroom with high-quality professional development happening alongside can produce great results. In 2015, a survey of principals who had a Teach for Australia teacher in their school found that 80 per cent of principals said that Teach for Australia teachers were more or much more effective than typical graduates with the same level of experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, we assume that if someone can become a management consultant or investment banker, they will choose that over teaching. But the Teach for Australia retention stats show a different picture. Fifty per cent of Teach for Australia graduates remain in teaching three years on. This compares to about only one in four students who start an educational degree through traditional pathways who are still in teaching five years of graduation. The Morrison government is investing in Teach for Australia because it is game changing for the teaching profession and for the whole education system in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teach for Australia provides an avenue for some of our top students to pass their knowledge on to the next generation and it's building the status of the teaching profession. It allows us to think creatively and freshly about how we build educational quality in Australia. Each dollar we spend on Teach for Australia is a wise investment in the future of our nation. Teach for Australia graduates bring a growth mindset to our education system. They realise that, as the PISA results indicate, our education system isn't performing as it should be and we need to attract people into the teaching profession to achieve real change on the ground. That's what Teach for Australia graduates are doing every single day. I want to commend the outstanding Melodie Potts Rosevear, founding CEO of Teach for Australia, who has led it since its inception, and her team for their dedication to young people and I want to thank the government for their continued support of TFA.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Curtin recognising that, across the country, year 12 students will be completing their final exams and their last days as school students. I especially mention my godson, Alexander Crocker, who I know is listening, and wish him well in his exams and in his football career in the United Kingdom. The end of 13 long years of school is an exciting time for students and their parents. It can also be an anxious time. To the year 12 students in Moreton and everywhere, but especially in Moreton, students graduating from Yeronga State High School, Macgregor State High, Runcorn State High School, St Thomas More College, St Aidan's Anglican Girls' School, Corinda State High School, Brisbane Christian College, Sunnybank, Our Lady's College at Annerley, Milperra, the Murri School, Carinity Education and maybe some of those schools right on the border, such as Holland Park State High and the Islamic College: I encourage all of you to enjoy your last few days of school and, whatever your results, remember they alone won't define your journey through life. Whatever your next chapter holds, be it higher education, vocational education and training or entering the workforce, I wish you well. I would also ask you to take a moment, before you leave the school grounds for the last time, to thank staff and teachers. This can be a stressful time for them, and teachers, remember, have to go through this every single year; you only have to do it once. If there are one or two special teachers who have inspired you or supported you or held you up, please especially take a moment to let those teachers know. We have some exceptional teachers in our schools, and they don't always get the accolades or reward that they deserve. A kind word of gratitude from you will mean the world to that teacher. And also: buy them a gift.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's funny how, even when it's many years since you walked from the school grounds for the last time, you remember those teachers who managed to make that connectionâthe teachers who made the puzzle fit. I had many. One I will particularly mention was Lorna Locke, my grade 6 teacher. Lorna had also taught my very wild and unruly older brother Mark. Lorna actually took the time to teach me that learning is always a good use of my time, and that lesson has stuck with me my whole life. I bet most of us can't recall too many single lessons from our schooldays but we can remember those teachers who left a lasting impression. Likewise, from my 11 years of teaching high school English, there aren't many actual classes that I recall, but I do remember the faces of the students, especially the ones who left me feeling that our future would be in good hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers today have far more pressures than when I was in front of a blackboard. Households are under far greater financial stress, which can flow on to students. The internet makes teaching, and parenting, much more complicatedâand, sometimes, even dangerous. The students are under pressure to find a pathway in a world where the job market is changing rapidly, with the gig economy and so many other pressures. Most students who decide to go into higher education will be signing up for debt, and, thanks to the Morrison government, that debt now has to be repaid much sooner, making their chances of affording a home an unattainable dream for many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is transformation, but education costs moneyâmoney so schools can hire more teachers and teacher aides; money so struggling students can have the one-on-one attention they need to succeed. We need every child to be learning every day. We need children who are struggling to be identified early so they can obtain the help they need to catch up. We need children who are gifted and talented to have the opportunity to stretch themselves, because they will create the jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two-thirds of students in Australiaâ2Â½ million childrenâare educated at public schools. Under the Morrison government's funding regime, all private schools will reach or exceed their fair funding level. Good luck to them. But 90 per cent of public schools never, never will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is in its seventh year of presiding over Australia's education system. How are they doing? Well, let's prepare their report cardâbecause, sadly, I need to report that they're failing. They're failing to reverse the alarming declines in reading, writing and mathsâthe core business of education. In every state and territory, kids are going backwards in some of these critical areas of education. This is not just a tragedy for each of those students; it's a tragedy for the Australian economy. A good education is the ticket to a lifetime of opportunity, opening doors to rewarding and well-paid jobs, and an educated workforce is critical to a strong economy. Malcolm Turnbull abandoned proper, fair school funding. Tony Abbott dumped reforms designed to lift standards in the basicsâreading, writing and maths. Now, sadly, our kids and our economy, under Prime Minister Morrison's stewardship, are paying the price.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  For a week or two earlier this month, my Sunshine Coast office was the site of a production line that even BlueScope Steel would be proud of. Volunteers from all over my community came together to create my Fisher school leavers' guide. With only a hand-cranked binding machine and lots of community spirit, Fisher's volunteers put together 2,000 booklets to go out to all of our year 12s. My guide gives local students a great starting point to find out how to get information on further education, find somewhere to live, get a job and set up a life in the real world. I would encourage all of the students who received a copy this month to read it carefully, and to come back to it often in the critical months to come. Thank you to my dedicated volunteers, Julie Craig, John Pozzey, Helen Burke, Charmaine Roberts and Lyn Carden, who came in to help them get ready. My mission as a parliamentarian is to help make Fisher the place to be for education, employment and retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is the foundation of that vision, and that is why I am so pleased that this coalition government has delivered unprecedented support to my electorate for learning at every stage. For schools in Fisher, the government has delivered an additional $266 million to ensure every student has the resources necessary to flourish. Critically, we have combined that additional funding with a program of reform in teaching standards and approaches because we understand that money alone will never deliver the results that we need. However, the government acknowledges that a better built environment can support students' learning, and with millions of dollars through the government's Capital Grants Program I've had the privilege of opening fantastic new facilities at schools all over Fisher. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, I opened new classrooms, a recording studio, a drama and dance studio, new sports courts and a gym at Glasshouse Christian College. Supported by a grant of $1 million from the Capital Grants Program, these new facilities feature the cutting-edge technology and learning design so important for success in today's world. Recently, I visited Caloundra Christian College to view the results of the government's $880,000 investment in the school's new primary precinct. We helped deliver six new classrooms, places for art and play, and the functional facilities the precinct requires. Last year at Caloundra City Private School I opened a new multipurpose hall, a music classroom, a drama classroom, practice rooms, a stage and more, following a grant of $900,000 from the coalition government. In the weeks to come, I'm looking forward to joining Mr Peter Hovey and Bishop Paul Smith in opening Pacific Lutheran College's new administration buildings and classrooms, following their receipt of $600,000 from this education-focused government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of Fisher's year 12s will be going on to study at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Alongside funding for research into epilepsy, airport runway materials and mental health, this government has provided millions to USC in additional funding for our university students. Our funding for teaching and learning at USC increased from $165 million in 2017 to $172 million last year. This government is also providing USC with an additional $69.4 million over four years for their Moreton Bay campus and an additional $30.2 million to increase the number of bachelor students at their Caboolture and Fraser Coast campuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, too few of our year 12s will be on their way to an apprenticeship or other vocational education. I have spoken often about this in this placeâthat is, the importance of our tradies, and for young people to take on trades and to have a fulfilling and lucrative career. First-year rates of full-time employment for VET and university graduates, and their median salaries, are almost identical. Apprentices generate an income from day one, do not finish with a big burden of debt and, in the longer term, have the chance to start a business and work for themselves. The government understand that we need more skilled tradies, and we are investing to make it happen with an expanded Australian apprentice wage subsidy trial, with $156.3 million for a new additional identified skills shortage payment and $525 million in a new skills package. To all the students out there: do yourselves a favour and get a trade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I received confirmation in writing from the minister for trade confirming this government's commitment to the issues I have raised. I welcome the commitment, but it must be followed by action. Labor will hold the government to account on the commitments it has made and will work constructively to make sure that this happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this legislation because we understand the enormous benefits that trade has brought to Australia. We do so because we recognise the importance for a trading nation like ours in building closer economic and people-to-people relationships with our neighbours. Trade creates jobs. According to the independent Centre for International Economics, one in five Australian jobs depends on trade. That's 2.5 million workers whose livelihoods are directly linked to our engagement with the world, especially the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region on our doorstep. If we continue to reduce trade barriers, if we as a nation continue to advocate for an open, rules based global trading system, we will create more jobs for Australian workers. The result will be more competitive industries with a higher skilled, better-paid workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of our key industries rely on trade. Those with the highest percentage of export related jobs are in mining. Seventy-five per cent of mining jobs are export related, 43 per cent of agricultural jobs are export related, 38 per cent of metal product manufacturing jobs are export related, 28 per cent of jobs in food manufacturing are export related, and 31 per cent of transport and storage jobs are related to export trade. These are the people whom Labor represents: mineworkers, farm labourers, meatworkers, manufacturing workers, truck drivers, wharfies, airline industry workers, shop assistants, and storemen and packers. In addition, there are thousands of jobs in hospitality and transport that rely on tourism. As well, those in higher education and vocational education rely on the rapid growth in Australia's export of education services. Trade creates jobs for Australians. It also creates better jobs. A study by economists at the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science has found that Australian businesses that export will hire, on average, 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. However, Labor also recognises that we live in an era of increased scepticism about the impacts of globalism and free trade. We live in an era in which some world leaders have demonised free trade for their own domestic political purposes. In the US, the 'America First' slogan from the 1940s has been revived and the US President has lambasted his country's global engagement in the postwar era and pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, the Greens and One Nation have also used international trade as a weapon for their own electoral gains. If these parties choose to weaponise these agreements for short-term political gain, I hope they have the courage to explain their decision to the steelworkers of Port Kembla, to the wheat producers of Western Australia, to dairy farmers in Victoria and to the beef and sugar industries of Queensland. And, if Centre Alliance also chooses to politicise these agreements, what will they tell the Australian grain and wine industries? What will they say to South Australian workers in the copper mining and refining industry who will benefit from the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we know that trade has raised overall living standards in Australia, we also recognise that it has harmed workers in some industries and some regions. The benefits of trade are not always evenly spread, and it is understandable that those who feel left behind often question whether trade deals are more advantageous for big companies than for ordinary workers. So we must listen to what the community is telling us, and that is what we have been doing. We have consulted with stakeholders in the union movement, in industry, in academia and in government. After careful consideration, Labor has come to the conclusion that these three agreements, with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru, are in the national interest. But that doesn't mean they are perfectâfar from it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor is next in government, we will undoubtedly do things differently. I appreciate the concerns that have been raised by the ACTU and some of its affiliate unions with these agreements. I share these concerns. The federal parliamentary Labor Party shares these concerns. Labor wants to protect jobs and to improve working conditions for everyone. These are important aims, critical for the wellbeing and prosperity of Australian workers, especially at this time of slowing economic growth, record low wages growth and high youth unemployment. The Liberal-National government's appalling record of economic mismanagement has only exacerbated these problems for workers and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The union movement has stood up for the rights of Australian workers and has also played a leading role in highlighting the exploitation of foreigners who come to Australia to work on a temporary visa. We should have better safeguards in place to protect these vulnerable workers. Unfortunately, this government does not share Labor's belief in the need for a stronger industrial relations systems that protects all Australian workers regardless of their country of origin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions have long advocated for labour market testing when employers bring temporary skilled workers to Australia. I note, however, that there are no new labour market testing waivers in these trade agreements that go beyond the commitments Australia has already made to these three nations. All adhere to Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organization rules. But this was not the case when the coalition ratified the China-Australia free trade agreement in 2015. At that time, the trade union movement campaigned to protect labour market testing to ensure the safety and prosperity of Australian workers. This lobbying effort has resulted in a significant change. Australian government trade negotiators have maintained labour markets testing as a rule in all current and future arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without the advocacy of the labour movement in ensuring free trade agreements are fair for workers and maintain high standards, we would not have the robust safeguards that we see in the deals before the parliament. That does not mean, however, that concerns about protecting Australian jobs have been fully or adequately addressed. Labor is concerned that the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership could, in future, allow workers from Indonesia to enter Australia without due consideration as to whether local workers are able to full those positions. Under the terms of the IA-CEPA, Australia and Indonesia can begin talks within three years of a new agreement to allow increased numbers of Indonesian temporary workers to enter this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Labor members on the JSCOT committee that examined the IA-CEPA and other agreementsâand I also acknowledge the chair of the JSCOT committee, who is in the chamber. These Labor MPs sought to include a recommendation in the final report that a future agreement with Indonesia on this issue should include a commitment to labour market testing. Such a commitment would ensure that Indonesian workers meet the same standards as local workers. However, the JSCOT committee in the end did not support this recommendation and it was not included in its report. Again, I note the government's letter today and its commitment that people who come to work in Australia are not exploited and that they are properly qualified for any work that they undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the IA-CEPA, the number of working-holiday visas issued to young Indonesians will increase from the present level of 1,000 a year to 4,100âscaling up to 5,000 young Indonesians by the sixth year. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns that this could help to drive up unemployment in Australia. However, it is important to note that in 2017-18 a total of 210,456 working-holiday visas were issued in Australia and that Indonesia accounted for just 0.5 per cent of these. In contrast, there were almost 38,000 visa holders in this category from the United Kingdom. An additional 4,000 workers from Indonesia will equate to just 0.03 per cent of the national labour force. Nonetheless, there is a very real risk that these workers could be exploited, and the growth of the temporary workforce is fundamentally changing Australia as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two million people live and work here with no path to permanency and fewer rights than Australians. This country is at risk of creating a migrant underclass, and that is not what Australians want. Many people blame free trade, but the problem is wider than that. It includes our domestic industrial laws and the inadequate enforcement of those laws. It includes a failure to address the worker exploitation that the trade union movement brings to our attention regularly. I recognise the commitment of trade unions that are at the coalface when fellow humans are discovered living in appalling conditionsâheld hostage, their passports taken and often not paid by unscrupulous employers. All nations, including Australia, should be striving to meet their commitment to implement agreed international standards on labour rights, including the International Labour Organization's conventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was pleasing to see the treaties committee unanimously recommend that the government should conduct independent modelling of all proposed trade agreements to assess whether expected outcomes are being realised. This has long been Labor Party policy. This recommendation was supported during the JSCOT process by both the union movement and leading business groups, such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As the ACTU's Damian Kyloh told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We feel that for good policymaking it's very important that we conduct independent cost-benefit analysis, and not just of the economic effectsâwe'd also say environmental and, for us particularly, looking at the labour market. We want to understand what the effects on the labour market are in these agreements. We know that in the past some industries have benefited but some others have not and there have been job losses as a result. Without an independent economic assessment no-one knows what the effects are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to accept this recommendation and to implement a process through which independent economic modelling of proposed trade agreements can be undertaken, but I am far from confident this will occur, because the government has ignored all previous JSCOT recommendations on this issue. I note too that today's letter from the government does not have a commitment to economic modelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor calls on the government to ensure that any new free trade agreement is subject to an independent national interest assessment along with economic modelling before it is assigned. This assessment could examine the economic, strategic and social impacts of the agreement. It should be reviewed 10 years after ratification so the full impacts of a trade agreement are able to be assessed. In addition, we call on the government to ensure greater transparency in other areas, including updating the parliament and public after each round of negotiations, where that is possible. We'd also like to see a focused system of trade advisers, including from industry and unions, who will provide feedback and draft trade agreements during negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its most recent review of the world trading system, the Productivity Commission noted that higher-quality consultation processes with the community would help to achieve better outcomes for our trade and investment agreements. It found that confidentiality agreements could be used to enable formal consultation on draft treaty text with stakeholder parties during the negotiation process. It recommended that, when a draft agreement is completed, it should be exposed to public scrutiny before it is signed. This level of consultation would build a better appreciation of the choices and their respective pros and cons, combat perceptions that secrecy during negotiations leads to suboptimal outcomes for some members of the community and foster public confidence in open markets. More generally, the commission called for governments to better explain how and why the community benefits from trade liberalisation while recognising there sometimes will be members of the community who do lose out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes in greater transparency because we believe the whole community should be cognisant of facts in the discussion on international trade. Facts are importance to all decision-making and policy development processes. Just as Labor and the Australian people have called on the government to acknowledge the science of climate change, we want the facts on trade to be out in the open. It was for this reason that the previous Labor government conducted a scoping study into the full economic partnership with Indonesia, in conjunction with the Indonesian government. This was followed by independent economic modelling by the Centre for International Economics that indicated a potential IA-CEPA would result in gains of $3.2 billion of GDP to Australia. This modelling can give Australians confidence that the agreement will be of significant benefit to Australia and Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that a more contemporary analysis would provide even greater confidence. But, in the absence of this, we turn to other reputable sources. The recent report of the Productivity Commission, the Australian government's independent advisory body, found that the benefits of free trade for this country are wide-ranging. For example, every Australian business that uses a carâfrom tradies to taxi operators and driving schoolsâhas benefited from the large reduction in tariffs and quotas over the past decades. It's not just the price of cars that has fallen. Australian consumers see the benefits every day in terms of wider choices and lower prices. The prices of clothing, footwear and most electronic goods have also fallen in real terms over the past 30 years, boosting household purchasing power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many parts of the world, the effects of trade liberalisation have been even more profound. The World Bank estimates that, over the past quarter-century, more than one billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty, in many cases by seizing the opportunities that trade has created. The largest gains have been in Asia, including our key trading partners, such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other experts have attempted to investigate the likely economic impacts in the event an Australian government chose to wind back decades of tariff cuts and even to renegotiate existing free trade agreements. The aforementioned report by the Centre for International Economics, commissioned by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, did some valuable work on this topic. It found the short-term impact of tariff increases would cause job losses in Australia, and over the long term real wages for Australian workers would be lower, in turn cutting household consumption and Australian living standards. The modelling in the report showed that, if tariffs on manufacturing imports were raised, causing a 10 per cent price increase across the world, real GDP in Australia would be 1.8 per cent lower, and global real GDP would be 3.5 per cent lower. If tariffs on all merchandise imports were increased to raise all import prices by 10 per cent, real GDP in Australia would be 2.2 per cent lower and global real GDP would be 4.1 per cent lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key point of difference between Labor and the government on these three agreements relates to the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. These agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru all contain ISDS clauses which Labor does not support. Again, I recognise the excellent work of civil society and the trade union movement in campaigning against antiquated ISDS provisions. Importantly, however, the ISDS provisions in these agreements include newer safeguards that protect Australia from legal action against public interest laws, such as public health measures or environment law. For example, under these new ISDS clauses, tobacco giant Philip Morris would be unable to take legal action against the Australian government for its plain cigarette packaging legislation, as it unsuccessfully did several years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If these agreements do not come into force, the bilateral investment treaties that currently govern Australia's relationships with these trading partners would remain in place. In other words, Australia would be worse off. In the cases of the Hong Kong and Peru agreements, separate agreements have been made to terminate these bilateral investment treaties upon entry into force of the new trade agreements. In the case of Indonesia, no agreement was reached to terminate the old treaty. It is of course baffling why the government signed IA-CEPA without ensuring that, contrary to usual practice, the previous investment treaty with Indonesia was not terminated. It means that, for now at least, the IA-CEPA will initially coexist alongside the antiquated investment treaty and two sets of ISDS provisions will be in force. This presents a risk for Australia and it must be addressed. I'm heartened by the government's commitment today, in response to Labor's demands, that the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment will pursue an agreement with Indonesia to terminate the old bilateral investment treaty. I also note that the JSCOT committee made this recommendation in the strongest possible terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now address a number of concerns that have been raised by stakeholders in respect of these agreements. In relation to the privatisation of public services, none of the agreements include provisions that require the privatisation of any public services, and that is a good thing. However, some stakeholders remain concerned about this issue. I therefore call on the government to ensure there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government owned services, nor restrict any future decision to acquire public assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, none of the agreements include provisions that undermine our important PBS. On intellectual property, the Peru and Hong Kong agreements do not include pharmaceutical provisions, including in relation to biologics. IA-CEPA does not include a chapter on intellectual property. The investment chapters in the Peru, Hong Kong and Indonesia agreements explicitly prevent anyone from bringing an ISDS claim against the Australian government in relation to measures comprising or relating to the PBS. The PBS is a critically important part of Australia's health system. It is the envy of the world and must be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to antidumping, all three agreements preserve Australia's WTO antidumping rights. However, Labor calls on the government to rigorously enforce antidumping measures in order to ensure Australian industry is not subjected to anticompetitive and predatory trade practices. The government should consider sensible reforms, such as transferring the emergency safeguard mechanism from the Productivity Commission to the Anti-Dumping Commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports trade between Australia and the rest of the world, because trade creates jobs, generates economic growth and improves living standards. Trade has lifted millions out of poverty around the world. It provides consumers in Australia and around the world with cheaper products. Despite absurd claims to the contrary by some Liberal MPs, Labor has a long record as an advocate for an open global trading system. Labor was the party that opened up Australia to competition and helped make our exports globally competitive. In fact, it was Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley who took Australia into the world's new multilateral trading system that began after World War II. Chifley also led the foundations for close engagement with the emerging powers of Asia, boldly supporting independence for both Indonesia and India. He envisioned lucrative new export markets in our region. In the early 1970s Gough Whitlam cut tariffs by 25 per cent across the board. He also launched a new era of regional engagement when he visited China and established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. These were brave moves, unprecedented for a political leader of that time. Whitlam viewed China as a huge potential economic opportunity for Australia. Of course, almost 50 years later, China is our biggest trading partner. The reforms of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, who tore down Australia's tariff walls in the 1980s, laid the foundation for almost three decades of continuous economic growth. Hawke was the founding father of APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a vehicle for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Labor trade minister John Dawkins established the Cairns Group in order to make trade in agricultural products tariff free.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's dedication to trade reform has not dimmed in the years since. When Labor was last in government we signed trade agreements with Chile and Malaysia, along with a landmark deal with the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and New Zealand. Labor trade minister Simon Crean was also heavily involved in the Doha round in the WTO and in commencing the FTAs with China, South Korea and Japan. The Gillard government's landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian century</span> white paper identified the vast opportunities for Australia in the region. Another Labor trade minister, Craig Emerson, launched negotiations for what would become the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which we are discussing today. Unfortunately, this stalled for several years after Labor left office, and Australia's trading relationship with Indonesia has since gone backwards. The government eventually re-entered negotiations but these broke down in 2018 when, during the Wentworth by-election, the Prime Minister announced plans to relocate Australia's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This economic partnership agreement between Australia and Indonesia will help to address a relationship that is very much underdone. Indonesia has a population of 260 million people and is one of Australia's closest neighbours, yet it accounts for only around two per cent of Australia's exports. In 2018, two-way trade in goods and services was worth $17.6 billion, making Indonesia only our 14th biggest trading partner. Labor believes the IA-CEPA agreement will help to address this. Indonesia is an emerging economic giant in our region. The Indonesian economy has expanded strongly over recent decades. It remains the third-fastest growing economy in the G20, behind India and China. Based on trends, by 2030 Indonesia will move from the 16th largest economy in the world to the ninth largest, and to the fourth largest by 2050. It will have a consumer class of 135 million people by 2030. Indonesia's urban population could reach 63 per cent in 2030, up from 51 per cent in 2012. As Indonesia's economic clout grows and more of its people enter the consumer class, business opportunities in Indonesia will continue to grow. We should not overlook its challenges, of course. To realise its potential, Indonesia will need to continue the structural reform of the economy undertaken by President Joko Widodo. It will have to improve its business and investment climate, cut red tape and tackle corruption.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under IA-CEPA, Australia will eliminate all of its remaining tariffs on Indonesian goods imported. In return, Indonesia will provide duty-free or preferential access to 99.9 per cent of goods from Australia. This agreement locks in fresh trade opportunities for Australian steel manufacturers, as well as for our meat, grain, sugar, dairy and horticultural producers. The Australian steel industry and steelmakers will benefit as Indonesia reduces its existing tariff of 15 per cent on Australian steel to zero. It will also guarantee import permits for 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year. This is great news for Australian manufacturing, especially for companies like BlueScope Steel and its workers in Port Kembla. It will also ensure that BlueScope's Indonesian operations of 40-plus years, which employ more than 500 Indonesians, have access to a bigger range of high-quality, competitively-priced feedstock. It means that Australia will be well placed to contribute to the extraordinary development and infrastructure agenda of the Indonesian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the President's recent announcement that he intends to build an entirely new capital city in East Kalimantan, the possibilities are endless. Australian farmers will be able to import 500,000 tonnes of grain, wheat, barley and sorghum a year into Indonesia tariff-free, with the quota increasing five per cent a year. Indonesia is Australia's largest wheat export market, but higher grain prices in Australia caused by the drought have hit our exports. The industry has said it wants to be in a position to rapidly recover market share in Indonesia when conditions in Australia improve, and it has said that the IA-CEPA will be critical in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More generally, the outlook for Australian agricultural exports to Indonesia is very promising. Over the next three decades Indonesia's economic growth is projected to result in a quadrupling in the value of food consumption. The five per cent tariff on Australian live cattle will be eliminated, and a quota will be established for 575,000 head of cattle grown to four per cent annually over five years to 700,000 head of cattle. Northern Australia will be a great beneficiary of thisâthat is, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia will progressively eliminate tariffs on a wide range of other products, including frozen beef, sheep meat, dairy, honey, citrus fruit, vegetables, copper, plastic, automotive parts and machinery products. Australian vocational education and training providers will be able to establish ventures in Indonesia with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. Our world-leading mining service firms will for the first time be able to partner with Indonesian businesses in developing the country's extensive mineral and energy resources. Under the agreement Australian businesses will also be able to invest up to 67 per cent in Indonesian companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While much of the focus has been on Indonesia, this bill will strengthen our ties with Hong Kong and Peru. The Hong Kong agreement codifies existing trade arrangements between the two nations, providing greater certainty for Australian business. Hong Kong is Australia's leading business base in Asia and serves as a gateway for mainland China and the North Asia region. Peru is a growing market for Australian goods and services exporters, with a GDP comparable to that of Vietnam. It has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the past decade. The Peru agreement will help Australian businesses to deepen engagement with the dynamic markets of Latin America.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one final, very topical reason for these three agreements to be supported. The trade war between the US and China presents risks to Australia, which, as an export-driven economy, depends on a strong rules based trading order. We must therefore diversify our export markets lest we become a victim of the dispute between the two largest economies in the world. We must do whatever we can to encourage the survival of the multilateral trading system under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. In the meantime, Labor is moving second reading amendments. We will support the legislation before us. Most importantly, Labor will support openness. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  Let me thank the member for Brand for her comments in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill. At a time of growing global economic uncertainty and mounting trade tensions, countries like Australia need to stand up for the principle of free trade and shore up the foundations of the global trading system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade and economic growth go hand in hand. Since the end of World War II, it has been the growth in global trade that has driven increased living standards around the world. In 1945, exports were a mere five per cent of total GDP. Today, they are 25 per cent. As the IMF updated in its World Economic Outlook last week, it's the slowdown in global trade growth that is very much driving the slowdown in the global economy. Global trade growth is now down to one per cent, its lowest level in seven years, and this is leading, in the IMF's words, to a 'synchronised slowdown' in the growth of the global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries that have embraced the opportunities of global trade and opened their economies have seen the most dramatic improvement in their fortunes. China's embrace of trade and openness from the late 1970s onwards propelled China's development and lifted literally hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But the proposition that links growing trade with rising prosperity is, unfortunately, under threat from protectionist sentiments, from increasing trade tensions and from growing deadlock within the World Trade Organization.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been a huge beneficiary from the liberalisation of the global economy. The ability to trade freely around the world on the basis of transparent and predictable rules has delivered us improved living standards, better jobs, higher wages and greater choice. That is why it is important for Australia to stand up for the global trading system, to stand up for free trade and to play our part to maintain and improve the liberal and open character of the global trading system. On average, Australian businesses that export hire 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. That is why trade contributes to our economy, creates more jobs and higher-paying jobs and adds to our capacity to pay for the essential services, health and education that Australians rely on. This government's ambitious trade agenda has already resulted in more Australian businesses exportingâmore than 53,000 exporting in 2017-18, which is up 18 per cent since 2013-14âand more jobs, with one in five Australians employed in trade related employment. It's estimated that more than 240,000 trade related jobs have been created in the last five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has concluded three important free trade agreements since 2018âwith Indonesia, with Peru and with Hong Kong. The bills before the House today will amend our legislation to allow ratifications of these agreements, to allow these agreements to enter into force and for Australians to reap the benefits of these agreements. Each of these agreements will open new markets, provide greater opportunities and protections for Australian exporters and Australian investors. They will help protect the Australian economy from growing global economic headwinds by diversifying and growing our export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coverage of exports by free trade agreements in Australia has gone from 26 per cent to 70 per cent over the past six years, and these three agreements will take this further. This government's goal is to ensure that around 90 per cent of Australia's trade is covered by FTAs by 2022, including by implementing these agreements signed with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong and pursuing strong export agreements with the European Union; the Pacific Alliance, consisting of Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia; the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or the RCEP; and, when they're ready, the United Kingdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong will also strengthen relations with important partners, and each of these agreements will help buttress the global trading system and underwrite free trade at a time when it is under threat. Our agreement with Indonesia, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, has the potential to transform our economic relationship and lift it to a level that better reflects the strategic importance of our two countries to one another. Beneficiaries include Australian grain and citrus growers, cattle producers, mining-equipment providers, mining-services providers, vocational education suppliersâall these groups stand to benefit from improved market access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under IA-CEPA, once implemented, over 99 per cent of Australia's goods exports will enter Indonesia duty-free or under preferential arrangements. Key market access gains include: frozen beef and sheepmeat exports, which will have their tariff halved from five per cent to 2.5 per cent upon entering into force and eliminated entirely after five years; removing all remaining tariffs on dairy exports to support Australian dairy producers; and improving market access outcomes on services and investment, which will give Australian businesses increased certainty and confidence in the Indonesian market, including in areas such as vocational education, mining and related services, and tourism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement also lays the foundations for a comprehensive economic partnership with our largest and most significant northern neighbour. It will tackle emerging issues in trade, such as non-tariff barriers, the digital economy, connectivity, competition policy and regulatory transparency. It will improve the business and investment environment, including through modernised investor-state dispute settlement provisions. It will support Indonesia's own growth by supporting Indonesian capacity in key areas and by positioning Australia as the supplier of first choice. Indonesia is one of Australia's highest priority relationships, and this agreement with Indonesia will help grow our ties in a part of the relationship that has been historically underdone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement with Peru has concluded with one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America over the past decade, an economy comparable in size to Vietnam. It builds on the liberalisation we have already achieved in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP. Our trade with Peru has been growing in the order of 20 per cent annually, and Peru is an increasingly attractive investment destination for Australia. From 10 Australian companies investing in Peru in 2003, there are now over 90 companies in Peru, especially in the mining and mining equipment sectors. The Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement will ultimately eliminate over 99 per cent of tariffs on Australian goods to Peru, expanding on the TPP-11 agreement. It will also include the elimination of tariffs on beef cuts after five years, instant elimination of tariffs on sheepmeat and wheat, instant duty-free access on 7,000 tonnes of dairy products and immediate elimination of duties on all pharmaceutical tariffs. It will also include the recognition of Australian degrees in Peru. I would like here to thank the work of the embassy in Peru and our ambassador at the time, Mr Nicholas McCaffrey, for all he did to help conclude this agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agreement with Hong Kong, the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement, provides a comprehensive and ambitious agreement to govern the trade and investment relationship. Our economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong, one of Asia's most advanced economies, is already well established and advanced. This agreement largely codifies existing trade and market access arrangements, providing certainty for investors and exporters into the future. It modernises the treatment regime for foreign investors, making investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms more transparent and more constrained, improving safeguards for governments wishing to adopt legitimate public policy measures in areas such as tobacco control. The modern e-commerce rules governing free data flows across borders are included in the agreement as well as guaranteed access for service supplies into key sectors, including financial services, education, transport, tourism and professional services, and guaranteeing that tariffs will remain bound at zero per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good agreement on its merits with Hong Kong, but we must also be mindful of the political situation in Hong Kong, something that we in this House and the government continue to watch closely. It is certainly my view that the maintenance of the one country, two systems formulation which has governed Hong Kong since the handover in 1994, under the basic law, is important, and this agreement helps shore up the status. We've concluded this agreement with the authorities of Hong Kong, and this agreement helps re-affirm the unique status under the one country, two systems formulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Committee on Treaties found that IA-CEPA, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, and the Australia-Hong Kong FTA represent substantial gains for Australian industry, agriculture and business and, therefore, for the Australian economy. JSCOT recommended that we proceed to rapid ratification of both agreements. I thank fellow members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as well as the deputy chair, for their work in enabling our productive deliberations on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch upon some issues that the member for Brand raised in her comments regarding these agreements. The first is investor-state dispute settlement. These three agreements, with Indonesia, with Hong Kong and with Peru, strengthen our existing ISDS provisions with all three countries. The ISDS provisions in all three agreements allow the government to regulate on issues of national importance, including public health and the environment. Australia has pre-existing ISDS mechanisms in force with all three countries. Those with Peru and Hong Kong will be terminated upon entry into force of these agreements. I note that the trade minister has advised that Australia will now be pursuing termination of the Australia-Indonesia bilateral investment treaty, something the Joint Standing on Treaties recommended, and I welcome that announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no new waivers of labour market testing under these three agreements. It's important to emphasise that point: there are no new waivers of labour market testing. Nothing in these agreements changes Australia's workplace laws, nor do the agreements allow for the exploitation of working holidaymakers. All workers in Australia, whether they are Australian nationals or foreign workers, are treated equally under Australian workplace laws. This is exactly as it should be. Nothing in these agreements allows for foreign workers to work without the necessary licensing or registration or qualifications, and the government will continue to take steps to ensure that working holidaymakers are not exploited and, if required, are qualified for any work they undertake. The government has confirmed that it will not use the provisions of article 12.9 in the Indonesia agreement, or any other provisions in that agreement, to propose, create or extend any additional labour market testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service suppliers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I go to privatisation. As the member for Brand said, these agreements do not create an obligation to privatise any Australian public services, nor do they restrict any future decision to acquire public assets, and nor do they imperil schemes such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or Medicare for that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, these agreements serve Australian interests. Securing better access to export markets for Australian producers is one of our best forms of protection against global economic headwinds. These free trade agreements do just that, so I commend this enabling legislation to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the amendment and strongly urge the government, in relation to these bills before us, to consider what's being asked. It's been at least 30 years since there's been a focus in this country on some free trade agreements. Increasingly in the community, in industry and amongst workers, people are asking: but are they really worth it? We hear a lot of rhetoric about how they create jobs, but where's the economic analysis to prove that the claims made when striking an agreement, when legislation is passed through this House, have actually been achieved? That is why one of the amendments, which focuses on independent economic modelling, is so criticalâbefore, during and after. Whilst we are still waiting to learn whether the commitments made for the South Korea, Japan and China agreement have been achieved, we don't know the full impact or the cost of free trade agreements. That is where the government has a lot of work to do: to reassure people in our community that the agreements in the legislation before us will actually be good for Australian workers and Australian industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The single most important objective of trade policy should be to deliver benefits to the Australian economy and the communityâto ensure that working people have access to good jobs, secure jobs and the creation of local jobsâyet with all of the rhetoric that we hear that these agreements will do so, have they previously delivered and will they deliver in the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are questions that people are asking. In the thirty years since we've liberalised when it comes to free trade, whilst growth has been up, living standards and wages have been flatlining and, in some cases, are going backwards. Free trade agreements have been signed, yet we are losing industry and losing good, secure jobs. We are losing industry, and creating industry in areas which may not economically benefit everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the agreements we have before us, I would just highlight some of the claims that have been made and ask some questions. There has been a lot of focus on how the agreements will create jobs and secure investment for our farmers. The problem is: we're in droughtâa severe drought, a drought that's not ending. Do we have the supply to satisfy the new quotas? When it comes to grain, for example, with the grain quotas that have been achieved in all the free trade agreements, will we produce the crop this year, next year or the year after? The supply issue is not just in grain. If we look at sheepmeat, beef or any meat in our red meat sector, again the question has to be asked: what will be the impact of drought on producing the supply to satisfy these great new trade agreements? There's all this talk about how great the current and previous agreements are, but do we actually have the supply and the capacity to achieve them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we ask the question: what are we losing on the other side? Let's talk about dairy. Dairy is a really vexed question, given that we don't know if we're even going to have a viable dairy industry going forward, particularly in areas like northern Victoria. Dairy farmers are leaving in droves. This government is confused. The Australian rhetoric is confused. The economy is confused. On the one hand, we're saying that these agreements are great and are going to create industry, and then, on the other hand, we're saying that the industry is collapsing because of factors not enabling us to secure it locally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we could talk about the jobs in these industries and what they will create. They say that in the dairy industry the agreements could create up to 20 jobsâ20 jobsâin an industry which is struggling to deal with drought, with a shortage of water, and which has its own recruitment problems. Agricultural jobs tend to be a big focus, yet we hear time and time again from farmers that they can't employ Australians to do the jobs. I guess that's why we need to increase the number of backpackers coming in from Indonesiaâto do the jobs. Meat processing, which you would think would be staffed by Australians, is increasingly being staffed by working holidaymakers, backpackers and international studentsâoverseas temporary workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're being told that the agreements being put before us are good for jobs. But they're not Australian jobs. We have to then import the workers to work in these industries. This government has no plan for how to increase employment in these industries for Australians or how they're going to ensure that Australians get access to these jobs first. They've not implemented one of the recommendations that has come from the Migrant Workers Taskforce that was set up to investigate exploitation. All the agricultural industries that, they say, these agreements will benefit are the most exposed and the most at risk of worker exploitation, and people are competing against each other for temporary workers to come in from overseas and work. So when the government rants about how great these agreements are for jobs, I ask again: whose jobs? Which workers and which Australians will benefit?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's talk as to these agreements about how they are great for vocational education and training. Again, we already have significant numbers of international students coming from these countries, before these agreements have been struck. There are about 10,000 coming from Hong Kong and 9,000 from Indonesia alreadyâinternational students coming to Australia to study and to work. Also, there is a question markâyou just have to ask any academicâabout the quality of our higher education in this country and whether the education that international students are paying for is actually of good quality. That's a separate review and a separate process that's ongoing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is how they're treated as workers in this country. There are over 900,000 international students in this country that have work rights and they are an exploited underclass of worker. Report after report has exposed how they are treated in this country. They're classed by this government, by many economists and by that broad rhetoric as being a top export industry, but what they really are is an underclass of workers. A UNSW report recently found that a significant number of these workers were paid less than $12 an hour, and 43 per cent of these workers were paid less than $15 an hour, well below the minimum wage. When you start to talk about those kinds of figuresâof 900,000 workers in this country being treated that wayâyou have to ask yourself: is this a good trade industry, when really what you're doing is creating an underclass of workers in this country? That's why the amendment that Labor's put forward that talks about the exploitation of temporary workers is really trying to push the government to sort that issue out. The government is asking Australians to believe in these free trade agreements when it's done very little to ensure that workers who come here to work in these industries that will benefit from these agreements, or who come here as an industry themselves in relation to international students, are not being treated properly here in this country and are victims of exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Peru agreement talks about increased market access to sugar. It's really hard to take the government seriously when it talks about sugar market access when you talk to sugar farmers in Queensland who are still baffled about the sugar code and baffled about the future of their industry and who cite the same problems that other industries have in agriculture: 'We don't have the workforce, we don't have the water, we don't have the support that's required.' Again it talks about how great it is for wine, sheep meat, horticulture and wheat products. Will we have the supply? Will we have the supply to satisfy these agreements? We talk about how great this is for jobs and industry, yet not really having the independent economic analysis to say if we have the industry to sell under these agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the impact of the growing problem that trade agreements are starting to focus on, like the social aspects and the movement of people when it comes to these trade agreementsâthe movement of natural persons. We need to start to question: is it really the role of free trade agreements to be looking at the trading and movement of people? There are some concerns that have been raised in relation to who comes in under what visas. I'm not going to take the government at its word when it says that there will be no weakening of labour market testing when it comes to these agreements. The report that was put forward by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties said that Australia will waive labour market testing for business visitors, intracorporate transfers and independent executives. My question is: does this include the 400 visa? What safeguards are in place to ensure there is not manipulation of these visas to ensure it doesn't become a back door for big numbers of people to come in? The 400 visa, as some may or may not know, is the visa on which lots of trade assistants have come in to build the solar industry, because apparently we don't have the skills to build solar farms in this country. It has become a bit of a manipulation of this visa, and we are seeing very little effort by the government to close those loopholes down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to these agreements, our community is concerned. They express their concerns daily. It's the secrecy in which these agreements have been struck that people are raising their concerns about. There have been concerns raised by nurses about the potential for foreign labour workers to come in under contractual services. We need to take this seriously and rule out that these agreements will be used to see more temporary workers come in and work as PSAs, work as nurses, or work in industries where the real issue and barrier is our lack of dealing with skills and lack of dealing with pay. We need to look at what contractual service could mean when it comes to other industries like housekeeping and hospitality. We've seen report after report exposing how temporary workers who come into this country in these industries are quite often exploited and underpaid. The government needs to rule out that this will occur. This creates, again, further tension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also needs to take on board the request for independent economic modelling. We hear a lot of ranting and rhetoric about what's good about free trade agreements, but what are we losing? If you take what happened recently in the manufacturing sector, are we going to ensure that our industries are protected going forward and that we do have growth in industries? What's this government doing about the non-tariff barriers? If you talk to manufacturers, if you talk to businesses, if you talk to industry, if you talk to workers, they go, 'The agreement's there, but it's the non-tariff barriers that are really preventing us from being able to grow our industry.' It's the biggest complaint that you get about the China free trade agreement. When you talk to winemakers, they go, 'It doesn't mean anything for me because I can't actually get my wine off the port.' There's more and more red tape, yet, despite the calls from industry, despite the calls from businesses, there's been very little effort by this government to tackle the non-tariff barriersâthe red tape, as it's been called.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a failure by this government to really implement any decent legislation when it comes to stopping dumping. Dumping is costing us jobs in this country. There's also a real failure by this government to address, as I've said, the concerns about worker exploitation under temporary work visa arrangements. All of this feeds into the challenges about why the government is putting all its eggs into this free trade agreement basket and calling them the great nirvana, when really it's failing to address the broader concerns and anxieties that Australian workers have. These anxieties are real and something that I hope the government takes on board when considering this. It is not enough just to pass free trade agreements and enter into them. It's what happens every day after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's track record on free trade agreements is a lot of talk and a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of delivery. That is why independent economic analysis is so critical. Are they creating the jobs that have been promised? Are they growing the industries that have been promised? Are they actually ensuring that workers who come here in good faith are not being exploited and mistreated? These concerns that are being raised by workers' unions and civil society need to be addressed, they need to be considered if we are to have confidence in free trade going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always stood in this place and said that we support fair trade, yet 'fair' is increasingly becoming a dirty word in the debate about trade. You can support trade and still believe in fair trade; it isn't one or the other. But, unfortunately, with this government, free trade agreements are the only positive economic narrative they have. Yet Australians are sceptical, and they have a right to be sceptical not just because of the points I've outlined but because of the points many others have outlined. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  On balance, Labor has decided to support the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill not because the agreements are perfect but because the agreements are positive on the basis of jobs for Australians and the Australian economy. The fact is that one in five Australians depend upon trade for their work. The fact is that Indonesia isn't even in our top 10 trading nations. We can and we should do better. These agreements, particularly after the safeguards that Labor demanded from the government as a condition of our support have been agreed to in writing by the minister for trade, Simon Birmingham, mean that the overall assessment of the jobs that will be created has to be positive. Therefore, as I've said before, Labor will not oppose these bills just for oppositions sake. Where the government is prepared to engage and be constructive, we will participate in those processes. That is what the people who sent us to this parliament expect of us. The fact is that we consulted very widely to identify practical, commonsense measures that will ensure that their implementation achieves the goals of creating Australian jobs and opening up opportunities for our exporters, measures that will safeguard Australian jobs and working conditions, measures that will expand opportunities for Australian exporters, including those in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always fight for what's good for the Australian economy, for what's good for jobs and for what's good for Australian workers. Last week, we demanded and have now received these undertakings that we sought from the government. I confirm that we have been successful and the government has guaranteed in writing that, first, Australian jobs will be protected. There will be no new labour market testing waivers, and these agreements will not change Australia's workplace laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the government has agreed that it will not use provisions of article 12.9, or any other provision of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, to propose, create or extend any additional labour market testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service suppliers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, it will, for the first time, bring forward legislation to introduce criminal penalties for the worst forms of worker exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, new measures will be introduced to ensure that working holidaymakers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work that they undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthâand I think this is a critical pointâit will seek the termination of the existing 1993 bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia, which includes out-of-date investor protection provisions and does not contain appropriate public interest safeguards. When we were having discussions with interested parties about the nature of these agreements, there was no-one who said that what is in the agreements that are being proposed here is a backward step from the agreements that currently are in place over trade between Australia and Indonesia. This is a step forward. Therefore, the removal of the existing bilateral agreement, which doesn't have the safeguards that we will have going forward, is an important step. To me, that alone signals that when people are saying an agreement is an improvement then it's one that, pragmatically, we should support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, the existing investor-state dispute settlement and other agreements will be updated, where possible, to include modern, stronger safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventh, we'll review the ISDS mechanism in the new agreement as part of the five-year review of that agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighthâand this is important, as well, because this was of concern in the submission from the Nurses and Midwives Association to the JSCOT inquiryâthe agreements do not force the privatisation of any government services and, what's more, they don't provide any restriction whatsoever on any future decision to acquire public assets. So you'd have more public ownership, not less. But it's not impacted at all by these agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninth, on the Hong Kong agreement we sought confirmation that we would continue to monitor the situation there, given the internal issues that are taking place, to make sure that Australia's strong support for the one country, two systems principle is maintained. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will conduct an inquiry into all aspects of Australia's treaty-making process, with the aim of improving transparency and consultation. That is an important thing going forward, because we are certainly of the view that whilst this legislation is connected up with the treaties that are proposed, it's not actually legislation about the treaties. That goes through a cabinet process. It's one on which there is no parliamentary vote. Given that it is in the province of the executive rather than the parliament, it's important that there be far greater transparency in these processes up-front so that people can be satisfied that, on balance, any of these agreements are in the interests of Australian jobs. We don't give a blank cheque on these. They should be analysed on the basis of: are they in our national interest to do so?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> In particular, Labor has a very strong view that the agreements need to demonstrate that nothing in any agreement will undermine Australian working conditions. Nothing in any agreement should ever lead to exploitation of foreign workers, if they participate. Our strong view about labour market testing is that, as our first preference, we want Australians to do jobs which Australians are qualified to do. We make no apology for putting the interests of Australian workers first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subject to proper protections we will support arrangements that lead to the creation of new jobs, because Labor is the party of jobs. With these agreements reducing barriers to trade, I'm convinced that they will be positive overall. Labor, indeed, initiated negotiations for the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement; we did that in 2013, after we commissioned a joint feasibility study with Indonesia earlier on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at Indonesia, it is the world's third-largest democracy. It is our closest neighbour. It has the largest Islamic population in the world. You've always got to examine the counterfactual as well, and the counterfactual is this: particularly since Paul Keating's leadership, Labor has recognised the importance of the relationship with our near-neighbour to the north and the importance of friendship between our two peoples. If they were to say, 'We have this agreement that won't undermine workers' rights, that won't lead to foreign workers replacing Australian workers, that won't put any pressure on any other issues that have been raised on privatisation or anything else'âif this parliament were to reject that agreement, then I think if you were in Indonesia, in Jakarta, you'd be entitled to think, 'Why is it that Australians want to fly over us to China, to Japan, to Korea, to other countries where we have agreements in place, and ignore Indonesia?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia will grow to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. It is a democracy. It is one that is growing at more than five per cent. Based on current trends, by 2030 it will have around 135 million people who are consumers. But the economic relationship between Australia and Indonesia currently has the lowest bilateral trade volumes of any pairing in the G20. I find that quite remarkable. The fact is: in 2018 Indonesia accounted for just two per cent of Australia's exports, and there has been no increase in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement will facilitate Australian suppliers of technical and vocational education and training to provide services, for example, through majority Australian owned businesses in Indonesia. They'll be able to establish ventures with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. Australian universities currently have more than 118 formal agreements with Indonesian universities. They'll be allowed to open up campuses in Indonesia. If Australia was to receive the same proportion of students from Indonesia as it receives from Malaysia, this would add around 150,000 additional studentsâwhich would equate to approximately $11 billion in additional exports for the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement also eliminates and reduces tariffs. This figure, I think, is pretty significant: in return for two per cent of Indonesian exports getting tariff-free access to Australia, 25 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesia will not face any tariffs. That includes steelâsomething that is of particular importance to the Illawarra and other regions around Australia. The agreement provides for guaranteed import permits of 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year. If you want to visualise that, that is the equivalent of five Sydney Harbour Bridges. BlueScope, in particular, is set to benefit from this arrangement, opening up the potential for more competitive exports to Indonesiaâwhich translates simply as jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, grain will benefit from this agreement. The whole of northern Australia has particular potential to benefit from this agreement as well. It will open up new opportunities for Australian manufacturers of medical devices, cosmetics and skin products and other high-value manufacturing that takes place here. That means jobs for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indonesia, on the day that I and our shadow foreign minister met with the foreign minister of Indonesia, President Widodo announced a new capital cityâa bit like Canberraâwhere there is currently nothing at all. Do you know what that means? It means a demand for engineers, demand for steel, demand for architects and demand for legal and service providersâdemand which can be met by Australian infrastructure companies. This is an enormous benefit for the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Hong Kong is an important destination as well. It's our fifth-largest source of inwards investment. Given the nature of Hong Kong and given that we have an agreement with China, it's important that we also have an agreement with Hong Kong, which is an entry point into China and into North Asia as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst these are not agreements that we would have negotiatedâwe would have had up-front a very different attitude towards labour market testing and a range of measures, as we have very publicly saidâwe have assurances from the government and we do think that, on balance, this is in the interests of Australian jobs and Australian businesses, which is why we will be supporting these agreements. The government entered into discussions in good faith and put responses in writing, and I confirm that it is on the basis of these commitments that Labor will be supporting this legislation. I seek leave to table the letter giving commitments from the minister for trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Brand. This legislation is the enabling legislation for the Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru free trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a trading nation. Forty-two per cent of Australia's nominal GDP is based upon trade. Since the Whitlam government it has been the bipartisan policy of governments, since the early seventies, to pursue tradeâand for good reason. We are unlikely to be able to maintain the level of prosperity that we have in our country today, as well as the level of employment, if we are solely based on engaging in that with our domestic economy of 25 million people. To maintain high-quality jobs and the prosperity and the standard of living that we enjoy today, Australia needs to be a part of the global trading system; we need access to markets around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at Australia's trading landscape, one of the countries which stands out in a glaring wayâthat our trading relationship is underdone withâis Indonesia. Currently, our two-way trade with Indonesia is $16.8 billion. That compares with Singapore, where our two-way trading relationship is $27.8 billion, and Malaysia at $21.5 billion. But the difference is this: in Singapore, the population is six million people and in Malaysia it's 32 million. In Indonesia, the population is 270 million people. It is anticipated that by the middle of this century, as a result of that enormous population and that enormous potential market, Indonesia will become the fourth-largest economy in the world. So if we seek to have trade continue to play the role in our domestic economy that it does today and to use it to build high-quality jobs in this country going forward, then we must be in a trading relationship with Indonesia on a bigger scale than is currently the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Indonesian agreement, and indeed the Hong Kong agreement, also forms part of Australia's engagement with Asia. This is a story which has been written by Labor governments going right back to the Chifley government. In the aftermath of the Second World War and Australia's focus on the Pacific theatre of that war, it was the Chifley government which understood that out of the ashes of the Second World War in the East Asian time zone would grow an economic powerhouse. But, just as significantly, it was understood that it was absolutely essential that Australia find its security in Asia. This was a sentiment that was reflected in a very famous quote that was made half a century later by another Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ Australia needs to seek its security in Asia rather than from Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was of course the Whitlam government which established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and all that that has implied since in terms of our economic relationship with that country. It was the Rudd-Gillard government which gave us the Asian century white paper, published in October 2012, which spoke about the enormous opportunity that the rising middle class in Asia represented for our economy, as well as the strategic significance of East Asia to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if we look at Indonesia specifically, again, it was the Chifley government which placed Australia at the forefront of supporting Indonesia's independence movement. It was Paul Keating who, in December 1995, establish the signature Australia-Indonesia Security Agreement, and it was the Rudd government which invited President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to this place to address the Australian parliament in March 2010. In doing so, he was the first Indonesian president to address the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that occasion President Yudhoyono referred to the history of our relationship with Indonesia. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are not just neighbours, we are not just friends; we are strategic partners. We are equal stakeholders in a common future with much to gain if we get this relationship right and much to lose if we get it wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦Â Â Â â¦Â Â Â â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We in Indonesia will always remember that Australia resolutely stood by us when Indonesia was struggling for our God-given right to independence and statehood. We remember how Prime Minister Chifley, foreign minister Evatt and diplomat Sir Richard Kirby actively supported Indonesia during critical moments of diplomacy in the United Nationsâa standard collegiate with that of the Netherlands. That was one of the finest hours of our relationship, and we have had many more high points since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those comments spoke about how important our relationship is with Indonesia going forward. In that context, it is worth noting that the Indonesian free trade agreement, which will be enabled by the legislation that we are debating today, will be the first free trade agreement that Indonesia enters into with any other nation in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free trade agreements shape economies, and, whilst it is important that we are doing this agreement, it's important that the agreement is a good deal. But I would submit that this is a good deal. This will provide a reduction in tariffs for two per cent of Indonesian exports to Australia and an increase of 4,000 places in Australia's working holiday visa scheme. It's worth noting that that is in a context of 210,000 people being in Australia today under working holiday arrangements and in a context where the existing cap of 1,000 working holiday places provided to those from Indonesia is not fully subscribed at this moment, so the increase in the number of working holiday visas in Australia as a result of this agreement will be, by any measure, marginal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on the Australian side, what the agreement will provide is a reduction in tariffs in respect of 25 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesiaâin some cases, a reduction in tariffs from 30 per cent down to zero. In the case of Australian exports of steel we will see the reduction down to zero of a 15 per cent tariff on steel exports to Indonesia. In areas such as mining services and agriculture, commodities such as grains, sugar and cattle, and in the provision of services around education and health care, the Indonesian free trade agreement will provide much better access for Australian exports to Indonesia and, in the process, build our economic relationship with Indonesia and, in the process of that, create jobs and build prosperity in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement is not exactly the agreement that Labor would have made had we been in office. We have sought a number of improvements to it, which are contained in the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Brand and that Labor supportsâimprovements which would see the labour market testing that currently applies in Australia's temporary work arrangements apply to any future providers of contractual services to Australia from Indonesia, making sure that working holidaymakers, when they come to this country, are not exploited; making sure that there is the termination of the 1993 bilateral investment treaty which has contained in it an old investor-state dispute settlement clause, which is very wide, and replacing it with the clause which is currently in this agreement, which is more modern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making that observation I'd also make the observation that Labor has a longstanding opposition to investor-state dispute settlement clauses in trade agreements but, given there is this clause in the agreement which is before us today, we have been seeking a commitment from the government that there be a review of that clause after five years. We've also been seeking an agreement that the Joint Standing Committee on Trade engage in an inquiry on the entire treaty-making process in our nation so that it is more transparent not only to the public but also to this parliament. We want to make sure that there is absolutely no inference whatsoever within the Indonesian free trade agreement that there would be any privatisation of Australian government services, we want to make sure that there is an enforcing of the existing anti-dumping measures within Australia and we also want to make sure that there is an adoption of independent economic modelling and analysis of future free trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what's contained in the second reading amendment, but it was also contained in a letter from the member for Brand, Labor's shadow minister for trade, to the minister for trade on 17 October, along with a request that, in respect of the Hong Kong free trade agreement, nothing removed Australia's support for the principle of one country, two systems in terms of Hong Kong's relationship and being part of the People's Republic of China. There is a response to this letter by the minister for trade on 21 October, which agreed to just about every one of the improvements that were sought in the letter from the member for Brand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that, it has to be said that this represents a very significant win on behalf of all those, including those within the trade union movement, who have been campaigning for the very best trade agreements that we can have and that Australia can enter into. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is on the basis of the commitments that have been provided by the minister for trade that Labor is now able to support this legislation today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of concerns that have been legitimately raised by many people within our community, including the trade union movement, particularly around the exploitation of those in Australia under temporary work visa arrangements. This is a real issue. There is exploitation of people on temporary work arrangements in this country today, and it is a stain on our country that that exploitation occurs. But, in saying that, this has not principally evolved as a result of Australia entering free trade agreementsâalthough it is natural, given clauses that have existed in free trade agreements, that people are anxious about the interaction of free trade agreements with the question of temporary workers in this country. It is an issue which needs dealing with, but it is not principally a function of trade agreements. Indeed, the investment facilitation agreement of the China free trade agreement, which was the subject of much debate in this place, has seen no investor facilitation agreements registered in accordance with ChAFTA since it has come into this place and, accordingly, no temporary workers come into this country as a result of that agreement. As I mentioned earlier, the impact that the Indonesian free trade agreement will have on the number of persons coming to this country on working holiday visas will be marginal. That said, the issue, more generally, is one which needs to be dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, by virtue of repealing the 1993 investment agreement with Indonesia, a situation now where the investor-state dispute settlement provision within the Indonesian free trade agreement will be much better. There is no provision in this agreement which will see any inference at all in relation to the privatisation of any government services. It is worth noting that Indonesia is a signatory to the eight core ILO conventions. There is nothing in this agreement that will waive labour market testing, nothing that will undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, nothing that will undermine our antidumping provisions, nothing that will undermine the government regulation of public welfare or the safety of products and nothing that will undermine existing government procurement policies. There is no exemption of any person from Australian law, and there is nothing which undermines Australia's skills certification regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our place in Asia is absolutely central to our future. Our place as a trading nation is absolutely essential to continued jobs growth and prosperity in this country. For those two reasonsâsupporting this legislation, which enables the Indonesian free trade agreement, the Hong Kong free trade agreement and the Peru free trade agreement, along with the second reading amendment, which has been moved by the member for Brandâit is absolutely essential to make sure that we continue to trade, that we continue to see jobs growth and that we continue to engage with our region.</span>

This legislation before us today seeks to reduce barriers to trade through creating more competitive industries and further benefit customers through lower prices and greater choices. Overall, deeper regional integrations through the agreements implemented through this legislation will generate added trade and output gains in Australia's sectors of comparative advantage, in particular agriculture, mining and education. This will mean more jobs and training opportunities for Aussies in or wanting to get into these same industries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are an export nation. Businesses in Australia that export on average hire 23 per cent more staff and pay 11 per cent higher wages. Trade is good for jobs and growth in our nation at a time where economic growth is the slowest since the global financial crisis, wages are stagnant, almost two million Aussies are looking for more work and living standards are going backwards. These trade agreements are a positive step to getting our economy back on track, and, frankly, under this government, they are about the only thing that is heading that way now. Labor support trade and we will support these agreements. As we encounter an increasingly unstable international trading system and possible limits to the power of the World Trade Organization in resolving trade disputes, Australia must engage in bilateral agreements to support our interests. It's in our nation's best interests to diversify the access we have to markets around the world lest our current trading partners make decisions that may affect our ability to trade freely.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Last week was Anti-Poverty Week. I want to take this opportunity to tell the House about a wonderful local antipoverty event in the Shoalhaven. Prosperity in the Park is held every year at Parramatta Park in East Nowra. Even the rain could not keep people away from this year's event. A huge banner at the festival read: 'From poverty to prosperityâit's our future, let's do it right'. That pretty much sums it up. Community organisations, too many to name hereâincluding Shoalcoast Community Legal Centre, Disability Services Australia, the Rural Adversity Mental Health Program, Unions Shoalhaven and Shoalhaven Neighbourhood Servicesâcame together to let the community know how they could help. Government services like Service NSW, Roads and Maritime Services, and the local police were also there to lend a hand. We were entertained by the Basin Bowlers in their Hawaiian shirts, and there were fun games and a jumping castle for the kids. There were even hand massages and a free community barbecue, with a sausage sizzle, bacon and egg rolls as well as fruit salad and cereal. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my favourite things about the beautiful South Coast of New South Wales is our ability to come together in the name of a good cause, and what better cause can there be than ending poverty? Well done to the Shoalhaven Anti-Poverty Committee and Shoalhaven City Council for organising this event. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Dave Carroll works at the Northern Co-operative Meat Company in Casino and recently went into cardiac arrest whilst at work. I'd like to recognise and thank Darren Grimston, Darrell Schultz, Jason Keep, Luke Murphy and Steve Formaggian, who stepped up, put their training to use and saved Dave's life. The beat of 'Staying Alive' is how the men were taught to remember the timing of compressions to the chest to resuscitate the heart. Dave fell to the floor of the boning room with his sharpening knives. His heart stopped eight times. Luke rushed in and started CPR and sent Darrell to get the defibrillator. Darren had to run and get an oxygen tank from the first aid room. They'd only completed their safety training six weeks earlier and had only used a defibrillator on dummies. The men had to shock Dave's heart four times. For 30 minutes they kept reviving as his heart stopped and started. An ambulance arrived, and he later had surgery. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I rise to discuss the Westbury prison, which has been foist upon the people of Westbury by the Tasmanian state Liberal government. The people of Westbury, a beautiful little town in the north-west of my electorate, woke up a couple of weeks ago to find that the state government had decided to put a new maximum security prison two kilometres from their doorstep, with no consultation. It's just two kilometres out of town and it came as a complete surprise to the people of Westbury. There was no consultation; it was just lobbed on their doorstep. The pamphlets are ready to goâglossy pamphlets talking about this prisonâso this is a fait accompli. No consultation: 'You're getting a prison outside Westbury. Like it or lump it.' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently there were 11 sites up for consideration, and the state government has refused to say what the benefits or cons or pros were of any of the other sites. The first order of business should be transparency. Why didn't they choose any of these other sites? What's so compelling about Westbury that it has to go where people don't want it? There has been a complete lack of respect shown to the people of Westbury. They've been treated like mushrooms in their own backyards. They absolutely deserve better. There's a community rally this Saturday, 26 October, at 11.30 in the Village Green, where people can have their say. This is David versus Goliath, and David deserves to win. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The Children's Bookshop in Beecroft is soon to close its doors, after almost 50 years of serving the Berowra community. It's the oldest specialist children's bookshop in New South Wales. The third owner, Paul MacDonald, is the current owner, having taken over from Hellene and Nick Boon, who bought the bookshop from its founder, Dr Robin Morrow, who still comes in every single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robin Morrow and her mother, Beryl Matthews, established The Children's Bookshop in 1971, when Robin's own children were very young. A local book-lover, Rosalind Benson, designed the logo. From the earliest days, the store has been far more than simply a place that sells books. It has been an iconic part of the children's literature landscape in Australia, providing training to teachers and librarians; and holding story-times, workshops and around 50 book launches every year. When Jill McGilvray was the store's manager, 'book breakfasts' at a local cafe gave children a chance to meet authors and illustrators. Countless children have discovered a love of reading through the store.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Undoubtedly, the challenges that affect retail have hit it hard. The business will continue supplying books to schools, but the store will close. The response from the community, though, has been overwhelming. One local student wrote a card, saying, 'Dear Paul, I'm really sorry you're leaving Beecroft. Every day, I have brekkie at Long Shot and I always come to the bookshop. Love, Roxy Kerr.' Another child offered $240, everything she had in her savings, to keep the bookshop open.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Children's Bookshop has made an incredible contribution to our community. It's hard to imagine Beecroft without it. Thank you to all of those who have given so much through the store over the years, and I wish Paul and his family good luck.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  In a 21st-century globally connected world, a free press is a national security imperative. The internet has brought the world onto our handsets and into our living rooms, but it has also brought a far greater risk of foreign interference and foreign influence operations into our democracy. We are not alone here. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has found that 20 nations have experienced cyber-enabled foreign interference in electoral or democratic institutions since 2016. Our best defence against this foreign interference is healthy, vibrant, democratic institutions, including a free press. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our journos are the ones who bring covert, corrupt or coercive foreign influences to light. Excessive constraints on the freedom of the press, through the chilling use of secrecy laws to raid journalists, the misuse of freedom of information laws, stifling laws of defamation, chronic underfunding of the ABC or interference with its independence, do little to protect our democracy. Rhetorical attacks on fake news or the contemptuous dismissal of journalists' questions as rumour or 'Canberra bubble' issues by our politicians don't do any service to our democracy either. The government haven't gone as far yet as Sir Robert Menzies did, when he actually jailed a journalist, but it's about time the Prime Minister stopped treating the freedom of the press as little more than an inconvenience and started treating it as an essential pillar of both our national security and our democracy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I rise today to recognise a tremendous young person in my electorate, Lucy Lonnqvist, this year's winner of the My First Speech competition. Lucy presented her winning speech in Parliament House last week and spoke passionately about using wellbeing, not just the GDP, to measure a country's success. Lucy argued that economic growth matters, but it is not the most important indicator of a country's collective wellbeing. We should also consider what really matters to us in our lives, what we value in the communities in which we live and what kind of society we want to be. It was inspiring to meet Lucy, a student of St Mary's Anglican Girls School and resident of Curtin, and listen to her determination, her passion and her will to make positive change in society. Lucy is already making a difference, and I have no doubt that she will continue to do so in the years to come. I'm sure that this will also not be the last time that she comes to this place. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we provide opportunities for our young people to step up, pursue their passions and make a positive contribution to the communities in which they live, and this competition does just that. Thank you to the judges, particularly to the Speaker of the House, for organising the competition, and congratulations again to Lucy and to all the other prize winners.</span>

Guru Nanak Dev Ji was the founder of Sikhism and the first of the 10 Sikh gurus, and on the weekend I attended a celebration in my electorate of Guru Nanak's 550th birthday, which was a great honour. What a wonderful philosopher, revolutionary and activist Guru Nanak was for the world, well ahead of his time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of his birth, South-East Asian society was riddled with social problemsâfeudal economic relations, a religious based caste system. Yet Guru Nanak offered dignity to the people in the lower hierarchy of society by emphasising that everyone was equalâman or woman, rich or poorâand by rejecting religious hatred and showing that actions were much more important than dogma or labels. Guru Nanak's timeless teachings remain a source of inspiration for millions today, and the global Sikh community bring his teachings into their own lives as social activists, serving humanity and treating all people equally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Sikh Volunteers Australia, who continue Guru Nanak's practice of langar, the community kitchen where everyone is equal, which provides free vegetarian food funded by a sharing of their own monthly earnings. Through his emphasis on the belief that a good life is lived within and as part of the community, Guru Nanak brought equality, good actions, honesty and hard work to the core of the value system of his followersâa value system which we would be wise to cherish today here in modern Australia, especially at a time when inequality is rising.</span>

Have a look at Tamworth: Tuesday, sunny; Wednesday, sunny; Thursday, sunny; Friday, sunny; Saturday, blowing; Sunday, sunny; Monday, sunny; Tuesday, sunny; Wednesday, partly cloudy. That is the issue that's pressing on people's mind. I want people out there to know that the National Party is hard at work. We continue to work towards the development of further policy that works on the back of the changes to the farm household allowance; the concessional loans scheme; farm management deposits, which are being used at the moment; and water infrastructure, which we're rolling out. On top of the Rookwood Weir and places such as Emu Swamp, we now have the Dungowan dam. There is half-a-billion dollars in that alone. We're also working towards the Mole River dam.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that there's more that we can do, and we'll be putting our shoulders to the wheel to do precisely that. We know that if we work closely with our communities, with the special knowledge and skill set that they have, we can deliver further programs to make sure that the certain requirements that are particular and, in many instances, different can be dealt with. The National Party has had at its forefront looking after people of regional areas. They did it under John Anderson, with the exceptional circumstances program. The National Party did it through the agriculture white paper, and it continues to do it now. I want to remind the Australian people that the National Party remains hard at work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Colleagues, today I welcome to parliament the future captains, vice-captains and student leaders of FCJ College Benalla and Sacred Heart College Yarrawonga. I'm pleased that they've joined us here in the chamber. These inspiring year 11 students travelled to Canberra as part of their preparation for leadership next year. This trip has given them the opportunity to learn firsthand how our government works and, more importantly, learn from each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over lunch today we discussed issues they feel most strongly about, ranging from climate change to lowering the voting age to 16âwhich they were very much in favour ofâfamily violence, honesty in political campaigning and the impact of drought on educational opportunities for young people in rural communities. I'm acutely aware that young people often feel neglected or ignored by politics, that it has nothing to offer them. I want them to know that we see you and we hear you, and we need young people like you in our parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Indi, I will advocate for better employment and tertiary education options, accessible mental health support and real action on climate change. I know our rural and regional communities can offer a bright future to you and I'm looking forward to our next generation of leaders such as you. With study and exams, year 12 is difficult enough, even before the extra responsibility of a leadership role. I applaud these young people for putting themselves forward to serve as a voice for students, and I wish them all the very best for the year ahead. I am very proud to be their member for Indi.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  With International Credit Union Day last Friday, I ask the House today to note the ongoing unlevel playing field with the four major banks and the non-major banks, credit unions and mutuals, who also compete in that space. Since the GFC, regulatory settings that we are familiar with have left us with the four major banks holding 80 per cent of the market and another 90 authorised deposit institutions fighting over the remainder. While this may be as good as it gets, it doesn't represent true competition. As we saw in <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> last week, despite having higher funding costs and having to hold more capital against each loan than the big four, non-major banks continue to offer lower rates in many cases. This is simply not sustainable in the long run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The desire of these nonmajors to compete does need to be fully unleashed so that we actually have a better banking sector and, ultimately, better outcomes for Australian families. For the sake of mum-and-dad mortgage holders, for instance, small business even, I call upon APRA to take action around capital and funding settings. That will work to level the competitive playing field in the banking sector. On International Credit Union Day last week, the theme was 'Local Service. Global Reach'. Remember these credit unions and mutuals have been around for over 100 years and they, ultimately, are customer owned. We wish the big four well but the smaller ones should be there side by side as well, making sure Australia continues to have one of the highest quality banking sectors.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I'd like to congratulate The Bower Repair and Reuse Centre for yet another wonderful ParraPickers second-hand market on Friday night. I spent a couple of hours there. It is wonderful to see so many people who are concerned about our environment making sure that our used goods don't end up in landfill. I want to talk today also about The Bower Repair and Reuse Centre's latest campaign, which is a right-to-repair campaign. We have all found times when we have thrown something out because it was too costly to repair it or could not get it repaired and it has gone into landfill when it probably had years of life left. The right-to-repair campaign asks that manufacturers produce goods that are fixable, ensuring manuals and spare parts are easily available and allowing everyday Australians to make reasonable attempts to repair items without risk of voiding the warranty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A right to repair would also encourage manufacturers to make high-quality, long-lasting goods in the first place rather than products that conveniently die as soon as the warranty expires. The Bower has launched a petition calling on government to act as we move towards a circular economy. I have to say I don't agree with all of the suggestions they put forward as to how we might do that but this is a debate we have to have and it is really important voices like this one be heard, so let me help amplify it today. They are looking at making sure that Australians have access to products that last longer than the warranty, that we produce goods that are fixable. If you are out there in the land of social media, join the movement, click on the link and sign the petition.</span>

Building this train station is a priority for the people of northern Mandurah. Many locals have waited over 10 years for this train station to be built. I am proud of the Morrison government's record. We are the only government to have ever committed funding towards the construction of Lakelands, with $37 million on the table. By contrast, the WA Labor government is hopelessly conflicted on this issue. There are some, such as WA Minister Paul Papalia, who have argued that no-one needs Lakelands train station. Minister Papalia's argument was knocked on the head on election night. The people of north Mandurah abandoned Labor and voted for the only party with a plan to build the station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of Labor, there is the member for Mandurah, Minister David Templeman, who says the WA government does support Lakelands but he has failed to deliver any funding thus far. This failure comes despite David Templeman sitting at the WA cabinet table. WA Labor has a problem. Will they finally build the train station north of Mandurah that the people of Lakelands need? The people have made their views very clearly known this weekend with the election of Ahmed Zilani to the north ward of Mandurah. Ahmed has been an outspoken and at times colourful campaigner for the stationâI note his hunger strike in support of the train station. Will WA finally listen? I call on David Templeman to take action to help make the Lakelands train station happen. If he doesn't, Labor will own that failure at the next election.</span>

This is certainly the case for a proposal by Cleanaway to build an energy-from-waste incinerator at Eastern Creek. A similar facility was proposed by Dial A Dump at Eastern Creek just last year, which saw more than 1,000 objections lodged with the New South Wales Independent Planning Commission and, similarly, a New South Wales upper house inquiry into that proposed energy-from-waste facility received nearly 1,000 public submissions against the project and only two in favour. Nothing has changed. It is just a different company now and they are proposing the same old thing: using Western Sydney as a dumping ground. The potential health impacts of such a proposal have not been adequately identified or addressed. It is a huge facility that's proposed to be located within a kilometre of homes, schools and sporting facilities. According to figures obtained by Seven News, 150 trucks will be used every single day to deliver waste to this facility. It will place increasing pressure on the already resource-starved infrastructure of Western Sydney. It is a facility that is not the solution to the waste challenges we face as a country. We are not Sydney's dumping ground and we certainly should not see this facility proceed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Last Friday, I was delighted to attend Headland machinery's 70th anniversary in my electorate of Chisholm. I was thoroughly impressed with Headland's story of success in Australia. Businesses like Headland are vital to Australia's continued economic success, and it's great to celebrate their achievements. During the evening, I was given a full tour of Headland's facilities by their managing director, Annaliese Kloe. Annaliese stated that Headland is doing extremely well and one of their associated businesses is planning to double their workforce over the coming year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has promised to create 1.25 million jobs over the next five years, and this is how we are going to do it: hand in hand with businesses in our communities. This is an incredible real-life example of what is happening under the coalition government's plan for a stronger economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  The Liberal Party are again trying to increase the goods and services taxâthe 'never ever' tax that the Liberal Party imposed on the Australian people some 20 years ago. Today in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> we read that the New South Wales Liberal government is looking to broaden the GST. It's always under the guise of reform, but they let the truth slip. The Liberal Party plan to broaden the GST is to help cut stamp duty for property investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadening the GST is a tax on education. Broadening the GST is a tax on milk, bread, fresh fruit and vegetables. Broadening the GST means you put a tax on baby food and baby formula. Broadening the GST is a tax on Australian farmersâa farmer tax at the worst possible time for this country. It will send the cost of fresh food and vegetables up by two, three, four or five per cent at once. We cannot afford the Liberal Party's plan to increase the GST.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party's plan; it's the Prime Minister's own plan. Back in February 2016âremember?âhe opened the discussion for the GST increase, saying it was how he wanted to fund income tax cuts. That's rightâhe was going to impose a tax to give a tax cut! If you have a tax you get a tax, under the Prime Minister. And Treasurer Frydenberg said that there 'could be benefits that will come from the GST increase'. The Liberal Party needs to give up on their plans to increase the GST.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Last week, Tom Fleming, a student of Rosebank College in Five Dock, joined my electoral office for his year 10 work experience. Tom was particularly concerned about the quality of Australia's aged-care facilities, as this is an issue he has personally witnessed in his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, more than 1.3 million Australians access or use some form of aged care, with that number expected to grow to an estimated 3.5 million Australians by 2050. In light of the disturbing findings from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, we will continue to improve the aged-care system to protect older Australians. We have invested over $90 billion, to go into the sector over the next four years, to enable senior Australians to remain in their homes for longer, and to support their choices, have their needs better understood and improve their quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July, the Morrison government introduced new standards for residential aged care to improve transparency for senior Australians and their families, as well as making regulation clearer for providers. This will allow aspects of service provision to be measured in order to contribute to the quality of care for senior Australians. The standards are also used by providers as part of continuous improvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom feels strongly that it is our civil duty to care for older Australians, especially as Australia's population continues to age. I commend Tom for his passion on this issue. And thank you, Tom, for your work and enthusiasm in my office. Best of luck for your future studies.</span>

They committed zero towards local community priorities and infrastructure projects.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the election, I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and invited him to adopt Labor's plan for the region. Instead, what I got back was a letter outlining past projectsâprojects that were bipartisan and which have already been built. So it was not a plan for Bendigo at all but what had been done previously, including $45 million for the Calder Highway upgrade and the Ravenswood interchangeâa project committed to by Labor when we were last in government. And, if it weren't for the state Labor government, we wouldn't have it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was $5 million towards the Bendigo Airport upgrade stage 1. We asked for stage 2, but they're still talking about the past. The government has an opportunity in the MYEFO to commit to projects for Bendigo. It could commit to stage 2 of the airport: $5 million to upgrade the terminal. It could commit to funding the necessary Road Trauma Research Hub at La Trobe. It could commit to new projects for our region. At the moment this government has no plan, not just for electorates like Bendigo but for Ballarat and also for McEwen. It has forgotten parts of regional Victoria. Now is the time to commit.</span>

It's designed to deliver grants to community groups, with a separate fund for small businesses, to improve their energy efficiency.

The question has to be asked: are these expressions of interest the ones that will be prioritised? And will Labor-held seats be effectively excluded from the process because we haven't been given the inside running to meet the first come, first served criteria?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  Yesterday I had the great pleasure of opening the third annual Oakey Health and Wellbeing Expo in a community on the Darling Downs which has, like regional Australia elsewhere, dealt with its own challengesâquite literally from flooding a few years ago to the grips of drought right now, uncertainty about jobs going forward given delays in approvals for the Acland New Hope Stage 3 mine proposal and, of course, uncertainty around the impacts of PFAS. This expo focused on individual health and community wellbeing. I really want to congratulate the organisers; Bonnie Teschner, who was master of ceremonies on the day; Bec Meacham from the Oakey Chamber of Commerce; friends of mine, including Dr Eric Donaldson; the Oakey Men's Shed; physical and mental health experts; spiritual health experts; chiropractors; nutritionistsâyou name it. There was Nathan from the Oakey Discount Pharmacy, previously my own local pharmacy, and Ruth Logan, a great friend of our family, who, having been touched by cancer in her own family, now focuses so much on the It's a Bloke Thing Foundation's work on prostate health in men. It was great to be there with the state member for Condamine, Pat Weir; our mayor, Paul Antonio; and councillors, including Joe Ramierâall supporting the beautiful Oakey township on the Darling Downs, which will be resilient into the future and will realise its future despite the challenges.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, the drought coordinator was in attendance there, as the interjection from the member for Hunter indicates. He was actually central to the organisation of that Drought Summit. There were many members from this House present at that summit as well. That summit framed the drought response the government has continued to roll out since that time. Since that time, we have continued to listen very carefully, particularly through the minister for drought, to rural communities across the country to ensure that the response that we are continuing to provide is up to the mark in terms of the needs in rural and regional communities across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the House that that response has three components. The first of those components is to ensure the direct financial support and assistance, as is the responsibility of the Commonwealth under the National Drought Agreement, which was revised and updated after that Drought Summit, which made it very clear that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to look after the income support and other financial assistance to farm households and those communities. Issues such as fodder subsidies and freight subsidies and the direct care of animals and others involved in the welfare of the farms themselves is the responsibility of the states and territories. The reforms we've made to farm household allowance alone mean that, in a period over just over four years, with the announcement we made last week, individual farm households will have received, as couples, $125,000 in direct financial supportânot a loan but direct financial support over and above what they are able to earn in terms of off-farm incomeâand we lifted the threshold to up to $100,000 for off-farm income. That enables them, even with the off-farm income, to access the farm household allowance. There was support for drought affected communities through the Drought Communities Program. So it's not just about the farmers and graziers specifically; it's also about the communities that are affected. We've invested in over 120 councils and their shire areas to ensure that we're supporting the continuation of growth of their economies during difficult times, and of course we've invested in water resilience. That's our plan. We're getting on with it. We'll continue to get on with it, listening to farming communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. At the last election, Australians wanted to be able to plan for their future with confidence in what they knew would be uncertain times globally and, at times, domestically, when there would be many pressures on Australia, no less than the drought but also the many other pressures faced by families around the country. So they elected a government that they knew would be able to address those very difficult circumstances with stability, certainty and with measure and would do so in a way that was not afflicted by the policies of crisis but took a stable and calm approach that would enable them to get on and plan for their future with confidence. That's why we as a government are continuing to do that, maintaining the discipline in our budget management, which is the big reason we've been able to take the absolute fiscal wreckage that was left by the Labor Party and, over the last six years, painstakingly do the work to get expenditure under control and to make the choices necessary to get the budget back into a position to give this country resilience at a time when it needs it. We did that not just to deal with today, as we are doing when it comes to our record funding for hospitals and schools and to funding fully the National Disability Insurance Scheme and all of these programs such as mental health additional support, but also to ensure that for the future, as we move to two per cent of GDP in Defence Force funding as a result of the reforms we've put in place, we're providing for the future of the world. There is $100 billion in an infrastructure pipeline, new water infrastructureâ21 projects which are around the country today. Some $1.5 billion is being invested in those projects, many of which are underway even today. It is the stable, certain and calm approach that Australians have been looking for.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's there or how we are responding to the drought and ensuring, as I've just said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the programs we're delivering on the drought and providing that resource and support where it's needed, the stability and certainty in our engagement with the countries of our region, our partners and those further afield and our greatest allies, they have seen the stability and certainty in the approach that we've been taking. They've understood that Australia is a country that carries its own weight, that engages with its partners to form new trade agreements which not only expand opportunities for Australia but underpin the prosperity of our region.</span>

People should not be prosecuted for their profession. They should only be prosecuted if indeed they have been found to have fallen foul of the law. I do not believe that those decisions about who should be prosecuted at the end of the day should be made on the whim of politicians; I think they should be made based on the rule of law and the proper assessment of appropriately constituted law enforcement agencies.

                  </a>  The government believes absolutely in press freedoms in this country, and we have taken the step to add additional defences into our laws to ensure that journalists can get about their tasks. In fact, they are protections that exceed that which apply to many others around the country. Those were put in place by our government, not those opposite. I remember that, when those were in government, they sought to gag the press in this country. They sought to gag the press in this country with their failed media reforms. They wanted to implement a public interest test and a public interest media advocate to try to stifle the press in this country. I'm not going to take lectures from a Labor Party who sought in this place, when they were in government, to try to muzzle the press.</span>

I note also the statements from the commissioner of the AFP in the work that he is doing to review these matters. But I'll tell you what: if it comes to a position in this country where prime ministers and politicians decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn't get prosecuted without taking the appropriate advice and without seeing the appropriate proviso which are required under legislation, if we get to the point where the Leader of the Opposition wants to arbitrarily and outside the law decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn't, then that's not a country that I think Australians would want to live in.</span>

Five years before Federation, the Swan Hill Bridge was completed. This bridge is still operating today, although it needs repairs. When it does get those much-needed repairs, there will be interruption to traffic, and, of course, that affects the community. The Liberals and the Nationals, as part of our $100 billion nationwide infrastructure rollout over the next decade, are getting on and replacing the bridge. The local mayor, Anne Young, is absolutely delighted with what she is doing. The member for Mallee and I were there when Councillor Young described replacing the Swan Hill Bridge as 'a budget winner'. A budget winner, indeed! I'm sure the Treasurer would have been delighted to hear those words. Councillor Young also said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government has already invested heavily in our region, and this bridge funding is the icing on the cake â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The bridge has been a long term aspiration of our community, and this funding will help us achieve a new bridge much sooner.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, she is right. There has been a lot of funding going into the member for Mallee's electorate, because she is a fighter, she is determined and she wants her community to be the best it can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's the member for Mallee's or any other electorate right across this country, they are all benefiting from having a budget going towards surplus. They're benefiting towards our delivery of infrastructure across this nation. We have committed funding to thousands of projects across the country, including up to 900 major projects, of which 280 are already completed and some 160 are already under construction. That's delivery. Of course, we work with the states and territories to make sure that this funding becomes a reality.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member for Mallee's electorate, we've committed $350 million through the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative across six projects, and we will deliver this in full. We've put funding on the table to make sure that these crucial freight-enhancing projects are possible. The member for Wright knows this, because in his portfolio area he hears every day how important these regional roads are not just for road safety but also for freight supply chains. In Tasmania, we've commenced construction on the Murchison Highway corridor upgrade, with bridge strengthening along the corridor already complete. Labor would never have designed an initiative such as the Roads of Strategic Importance.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The member for Mallee asked me about the opposition to this. I'm looking at the opposition. It would never have happened under Labor, because they don't care about the regions, and less do they care about infrastructure in the regions and those important roads. Not necessarily national highways, but the byways which provide such vital linkage pointsâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's moneys that are hitting right across the country. In addition to that, the tax cuts that were legislated by this government, fought against by the Labor Party, who said these shouldn't happenâin fact, the Labor Party argued at the election that we should be imposing $387 billion of higher taxes on the Australian economy. I don't know what sort of a stimulus package $387 billion of higher taxes constitutes, but that was the prescription that was offered by the shadow Treasurer when he was the shadow finance minister and he was the joint architect with the former shadow Treasurer and the former Leader of the Opposition, who said they thought at this time of great uncertainty in the global economy that adding $387 billion to the tax burden of Australians would be a good idea.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't share that view. We believe, and we have demonstrated in our budget, that the right way to go about addressing the issues in the global economy and, indeed, in the domestic economy is the stable and considered approach of rolling out our program of reducing the costs of doing business, whether it's on removing unnecessary regulation, ensuring that we're training people for the skills needs of the future, delivering tax relief to Australians, taking our trade barriers further out to ensure that we're dealing with more and more countries in the world and taking our trade agreements coverage from 26 per cent to 70 per cent, and we're seeking to go further. So that is the economic plan that we took to the election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party would have us engage in the reckless spending policies that they last implemented when the member who asked the question sat at the knee of Wayne Swan and instituted one of the most reckless spending packages, which crashed the budget and took money away from things like pharmaceuticals, defence spending and a whole range of other important priorities because the Labor Party did not know how to manage money.

                <span class="HPS-Small">the Australian economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently, but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook.

Foodbank is the largest provider of vital food and groceries to food relief charities around Australia. These charities provide relief to over 815,000 Australians each month, including people in Warringah and, importantly, farmers affected by the drought. Two hundred and fifty-two tonnes of food and groceries were shipped out of the Foodbank New South Wales warehouse last week alone, and 110 tonnes went to regional and remote areas in New South Wales. Yet Foodbank is not receiving any emergency funding to meet increased demand. Will the government increase funding to Foodbank and support a food security strategy as part of Australia's response to climate change?</span>

Particularly as part of our drought program, we are working with a whole host of different charitable organisations. We have provided over $50 million, in fact, to organisations like the Salvos, Vinnies and othersâthe Country Women's Associationâto ensure that we are providing the support we can.

That of course is not the only food relief program that the Commonwealth government, the Morrison government, supports. We also provide funding for two other significant charities in this area: SecondBite and OzHarvest. These are all important measures designed to provide support to needy Australians, vulnerable Australians. And of course we continue to work with these important agencies for the delivery of this funding and continue to work with them and a whole range of other agencies to support Australians affected by drought.</span>

The meetings of the IMF, G20 and World Bank came at an important time for the global economy, as we are going through a synchronised slowdown, with the IMF downgrading the global forecast to three per cent for 2019. The mood at the meetings was serious but not panicked, as countries the world over are getting used to a world, an economy, with low interest rates, low inflation and relatively low unemployment.</span>

But certainly the comments from both the Americans and Chinese at this meeting were more positive than we've heard before.</span>

Balanced budgets and surplus budgets help build the resilience of the Australian economy to external shocks, whenever they may occur.</span>

We know they proposed $387 billion of higher taxes, which would be hitting Australians from 1 July this year. We know that they can't manage money, because even when iron ore had a price that was more than double of what it is today, they still couldn't deliver a surplus budget.</span>

Part of our $100 billion infrastructure pipeline is a $4 billion Urban Congestion Fund. This Urban Congestion Fund provides key money to support and bust the congestion at local pinch points in the suburbs in our large capital cities. We know it is not just the pace of the freeways which matters; it's also getting through those congested intersections to get on to the major arterials. We have targeted funding, 166 projects across our big capital cities, which we will be investing in. As the member for Ballarat knows, we announced these 166 projects in the lead-up to the federal election. The vast majority of the funding kicked off on 1 July of this particular year. We have begun work with the states and territories on every single one of those projects. In fact, as the member for Ballarat may not be aware, we've already announced with the South Australian government the time schedule associated with each of the projects in South Australia. We've already announced with the Brisbane City Council the time schedule and the delivery schedule for all of those projectsâ</span>

                  </a>  We already have agreements with the South Australian government. We have agreements for some of the Queensland projects. My expectation is that we'll soon have agreements, in every single other jurisdiction where we have Urban Congestion Fund projects underway, which will outline when these projects will start and when they'll be completed. I must say that all of those discussions are going well. They're constructive, and the state governments share our desire to get these projects underway as quickly as possible. In fact, even last night, Jacinta Allan, the Victorian transport minister, was quoted on Channel Nine as saying, 'From our perspective, we're working as quickly as possible on these projects.' So, we share our desire to get these done, as does the transport minister of Victoria, as does the transport minister in Queensland, and as do other ministers right across the country. The first ones will begin early next year and then they'll be rolling out, busting congestion across the country. But, of course, these things do take time. You do a public consultation. There's a design process. There's a feasibility study. You have to go out and have competitive tenders. The member for Ballarat may not understand this, but we do. We want to get them done. We will follow due process. The member for Ballarat doesn't understand due process, either, when it comes to administering departments, as we know from last time.</span>

When we came to government, unemployment was rising, investment was falling and we know that the Australian economy was not heading for a surplus budget, as it is today. Australia is now in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. We have a credit rating of AAA. We have the first current account surplus since 1975. Welfare dependency is at a 30-year low and we have seen nearly 1.5 million jobs created since we came to government. In fact, in the last jobs numbers, for the first time ever we saw jobs growth in each month for the last three years. We have a record number of Australians in work, a record number of women in work and a record participation rate. In fact, employment growth is more than three times what we inherited from the Labor Party and more than double the OECD average.</span>

We know that the former member for Lilley and mentor to the now member for Rankin said this: 'It's important that our political leaders work hard to build confidence in our economy and not be out there talking down the economy.' Yet that is what the Leader of the Opposition did last week. He compared the Australian economy to Greece's. Shame on you, Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition used the language of the GFC.</span>

That is what the peak business community of Australia has said. We will continue to deliver strong jobs growth, we will continue to preside over an economy that is growing in its 29th year, and we will continue to lower taxes so that Australians can earn more and keep more of what they earn. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On Friday I was pleased to sit down with the Premier of Victoria. For the last several months I have been working closely with the Premier of Victoria, as has the minister for congestion bustingâmore formally known as the minister for urban infrastructureâand the minister for infrastructure has been sitting down with all of our state and territory colleagues to ensure that we both bring forward projects and get the time lines and agreements set. This has also involved the provision of additional funds invested, in particular, in Victoria. I've been very pleased to work closely with the Premier of Victoria and to make so much progress to ensure that both governments can work together to deliver these projects in the years ahead. The opposition may want to engage in the theatre of politics on these matters, but the Premier of Victoria and I are engaging in the business of delivery of infrastructure projects in Victoria. I'll invite the minister for infrastructure to add to my answer.</span>

I thank the member for Jagajaga; I am always happy to have you come down and get a personal briefing from me about projects in your area. That goes for all those in the opposition; I am always happy to chat about our $100 billion infrastructure pipeline and what we're doing individually in each and every one of your own electorates. There have been plenty of takers, and I'm thankful that the member for Bendigo has taken the time, effort and trouble to come to me and ask about what's going on in her rural Victorian electorate. Indeed, just last week, Jacinta Allan, the infrastructure and roads minister in Victoria, talked glowingly in question time about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state government on getting on with infrastructure projects in Victoria. We will continue to make sure that we roll out infrastructure. Indeed, as far as urban congestion is going, the government has committed funding to 26 projects in Victoriaâthis is excluding commuter car parksâtotalling $874.9 million.

                  </a>  We are getting on with planning. We're working with the Victorian government. You can't build these things overnight; I know the member opposite thought he built the pyramids overnight. In the member's electorate, there is the M80 Ring Road upgrade, the North East Link, and the south eastern roads and northern roads projects. They're the sorts of things we're getting on with to benefit Jagajaga and to benefit Victorians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I thank the member for Barker for his question and I acknowledge his deep insight and advocacy for emissions intensive businesses in regional areas because they are crucial to regional Australia. When we arrived into government in 2013, we were faced with not just a financial deficit but a deficit in achieving emission reductions and abatement, because they left us with a 700 million tonne deficit versus our 2020 targets. We now know, from the hard work done by this government and by hardworking Australian businesses and industry, that we'll overachieve on that target by 367 million tonnes. That's a 1.1 billion tonne turnaround. We haven't just turned around their financial deficit; we have turned around their abatement deficit. As we look forward to 2030, we've laid out to the last tonne how we're going to achieve our emissions obligations through our $3Â½ billion Climate Solutions Package. That's the centrepiece. We'll do this while growing the economy. So we have a clear policy that is delivering results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are receiving endorsements for this policy from unusual quarters and unusual places. The member for Hunter has endorsed our policies. The member for Burt has joined with him. It's not just them. The WA state Labor government has said that the government won the election and has a mandate to follow its policies through. On the weekend, the Australian Workers Unionâa place that's generated many of those opposite into this placeâendorsed our policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst we're in lock step with the Australian people and hardworking Australian businesses right across this country, those opposite are for hollow symbolism and empty gestures. We don't yet know what their policies are, but they have followed the Greens to support a climate emergency. The question is: what do they mean by that? The Greens have belled the cat in the Senate, and they have defined a climate emergency. Do you know what it is? No oil, no gas, no coal, no Adani, no Beetaloo and no hope for Australia under those policies. It means terminating literally tens of thousands of jobs. It seems those opposite are taking a leaf out of Extinction Rebellion's playbook and are gluing themselves to their old mates in the Greens.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Before I call the member for Oxley, I think this is important information for members of the House, following the Leader of the Opposition's last attempted point of order. I'm going to make it very clear to the House, just so members understand. It's been the practice of speakers for many decades now to be very liberal when it comes to the practice of interpreting the standing orders with questions. Just so that members are clear, the rules for questions, as the Leader of the Opposition outlined, in standing order 100 include that questions must not be debated, and they also must not contain arguments, inferences, imputations, insults, ironical expressions or hypothetical matter. If the opposition want me to enforce that, I think they will find it very difficult to ask any questions at all. I would just make that point.</span>

I have asked Mark Bailey, the minister responsible, to bring forward projects. We're getting on with making sure that we build the roads, build the ports and do everything that we need to do, as a government, to build a better Queensland. We're getting on with the job of making sure that, if it comes to Queensland, or, indeed, to any state or territory, we're building Roads of Strategic Importance. Those opposite wouldn't ever have funded a program such as Roads of Strategic Importance, because they never ever worried about a regional programâunless they could rort it.

Eight have already undergone significant planning work and local consultationâand that is important. When you build a road, you have to conduct local consultation. That's already been undertaken, including on the Toowoomba to Seymour corridor, through the Newell Highway strategy; the Barton Highway; Karratha to Tom Priceâappreciating that not all of these are in Queensland, Member for Oxley!

When we fund it, it's an 80-20 split with states or territories; for those opposite, invariably it is just fifty-fifty. So that's a significant saving for those states in those areas where we're funding road progress.</span>

The member is aware, as I am and as the Prime Minister is, that, amongst the many contentious issues inside the industrial relations system, the system itself is actually full of a range of practical problems that are looking for practical solutions, and, as the member is aware, industrial relations plays a critically important and central role in contributing to the strength of the Australian economy. As the member is also aware, the Morrison government has undertaken to clearly identify ways in which we can increase productivity and make the IR system more efficient and fairer for both employers and employees, the idea being that we need to find ways, where there is a consensus that can be built around policy changes, that would put upward pressure on wages and make businesses stronger and help them to employ more people. In discussing just one of those potential areas for improvement, I might use some words spoken by the former Leader of the Opposition before the last election, when the member for Maribyrnong said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We want to look at the ability for companies to negotiate with unions for extended greenfields agreements, project life, you can go to the global investors who will back it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very, very good idea. Enterprise agreements are a critical part of the system. They allow flexibility and they're particularly important in the mining and resources sector, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland. In the last parliament, there was a decline in EAs because of the fact that many of them were being invalidated by minor technical issues. Literally it was the case that enterprise agreements were being invalidated if they had a mistaken document stapled to the back of them on submission. This was causing immense problemsâinefficiency, waste, costâfor business. In the last parliament, we brought in legislation so that it was the caseâ</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PORTER:</span>
                  </a>  Indeed, and I congratulate you for supporting it. This is about finding other things that we can do together to make the system more efficient. That has definitely worked to make the system more efficient. The number of days that it was taking to conclude an enterprise agreement has dropped from 76 in the last seven months to 34. That saves business money and helps business become more efficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when we have these big projects, if it is the case, as we have suggested in a recent discussion paper, we can find consensus about how to have enterprise agreements for the life of those projects. These are projects like Woodside's Burrup Hub natural gas project, which will create on average 4,000 jobs a year, every year for decades. These are the projects that are more likely to get across the line from banking feasibility stage to reality if we can provide them with the ability to negotiate an enterprise agreement for the life of the projects. This is one of two discussion papers, the other being about how to properly define wage theft. And we look very much forward to talking about these with the opposition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:52</span>):  As members opposite would know, the program and schedule of projects which the government pursues is one that is put together in partnership with the states and territories as we seek to implement that plan. And, indeed, even if it's with local government on projects that we pursue, our job is to ensure that we provide the allocation of the funds, set the priority projects and sit down with the state and territory governments. Those opposite would knowâparticularly the Leader of the Opposition would know from his time when he served as a minister for infrastructureâthat the scheduling of projects is set out together with the states and territories, and the profile for the delivery of those projects is often revised based on the advice provided by the states and territories. That is why the changes in the schedule arrive as they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I make this point, though: under our government, this year, we will spend about $10 billion on infrastructure. That is what is budgeted to be spent in this very financial year all around the country. Now, that's almost double what we inherited from the Labor Party when we came to government. The Leader of the Opposition, who sits at the table now, had committed, from memoryâand I would be happy to stand corrected on this figureâaround $6 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, we're spending $10 billion or thereabouts, just slightly less than that, and the reason we're doing that is because, two budgets ago, we decided to put in place the $75 billion pipeline of projects over 10 years. In the last budget, recognising the difficult situation that we're facing in the global economy, we increased that pipeline of investments over the next 10 years to $100 billion. We upped it, because we knew that's what the Australian economy would need, not just now, but over the next 10 years. More important than that, we have the budget discipline to back those sorts of commitments up. So the reason for any change in schedules is not a lack of fiscal capacity or discipline because of this government; any changes to scheduling is in relation to our negotiations with the states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when those opposite are in government, the reason they cut defence spending, the reason they don't list pharmaceuticals, the reason they have to strike flood levies and all of those sorts of things is that they never know how to manage money. That is why at the last election Australians knew they could trust this government to deliverâbecause they know they can trust us to manage money.</span>

The Morrison government has a strong record of identifying, investing in and delivering what makes and keeps Australians safe at home and abroad. It's important to provide certainty to our defence industry in order to create jobs, to create those defence industry opportunities and, at the same time, to keep Australians safe. We're very proud that, because of our government's strong economic management, we are now restoring defence spending to two per cent of GDP, reversing the significant decline that the nation experienced under Labor. We will achieve the two per cent of GDP in the 2020-21 period, which is three years before predicted. Of course, this is due to the good economic management of those sitting on this side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been asked about alternative policies. Under Labor, defence was an unacceptable casualty of the inability of those opposite to manage money. In six years, Labor did not commission a single Australian-built ship. There are many new members on this side of the House and on the other side of the House and they may have thought that they misheard me, so I think it's worth repeating that, in six years, Labor did not commission a single Australian-built ship. By contrast, the Morrison government will build 57 vessels in Australia, built in Australia by 15,000 Australian workers using Australian steel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012-13 Labor slashed the defence budget by over 10 per cent in real terms, causing defence investment to fall to its lowest level since World War II. Because of Labor's panic and crisis, Labor cut $18 billion from the defence budget whilst they were in government. Labor's cuts caused Australia's defence industry to cut thousands of Australian jobs and, at the same time, place our defence capability at risk.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure,Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:00</span>):  I'm happy to provide an update to the opposition leader about all of those projects. But, rest assured, we're getting on with the job of building a better future, building a better Australia. When it comes to providing funding for projects, there are many, many members who are delighted to get the infrastructure that their electorates need. Certainly, when it comes to regional programs, there is the black spot funding, the tripling of Roads to Recovery and that sort of funding, which is provided to local councils where they can make the decisions at a local level, and that is so important. That is the difference, perhaps, between the Liberals and the Nationals and what we saw over six years under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years when the member who asked me the question, the opposition leader, the member for Grayndler, was the infrastructure minister. I know he would have been absolutely thrilled to have the sort of infrastructure spend that we have been investing in on this side of the House since we came to government in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And not only are we providing that infrastructure spend but the rubber is actually hitting the road. We are getting on with the job. If there is one thing that those opposite could do when there are projects and programs that they feel are necessary, it is pick the phone up, particularly to their Labor infrastructure ministers at a state level, and ask what they are also doing to work in conjunction with the Commonwealth to make sure that we get these programs and projects delivered. That would be a great start. We have had good support, I have to say, whether it's been from Mark Bailey in Queensland or Jacinta Allan in Victoria. They are two Labor ministers prepared to come to the table. I know that the Prime Minister met with Premier Daniel Andrews just last Friday. We want to build infrastructure. We need to build infrastructure. Indeed, we're getting on with the job of building infrastructure. The Australian government is spending, as I say, $100 billion over a 10-year pipeline of investment. The 2019-20 budget included $23 billion of new commitments, including $2.6 billion for Queensland, $6.1 billion for New South Wales, more than $6 billion in Victoria, $933 million for Western Australia, $1.8 billion for South Australia, $68 million for Tasmania, $60 million for the Northern Territory and $50 million for the Australian Capital Territory. That's investment, that's delivery, that's the future, that's building a better future for Australians. That's the Liberals' and Nationals' way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. He understands that this drought has spread like a cancerâfirst up in my part of the world, in my electorate, some seven years ago, then into the Northern Territory, now into New South Wales and Victoria, and even into Tasmania and across into South Australia. But our response has been ongoing. This isn't new; this has been ongoing. We continue to support. Tackling drought is like going up a set of stairs: every time it escalates you take another step, and that's what this government does in response to this drought. We've made sure that we've brought all the stakeholders with us, particularly after the National Drought Summit, to make sure that the commitment of the states and the Commonwealth is agreed, and we continue to have that unanimous and bipartisan approach to it. The states look after animal welfare, freight and fodder; we look after farmer welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our response has been predicated on three core pillars. The first pillar is about the here and now. We're giving our farmers the dignity and respect that they deserve by giving them the farm household allowanceâ$120,000 in farm support, money in their pocketsâgiving them the dignity to be able to have household expenses paid for them. We're creating an environment around them with rural financial councillors to help them make decisive decisions about their future, the strategic decisions about their future. We're also giving them the ability to access low-interest loans, saving them tens of thousands of dollars, putting money back into their pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pillar is about the community. We understand this drought goes beyond the farmgate; it goes into the local economies, so we've empowered local councils to have local solutions, not Canberra solutions, to how we stimulate these local economies. We're getting projects that use local tradies using local materials from the local hardware store. But we also understand the mental health impacts, and we're making sure there are targeted mental health programs put into these communities. For the first time, we're thinking about the future. We're thinking about preparing for the next drought, taking the next step in terms of drought policy. That's been done in the past through over $500 million a year in tax concessions to farmers to help them prepare in the good years by putting away their money through farm management depositsâthey're now able to offset that against their term debtsâand also by building the infrastructure that stores the fodder to build the resilience. But it's also around the future fundâmaking sure there's a dividend to equip them with the tools to prepare for the next drought through research and development extension work so that they understand what is available for them, the tools they need and the new science and cutting-edge technology being prepared for the next one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third pillar is around the infrastructure. We're providing them with the water infrastructure to build resilience and to have a longer lag period between droughts. We're harvesting the water when it comes to give them a red-hot crack at getting through the next drought. Our job as a federal government is to put the environment and infrastructure around them. That's what our three-pillar policy is about. We're standing with them, shoulder to shoulder, saying, 'It will rain,' and, when it does rain, we will be there to protect them in the bad and the good years.</span>

We all know what happens when you roll out an infrastructure program too quickly because we saw it with Labor in government time after time. We know what happens when you shovel that money out of the door with no policy, no guidelines, no procurement. Two hundred and sixty million dollars has been dedicated to the upgrade of Kakadu. I was there recently. The traditional owners are very happy with the process. The tourism initiatives that are starting, they're very happy with the process. We've got good relationships with the Northern Territory government. We're not playing politics about this. How could you come into this place and talk this sort of nonsense? Honestly, the member for Lingiari should know better.</span>

In addition to her advocacy on that front, prior to coming to this place she worked with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and understood, through her work there, and advocated for the importance of a stable, balanced approach to the economy. One of the reasons why, of course, is that she witnessed, in 2011, the then government unable to fund critical medicines for conditions such as endometriosis and IVF treatment. Fortunately, however, we are in a very different place today, a place where over 2,200 new or amended medicines have been listed under this government, including on the weekend with the announcement that new medicines for cystic fibrosis will be listed. In particular, ORKAMBI will now be extended to children between the ages of two and fiveâbeautiful young childrenâand for the first time SYMDECO will be made available for children aged from 12 years up and adults.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this important? These new medicines are life extending, life improving, life saving and would otherwise cost $250,000 a year. They would be beyond the reach of virtually every Australian family. It is expected that these medicines, which will be available on the PBS from 1 December, will help over 1,400 patients. Instead of $250,000, they will now be available for $6.50 or $40.30.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, we've managed to negotiate immediate compassionate access for free from today. That's immensely important for these young peopleâimmensely important for children such as Xavier, who I met yesterday. He is five years old. Last night, I received an email from Dr Sonia Marshall. To the best of my knowledge, I've not previously met Sonia. She said: 'Dear Greg, what fantastic news you delivered this morning about SYMDECO and ORKAMBI. There are lots of tears of joy in our house this morning. There are no words adequate enough to thank the Australian government for the role they are playing in changing the future for those with cystic fibrosis. My almost 14-year-old daughter has been taking ORKAMBI for 13 months. It has completely changed her life. It's changed our lives beyond recognition. Before ORKAMBI, Evie would spend 13 hours a day doing CF treatments. After ORKAMBI, it takes only 45 minutes a day.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the related bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a nation of 25 million people in a world of over 7Â½ billion. This simple statement has always underpinned the economic imperative of expanding international trade for Australian prosperity. We are a relatively small economy, with industries that rely on exports in order to thriveâprimary industries like agriculture and mining but also, in recent times, service industries like education and tourism. As a result, it's no surprise that one in five Australian jobs rely on trade. Labor has always understood this. Our support of Australian jobs through trade is not a new thing. Indeed, it was a core part of what was called the positive approachâthe approach of Labor leaders like John Curtin and Ben Chifleyâto shaping the international arrangements that govern our future after the Second World War in the interests of working Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chifley fought for full employment in Australia, and he championed international arrangements that would help in that fight, building international trade and Labor agreements that improved the living standards of Australians and ensured we were able to provide a stronger safety net. It's why Chifley fought some on his own side in politics to champion Australia's membership of the IMF, the World Bank and GATT. It's why he fought Robert Menzies to secure Australia's ratification of the GATT agreements against the opposition of the conservatives. More than any other international agreement, it was these GATT agreements, ratified by Chifley against the opposition of Menzies, that underpinned Australia's economic prosperity in the second half of the 20th century. Chifley understood that Australian trade meant Australian jobs, and the great Labor prime ministers who followed him understood this too. That's why Whitlam unilaterally reduced tariffs and why the Hawke-Keating government led the foundation of APEC and championed Australian interests through subsequent GATT negotiations via the Cairns Group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly important that we get this right and we understand this fundamental truth in our trade relationship with Indonesia. Our neighbour and the home of more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the world's third-largest democracy, one with which we share many strategic interests in a rapidly changing Indo-Pacific region. Economically, Indonesia is forecast to become the fourth-largest economy in the world and will have a consumer class of 135 million people by 2030. As Paul Keating once said, 'There is no country more important to Australia than Indonesia.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a strong economic partnership with Indonesia is crucial to Australia's future prosperity. It's why we come here in this place. Labor has always understood the importance of Indonesia to Australia's future. In 2007, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd initiated the joint feasibility study with Indonesia to kickstart the process of getting a free trade agreement with Indonesia. In 2013, also when Labor was in government, negotiations for the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or IA-CEPA, began. This agreement is long overdue. The bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia was agreed back in 1993, under another Labor government. There has been a fair bit of change since then though. In the early nineties, 30 per cent of Indonesia's GDP was from agriculture. Now it's half that, at 15 per cent. Almost 70 per cent of the Indonesian population are now connected to the internet, and 71 million Indonesians enthusiastically use social media next door. Since the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia has experienced two decades of uninterrupted growth of at least five per cent per annum. It's one of the fastest-growing middle-class populations in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement is long overdue, because, despite Indonesia's growth over the last 20 years, the economic potential of Australia's trade and investment relationship with Indonesia has not been realised. Only two per cent of Australia's trade is with Indonesiaâour northern neighbour, a future giant of the world economyâand there has been almost no growth in this figure over the last 10 years. Indeed, Indonesia is not even one of our top 10 trading partners. Incredibly, trade volumes between Australia and Indonesia are the lowest of any neighbouring states in the G20. We do more trade with New Zealand, a country of a mere four million people, than we do with our northern neighbour with a population of more than 250 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be frank that a large part of the blame for this situation lies on the Australian side. For too long we have shown too little interest in Indonesia. This is reflected in something as simple as the number of Australians studying Bahasa Indonesia, the language of our northern neighbour. While schools like Williamstown High School in my electorate have fought tooth and nail to retain their Bahasa Indonesia language programs over many years now, the sad reality is that there are fewer Australians studying Bahasa Indonesia today than when Gough Whitlam was our Prime Minister, at a time when Indonesia's primacy in both Australia's security and economic future was in greater question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports IA-CEPA because it establishes a foundation for a bilateral partnership that forges Australia and Indonesia as an economic powerhouse in the Indo-Pacific region. This means more jobs in Australia, more opportunities for Australian businesses and more money in the Australian economy, across education, mining, steel and agriculture. This agreement is a gateway for one of Australia's largest export industries: education. The agreement guarantees that Australian suppliers of certain technical and vocational education and training can provide services through majority Australian owned businesses in Indonesia. Also, Australian universities, which already have more than 118 formal agreements with Indonesian universities, will be allowed to open campuses in Indonesia. At a time when we talk about the strategic imperative for Australian universities to diversify the sources of their export industries, this agreement is good news. Extraordinarily, in 2018 Australia received more students from Malaysia than from Indonesia, despite Indonesia's population being nearly 10 times larger. This is a real opportunity. If Australia were to receive the same proportion of students from Indonesia as Malaysia, this would add around 150,000 additional students, growing the Australian education export market, and equating approximately to an additional $11 billion in exports for the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The growth of Indonesia's middle class and its increasing industrialisation also provide an opportunity for Australia's resources industry. The agreement the legislation before the House implements reduces tariffs and locks in progressive tariff quotas for major exports to Indonesia. Indonesia has not previously made commitments in a trade agreement on mining services of this kind. This is of significant importance to Australia. Under IA-CEPA, Australian companies can own up to 67 per cent of mining companies based in Indonesiaâup from 49 per cent. Under this agreement, Indonesia will guarantee import permits for 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year, meaning more Australian jobs in the Australian steelworking industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian grain industry is also facing tough times. It expects wheat exports to be up to 25 per cent lower this year due to drought. IA-CEPA will be crucial in making sure that the Australian grain industry is in a position to recover market share in Indonesia quickly when the industry's prospects improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is the good news. That's the opportunity story presented by this agreement, but, as the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, made clear in his speech to this chamber earlier, all of the details of this agreement are not the details that we would have included if we were the ones sitting opposite negotiating this agreement. Despite all the benefits and the opportunities that I have talked about in relation to this agreement, we need to ensure that IA-CEPA is good news for all Australians. We need to safeguard the interests of Australian workers. This is a significant issue. Since the global financial crisis, unemployment in Australia has risen from around four per cent to around 5.3 per cent. Underemployment has also increased. It went from less than six per cent before the GFC to 8.4 per cent. More than a million Australians are underemployed, wanting to work more but not able to get the opportunity. That's why Labor has demandedâand the government has agreed to it, in writingâto specific commitments on the implementation of this agreement in order to protect Australian jobs and Australian working conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is a recommendation made by the members of the JSCOT that the government not use article 12.9 or any other provisions in IA-CEPA to propose, create or extend any additional labour testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service providers. This morning, the government agreed to Labor's request on this. It means that any future negotiations with Indonesia will not undermine Australian workplace laws and will include appropriate workplace labour market testing and actual skills assessments, both features being critical to protecting Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, under the free-movement provisions an increase in working holiday visas is provided for by this agreement, something that's quite good, I should point out. One of the disadvantages of the Australia-Indonesia relationship is the lack of that diaspora community in Australiaâpeople with experience of living in both countries. So increasing the numbers of people, both Australians and Indonesians, who have experience living in the other country is an important priority to the Australia-Indonesia relationship. But it's important that this not be used to facilitate the exploitation of temporary foreign migrant workers. Australians are right to be worried given the endemic exploitation of people in Australia working under temporary work visas under this government in recent years. This is a legitimate concern and a real scandal in Australia in recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sought and the government agreed that any Indonesian nationals utilising the additional work and holiday visas in IA-CEPA are treated equally under Australian workplace laws and should be licensed and qualified for any work they undertake in our country. Not only that, but they ought to be informed of their rights under Australian workplace laws. One of the great scandals that we have seen in recent times is the securitisation of Australian immigration policyâthe relentless focus only on how to keep people out of this country and inadequate attention paid to the experiences of people coming to this country to work. If we had been paying more attention to this settlement process of new arrivals in recent years, perhaps we would have caught the endemic exploitation that's been going on that all members of this House will have heard of in their electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, IA-CEPA includes modernised and improved investor-state dispute settlement clauses and includes safeguards of public health, environment and prudential regulations, crucially replacing existing provisions providing for investor-state dispute settlement processes of this kind in the existing bilateral agreement. Under these new ISDS clauses, Philip Morris would not have been able to sue the Australian government for its plain-packaging legislation introduced by my predecessor in this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the agreements with Hong Kong and Peru, the IA-CEPA did not terminate the existing bilateral investment treaty, the existing arrangement between Australia and Indonesia, despite the JSCOT recommending that Australia pursue termination of the survival clause in this agreement. Labor sought and the government has agreed in writing that it accepts the bipartisan JSCOT recommendation on termination and that the government also review the recent ISDS mechanisms across all recent agreements as part of the scheduled five-year review of IA-CEPA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sought confirmation from the government that there is no inference from IA-CEPA or any other free trade agreements that would require the privatisation of government services nor restrict any future decision to acquire public assets. To maintain public trust, it's crucial that any free trade agreements, any agreements of an international nature, impose no external obligations on privatisation of government services, subverting the democratic process in this country. That's not what's going on here, and I welcome the government's assurance on that front. It is also why the government has agreed to Labor's request to implement the JSCOT recommendation that it will consider the use of economic modelling analysis in an overall JSCOT inquiry into all aspects of Australia's treaty-making process in relation to trade. Independent modelling and analysis of proposed trade agreements should be undertaken as a matter of course for future trade and economic partnerships. And any member of this House who has served on JSCOT in the past will know that this has been a frequent and ongoing complaint from members of that committee. Improving transparency and public consultation on how the government enters into treaties with foreign countries is crucial for maintaining public trust in our democratic institutions and in free trade more generally. It's important that we make the case for these agreements to the Australian public and bring them along with us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a long history of supporting and promoting trade between Australia and the rest of the world. Our industries benefit from trade through increased competition. Our consumers benefit through lower prices and greater choice. Our workers benefit through higher pay and more jobs. Australia benefits from trade. It has always been thus. Australian businesses that export, on average, hire 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. Australian household incomes are estimated to be an average of around $8,500 higher as a result of opening up new markets through trade. But we do need to ensure that free trade agreements benefit all Australians, and the changes to this agreement, the implementation commitments Labor has sought, deliver this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  I take this opportunity to follow members on this side of the House in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and related bill and the amendment moved by the member for Brand. This is a really important time for the House to consider new trade deals with Indonesia, with Hong Kong and with Peru. Nobody in here needs reminding about the very serious challenges in the global economy, particularly as they relate to trade, with trade tensions between the Chinese and the Americans and trade tensions between the Japanese and the South Koreans. Of course, there's also Brexit, and there's a fairly robust debate going on about the relevance and the rules of the World Trade Organization.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ideally, the region and the world could get together and make high-quality multilateral agreements, to the ultimate benefit of all the economies of the world. Ideally, we could seek common ground for the common good when it comes to trade arrangements, and those arrangements would have as many nations involved as possible. Unfortunately, progress on the multilateral front has been slow in recent times; so we are left with bilateral deals, like the ones we are debating in the parliament today. They are, frankly, better than nothing when it comes to finding new ways and new markets for our goods, and new jobs and opportunities for our people. When economic growth is not exactly thick on the ground in Australia at the moment, we look for and we take the growth where we can get itâbecause growth means jobs, which means opportunities for people. These agreements, though imperfectâthey always areâdo give Australia and Australians an opportunity to reach out to some important neighbours, especially Indonesia, to ensure that we are trading more and that we can become mutually more prosperous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the House is aware, the bills implement the tariff cuts agreed to by the government as part of the Hong Kong agreement, the Indonesia agreement and the Peru agreement. All we in this House are being asked to do is vote on the tariff arrangements rather than the full deals struck between governments. As the Leader of the Opposition outlined in his contribution, we don't debate the deal in this place; we debate and vote on the accompanying tariff reductionsâand that is what we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From our point of view, the most strategically and economically important one of the three agreementsânot to diminish the othersâis obviously the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It has five core areas: goods, electronic commerce, skills development, investment and services. If you are looking for a summary of the nature of the change to the Indonesian trading arrangements it is that over 99 per cent of Australian goods exports to Indonesia will enter duty free or under significantly improved or preferential arrangements. In particular, the components of the Indonesian agreement around steel, agriculture and technical and vocational education really stand out as the big opportunities for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth acknowledging that, when it comes to agreements like these, they are always on-balance calls. There is always an obligation for us on this side of the House to weigh up all of the pros and cons and come to an on-balance call. After lots of consultation and lots of discussion, we decided to support these deals for four reasons that I want to run through this afternoon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we support these deals because bigger markets mean more jobs for our people. We back our workers to do well out of the new opportunities created by the changing nature of these markets and these agreements. We want bigger markets because we want more and better jobs. In a nutshell, that's one of the reasons that we are supporting these deals. There are also big benefits for agriculture, mining and education. As other members have pointed out, a very interesting stat is that, on average, Australian businesses that export hire 23 per cent more staff and pay 11 per cent higher wages, with their labour productivity 13 per cent higher than nonexporters. I think that says something about the businesses which can grasp these opportunities afforded by new deals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One in five Australians are employed in trade related employment. Australian household incomes are something like $8,500 higher, on average, as a result of opening up new markets through trade. Again, as other members on this side have pointed out in their contributions today, Labor is the party of trade. Labor is the party of seeking out and benefiting from new markets. I was very pleased to hear the member for Gellibrand talk about Ben Chifley's contribution in the postwar yearsâsuch an important role for an Australian at the time, in being part of the discussions that led to the general agreement, as part of his engagement, really, right across the board when it came to the new postwar institutions of international engagement. We on this side do have a lot to be proud of when it comes to trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to touch on what these bills don't do. I think it's easy to make assumptions about debates and agreements like this. It's important to very clearly understand that none of these agreements include provisions that require the privatisation of any public services. None of them include provisions that undermine the PBS. All of them preserve our WTO antidumping rights. None of them include provisions that will limit the right of the Commonwealth to regulate in the interests of public welfare or safe products. The agreements don't require any legislative change with respect to our procurement arrangements. None of them explicitly exempt any category of people from Australian laws and regulations. They do not lower Australia's standards to facilitate the entry of foreign workers. AndâI think very importantly for our considerationsâall three agreements improve on the level of investment protections and public interest safeguards, when you compare them to the older arrangements that they replace. I think those are very important things for the House to remember.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the agreements because, firstly, bigger markets mean more and better jobs. Secondly, we support them because we want to deepen our relationship with Indonesiaâour closest neighbour, a massive country, with massive economic potential, which is set to move from the 16th-biggest economy now to the fourth-biggest in 2050, with about US$1 trillion in GDP, growing at a rate of over five per cent, with 135 million people in the consumer class, the largest growth in customers outside of China and Indiaâand the list goes on and on. The opportunities for us in the Indonesian market are absolutely extraordinary. The obvious conclusion is that we are not serious about engaging with Asia unless we are serious about engaging with Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not acceptable for Indonesiaâsuch a big country, so close to usâto represent only two per cent of Australia's trade. As the member for Grayndler, the Leader of the Opposition, pointed out in his contribution, no pair of contiguous countries in the G20 have lower trade volumes than us and Indonesia. That is clearly not acceptable. That is something that was recognised by the Rudd and Gillard governments, which started down this path of the Indonesian agreement. There have been missteps since then, but it is now on track and ready to be supported by this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason we support these agreements before us in the House is that we did recognise that there were some shortcomings and we've gone to the government and negotiated some good improvements in the deals and the way that they've been struck. I think it's important to acknowledge and recognise that without some of the, frankly, robust engagement with stakeholders, including the labour movement, we wouldn't have had as well informed a view about what to push for when it came to negotiations with the trade minister, Simon Birmingham. He has come back and agreed to the proposals that we have put forward. I think that's a very good thing. There have been changes made when it comes to replacing the older, bilateral investment treaties: issues around the ISDS clauses, issues around labour market testing, issues around privatisationâall of these things that we have raised in good faith have been addressed by the response from the trade minister, and I wanted to acknowledge that. But I also wanted to acknowledge the many conversations that we have had with the labour movement and with other important groups around Australia to make sure that we have come to the best possible decision that we could when it came to these bills before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth reason why it's important that the House support these billsâI alluded to this at the very beginningâis that these are uncertain times and we do have weak economic growth in this country. When times are uncertain, when Australian economic growth is well below what we expect of it, we need more engagement with the world and with Asia, not less. We want to see more engagement, not less, with our neighbours and with the countries beyond, because in uncertain times, when we need the economy to grow faster, trade negotiations and agreements do give us the potential to address both of those shortcomings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to acknowledge, or at least to not let pass, some of the language of negative globalism from the Prime Minister in recent weeks. We had the member for Mackellar, I think, try to pretend that the IMF was some far-Left organisation. All of these sorts of things damage our ability to engage with the world. These bills are about engagement with the world, for good economic and strategic reasons. At the same time, we have these dangerous messages from the Prime Minister and down on that side of the House, which compromises our ability to deal with the world on good terms. When the Prime Minister gets up at the Lowy Institute speech, as he did in the last fortnight, and talks about negative globalism and runs down the global institutions which Australia has done so well from, recognising that it is in our national interest to have a voice and to have a say in the conduct of the world's affairsâto have a prime minister try and diminish that is troubling, I think. It's concerning. It's damaging. We need a prime minister who is not just chasing headlines; we need a prime minister who is chasing good outcomes for Australia. Good outcomes for Australia means engaging, seeking common ground, seeking common good, looking for ways to advance our national interest in the way that these bills do, frankly. He shouldn't be engaging with this far-Right, crazy language about global institutions. Global institutions do serve Australia well, and we should continue to engage with them, as we should continue to engage with the nations of our neighbourhood and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true, I think, that weakening global cooperation is now one of the big economic risks that we face as a country and as a region. It's true that Asia's growth and potential is making up a bigger proportion of the global economy. But it's also true that when cooperation falls down and the impact of that is felt disproportionately, Asiaâand Australia within Asiaâhas a great deal to lose across trade, investment, finance, immigration and regional cooperation. Growth in Asia is very interconnected. When cooperation fails or when countries put up walls, it is susceptible to a lot of damage when that path is followed. That clearly has implications for Australia and for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finishing up, I would summarise by saying that these deals may not be exactly as we would have struck them had we concluded these deals. We do not necessarily think every sentence in the deals is perfect. But, on balance, I think they are worth supporting. They are good for Australian workers. They are good for our relationship with Indonesia. We have been able to secure key improvements to the text of the agreements. In that light and for those reasons, I support these new agreements and I urge the House to do so as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  Selamat sore to those listening to this debate on the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and a related bill. When I was anak kecil I lived in Indonesia for three years. My father, Michael Leigh, was at Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, funded by the Australian government to work in a special training program designed to improve social science research capability throughout Indonesian universities and Islamic institutes. My mother, Barbara, was mostly looking after my brother, Tim, and me, but also began the research into the Indonesian education system that became her PhD thesis and wrote a book on traditional Acehnese textiles, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tangan-Tangan Trampil</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hands of Time</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Living in Aceh was a pretty extraordinary experience for an Australian boy to have. I attended the local school, where lessons were conducted in Indonesian and, where, in the face of a burgeoning Acehnese independence movement, we spent a large portion of the day singing nationalist songs to remind us all that we were Indonesian first and Acehnese second. The Suharto government was keen on that. We then played in the muddy playgroundâas the only white kid in the class, I was the only one whose white shirt had turned completely brown by the end of the day. My friend Niko Fahrizal and I would explore the local neighbourhood, playing by the river, watching the bigger kids at the volleyball nets, watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Scooby Doo</span> at Niko's place. Niko is now an officer in the Indonesian military. When my mother, Barbara, visits, he calls her tanteâauntieâBarbara.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were following the many Australians who engaged with Indonesia in the immediate decades after independence. They were an extraordinary group of people. Herb Feith, who created Australian Volunteers Abroad, believed that volunteering was 'symbolic of human equality'. I still remember Herb's enthusiasm for Indonesiaâthe way he would energetically share his ideas with everyone, from President Sukarno down to a little child like me. Herb's subsequent PhD thesis was dedicated to his friend Djaelani, a Jakarta servant who lived in one of the city's many slums. When I speak to young Australians looking to volunteer in South-East Asia, I encourage them to read Jemma Purdey's biography of Herb Feith before they go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those Indonesia experts didn't believe in just helping our large neighbour after independence. They also believed Australia had to get out our policies right. Jamie Mackie helped draft <span style="font-style:italic;">Control or Colour Bar?</span> and organised street protests against the White Australia policy. My father was among those who marched from Melbourne university, between tight rows of police officers, to campaign to scrap that policy. In the 1980s, thanks in part to the repeal of that policy, Chusnul Mariyah came to live with our family for several years while she wrote her PhD thesisâon the topic of Australian local government corruption, as it happens. My brother, Tim, and I still refer to Chusnul as our Indonesian big sister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arc that the Indonesian economy has taken over the past two generations is superbly traced out in a recent article by the Australian National University's Hal Hill. He noted that, while growth rates have moderated in the post-Suharto era, Indonesia has benefited from sound macroeconomic management, economic openness, inclusive social progress and institutional development. Indonesia still faces significant challenges; my own economics research with Pierre van der Eng on Indonesian inequality shows just one of those challenges. But, for all the challenges it faces, Professor Hillâs major conclusion is one of development success, broadly defined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, when it comes to Australia and Indonesia, we've too often neglected our relationship with what Hal Hill calls 'Asia's third giant'. Indonesia is a G20 nation with 10 times Australia's population and enormous diversity. It is the largest Muslim nation in the world. Indonesia and Australia have worked together in countless international forums to secure a more prosperous and peaceful region. But, between our two countries, we've got too little economic activity: just two per cent of Australia's exports go to Indonesia. There are too few interpersonal connections. We need a relationship based on more than batik, Bali and Bintang.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This free trade agreement with Indonesia has been a long time coming. Negotiations began under the Gillard government in 2010, restarted in 2016 and concluded in 2018. The signing process was then derailed for a time, when Prime Minister Morrison suggested that Australia might join Guatemala and the United States as the only two countries in the world placing their embassies in Israel in Jerusalem. We did eventually get there, and it's a good thing that we did. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bilateral agreement, a preferential trade agreement, and therefore not the best way of achieving trade liberalisation. Multilateral agreements are preferable; next after that, large plurilateral agreements; and then bilateral agreements. Businesses recognise this. According to the latest Australia's International Business Survey, just seven per cent of businesses identified such agreements as a key reason for choosing their first overseas market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strength of the relationship is certainly there on the Indonesian side. You only have to go through some of the stars of Indonesian politics who have spent substantial periods in Australia: Chatib Basri, known as Dede, Indonesia's former finance minister; Mari Pangestu, the former trade minister; former Vice-President Boediono; and Marty Natalegawa, the former foreign minister. The first cabinet of President Widodo included Pratikno, who is the Minister of State Secretariat, and Airlangga Hartarto, the Minister of Industry, both of whom had studied in Australia, at Flinders University, Monash University and Melbourne Business School.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Australian side, too few Australians have a deep understanding of Indonesia. When I was born in 1972 there were more Australian school students studying Bahasa Indonesia than there are today, despite the fact that Australia is much bigger than it was. That costs us in multiple ways. Language isn't just a communication tool; it is also a window into the culture. While I've forgotten much of the Bahasa I knew as a child, it is something I will use with my three little boys. When we're out at a restaurant and someone says their food is too hot, we'll have a conversation about whether they mean 'panas', meaning scalding, or 'pedas', meaning spicy. Sometimes English lacks the right adjective, and Indonesian can step in to fill the void.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Santo Darmosumarto, director of the East Asia and Pacific division of Indonesia's foreign ministry, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a long time we have looked north; to Japan, Korea and China, and so has Australia, but in both looking north we have missed each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Asialink report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Match fit: shaping Asia capable leaders</span>, found that at least eight out of 10 large Australian firms are inadequately equipped to do business in Asia. What is vital for Australia is to plug into those services supply chains in Asia where there are significant benefits of this free trade agreement on the goods side. Australian farmers will be able to export half a million tonnes of grain a year into Indonesia tariff-free, which especially matters given that Indonesia is Australia's largest wheat export market. The tariff on cattle will be eliminated. The tariff on steel will be reduced from 15 per cent to zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real long-term importance will be in assisting Australia's businesses to plug into the services supply chains in Asia. Australia's vocational education and training providers will be able to establish ventures in Indonesia with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. That's vital, given that Indonesia's industrial sector will need around 600,000 new skilled workers every year. Australian VET providers will be able to step up to the provision of high-quality in-country programs, including train-the-trainer teaching models and models that combine online education and in-person education. If it's to achieve the population-to-care ratios recommended by the World Health Organization, Indonesia needs to train around a million new nurses over coming years. Australian education and healthcare providers could work with Indonesia on that important services export. There are important opportunities in allied health care, social services companies and professional services firms in areas like waste, water and infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Indonesia is targeting 23 per cent renewable energy by 2025, up from just 12 per cent currently. Indonesia is working on ensuring greater reliability while moving towards cleaner power supply to reduce both carbon pollution and the direct impacts of poor air quality. In this vein, an ANU Grand Challenges project funded last year, Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific, is going to be an important piece of Australia's energy engagement with Indonesia. Among the academics involved in that project are Ken Baldwin and Emma Aisbett, as the joint leads; Chief Operating Officer Karen Warnes; Dr Matthew Stocks; Dr Fiona Beck; Associate Professor Paul Burke; Dr John Pye; and Associate Professor Janet Hunt. They are working on proposals, such as exploring why Indonesia needs climate finance for its energy transition and new opportunities to grow Indonesia's solar sector. The engagement with Indonesia on the services trade front will only grow in coming years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting this trade agreement, I am following in a long and distinguished line of Labor members of parliament who have argued the case for Labor as the party of trade liberalisation. Open markets are simply an extension of comparative advantage. Just as most of us don't fix our own cars, cut our own hair or make our own clothes, so too it makes sense for Australia to specialise in what we do best. As a country that constitutes just 0.3 per cent of the world's population, it naturally makes sense for us to focus on our comparative advantages. And in so doing we don't get beaten by the rest of the world. Trade isn't a zero-sum game, like the Olympics or the Eurovision Song Contest. Trade is an opportunity for us to get the gains from comparative advantage and from specialisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the Labor legacy this was first and most strongly recognised by the Whitlam government, with its 25 per cent tariff cut in 1973. It was then recognised by the Hawke and Keating governments, which significantly reduced Australia's tariff levels. Those tariff cuts, brought about through the 1980s and 1990s, delivered almost $4,000 a year into the pockets of the typical Australian household. This meant, in practical terms, that high tariffs, which had been over 100 per cent in the 1970s and which were still around 40 per cent in the early 1990s, were brought down on products such as cars, clothing and shoes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I wrote a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Choosing Openness</span>, I calculated the cost of a pair of children's shoes in 1987 and again in 2017. I found that children's running shoes had gone from $10 in 1987 to $9 in 2017 and that men's workboots went from $28 to $34. Given that wages had tripled over that period, that meant the amount of time that a typical worker needed to work to buy a pair of children's shoes had gone from 44 minutes to 13 minutes. And when I looked at cars, I found that the price of a base model Corolla had gone from $12,000 to $20,000 over that 30-year period. That meant that the amount of work required to buy a Corolla had fallen from six months work to three months work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those changes were progressive; the cuts in tariffs delivered more in proportional terms to low-income households than to high-income households. That's why, when Australians were asked by the Lowy Institute poll this year whether they believed that free trade is good or bad for their own standard of living, 75 per cent said it was good. It is why there is such a risk to Australia if we follow down the road that too many countries are on towards narrow, tribal nationalism. Labor's commitment to free trade has not been an ideological one; it has been a practical commitment, recognising that the benefits of trade flow most strongly to the most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the shadow minister for trade for the vital work that she has done in ensuring that this agreement backs Australian jobs and that significant concessions were achieved from the government to ensure that this agreement, like past free trade agreements that Australia has supported, is in the interests of the Australian economy, Australian households and Australian jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Labor supports the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the related bill to enable the government to enter into the free trade agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru. We've heard from many previous speakers that if Labor were in government of course we would have negotiated agreements with these countries that were somewhat different. But, nonetheless, we have tried, valiantly, to work through the processes available to us to try and ensure that a number of Labor principles on free trade are reflected in the agreements going forward and in future negotiations for free trade agreements. Part of that has been obviously the work done by the shadow minister and the minister for trade as well as by the Leader of the Opposition in negotiations with the government to try and reflect some of these important principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of it of course has been the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I'm deputy chair. As Deputy Speaker Karen Andrews would know, the important although understated work that committees do in this place is very, very important in making sure that some of our legislation is better than it is in the initial stages of drafting. It is a part of the important process to improve legislation in the national interest. The committee work is actually vitally important. I had that unique perspective of working on the JSCOT, as it's called, in the last couple of months on these free trade agreements. Obviously, the public hearings and the submissions that were put to the committee by a whole range of stakeholders and organisations were very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I want to acknowledge the chair of the JSCOT, the member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, for his work and also the secretariat, who did a lot of great work in the last couple of months, in what was a very tight time frame around these free trade agreements given the government's timetable and schedule in wanting to ratify at a certain point in time. The Labor members on the JSCOT, from our perspective, worked very hard to try and ensure that some of those principles were reflected in the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 186</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Starting really with one of the main issues that has exercised not just the Labor Party but the labour movement more generally is the issue around labour market testing. The wording in this report reflects the importance of ensuring that any agreement that Australia enters into with Indonesia in the future is made at a treaty levelânot a subtreaty levelâand that it does not waive labour market testing with respect to contractual service suppliers. I note the Leader of the Opposition's announcement earlier todayâthat he had negotiated this with the governmentâwas welcome news. That's very, very important because what it does is give preference to Australian jobs. It makes sure the skills testing and the labour market testing are there to make sure that any temporary foreign workers meet the same standards as Australian workers. That is of critical importance for Australians and for Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important recommendation I highlight out of the report is recommendation 4, in which the Australian government would pursue the termination of the survival clause in the old bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Indonesia, which effectively means terminating the old ISDS provisions that existed under that agreement signed back in 1992 obviously in favour of far more improved and better ISDS provisions in the current agreement that's been signed. This really goes to reducing Australia's potential exposure to claims under the superseded agreement and is very much in line with ensuring that there are safeguards, carve-outs around public policy that will make a huge difference to investors going into Indonesia and also into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted, too, the achievement of this agreement with one of our largest and closest neighbours is of utmost importance, in my view, given this time of global trade uncertainty. It is important to note, too, that the Labor Party has always been a party of trade on fair terms. We're hopeful that the agreement will lead to a greater number of exports and a closer trading relationship with what is such an important neighbour in Indonesia and an economy that is growing at such a rapid pace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important recommendation to note in the report is the recommendation that the Australian government give due consideration to implementing independent economic modelling around these agreements, particularly with respect to having that occur through the Productivity Commission, or an equivalent organisation, and providing that to the JSCOT in future, alongside what is given to the committee with respect to these agreements, and that is the national interest analysis. That is something that has been called for over many parliaments, with respect to ensuring that the trade deals we enter into actually work for Australians, with some evidence based independent economic modelling that can give us some certainty around the benefits and the opportunities that flow out of these agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the point that was raised this morning about the importance of consultation with civil society, particularly the union movement, a number of submissions that came to our committee made the argument that much of civil society, and the union movement in particular, felt that they were shut out of the negotiations with DFAT officials during the course of the preparation of the agreement and the negotiations around elements of the agreement. They made the argument that many other stakeholders, such as business, were given much more time in that process. We had some language in the report that went to resolving that there be further consideration around consultation mechanisms in the context of trade treaties during this 46th Parliament. This actually means much more than that. It means having the committee look at the whole treaty-making process in the 46th Parliamentâhow we can improve it in order to ensure that we get better results. Part of that is the inclusion of civil society stakeholders, such as the union movement, within the consultation process, just like any other stakeholder. That's been an important element in the committee's work over the last couple of months. It's important that we are able to conduct hearings on this in the 46th Parliament in order to see how we can improve those processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a point about the Hong Kong free-trade agreement. We had much discussion and debate about the language on the unique status of Hong Kong that goes into this report. We have signed an agreement with an autonomous entity within what everyone knows is the one country, two systems framework. I note the arguments made by the chair of the JSCOT, the member for Wentworth, and the government's broader argument that the characteristics that make Hong Kong unique under this system are being recognised by the very active signing of a separate agreement with the territory. These, obviously, are the rule of law, freedom of expression and some of the democratic rights that are afforded or have been afforded to residents of Hong Kong under the basic law. There is certainly a strong argument that if we are signing this type of agreement with Hong Kong we are further emphasising and supporting the unique autonomous status that exists. I have made the point thoughâand I've made this publicâthat if the ongoing civil disturbance and political instability in Hong Kong leads to a diminution of those rights, those very unique elements that make Hong Kong the special autonomous territory that it is, then real consideration should be given by government to the ratification timeline, because the very act of ratifying the agreement may, in those circumstances, actually lead to the diminution of those rights. That's why it's so important that the government and the opposition, through the committee as well, have noted the importance of continuing to monitor the situation on the ground in Hong Kong with respect to those unique elements of the autonomous territory, in order to ensure that that can be resolved as peacefully as possible. That is a slight difference in positioning, I guess, between myself and the member for Wentworth, but I think it's important to note that for the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to Indonesia, we've heard many speakers raise what I think are extremely important points. One is the fact that the Indonesian economy is on track to being the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050, with a consumer class of around 135 million people by 2030âproviding a great opportunity for Australia's exports into that country. We've heard time and time again that this trading relationship with one of our closest neighbours, our northern neighbour, right on our doorstep, has been woefully underdone. Currently, Indonesia accounts for only around two per cent of our exports. That is a remarkable statistic given the size of the country that's just to our north. It's currently our 14th-largest trading partnerâagain, a remarkable statistic given the fact that there are over 240 million Indonesians just to our north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many respects, this agreement fits into the broader objective that I think we should all share, and that is to improve our relationship with Indonesia. It's certainly a bipartisan objective in the general sense. It has been a relationship which I think has been woefully underdone. Many Australian businesses have kind of leapfrogged Indonesia to go to other parts of Asia. There are different reasons for that. At the public hearings and in submissions there were points raised about how difficult it is to do business in Indonesiaâand there were valid reasons given for that. We realised that we had to do much better in enhancing our relationship with Indonesia in order to give Australian businesses and Indonesian businesses a better opportunity for the economic relationship to flourish. This is one step towards that and one that we should all support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point to make is that Australia needs to look at diversifying its tradeânot have a trading relationship that is limited or narrowly focused on one or two countries but really trying to diversify our economic and commercial trading relationships right across the Asia-Pacific. This free trade agreement with Indonesia is also a step in that diversification objective. This agreement will allow our relationship with Indonesia, an important regional partner, to grow. I support the agreement on that basis, as much as for any of the other reasons that have been enunciated today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've mentioned, the Australian Labor Party believes that our trade agreement processes should be more open and consultative. This is a really important point. I welcome some of the improvements that have been agreed to with respect to the process and, as deputy chair of the JSCOT, I look forward to working on these. The JSCOT is one of the few avenues that allow business, civil society, the union movement, other stakeholders and ordinary peopleâcitizensâto provide input and feedback on Australia's treaty-making process. Reviewing and improving this process is of utmost importance, and I welcome the step that we're taking.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  The bills before us, the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, give effect to the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the free trade agreement between Australia, Hong Kong and China, and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. There are three agreements but, in the contribution that I will make to this debate, I want to focus my comments on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. I want to express my strong support for the agreement and to set out the reasons why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first came to this parliament I was concerned that I personally and Australians in general lacked a deep knowledge and understanding of Indonesiaâour nearest neighbour and a significant partner in the region. I set out on my own personal journey to try to close that gap not only by learning the Indonesian language and by working on person-to-person ties but also by looking for opportunities, in my role as a parliamentarian, to establish links and relationships with parliamentarians from Indonesia. My job has been imperfect, but I think standing here and strongly advocating for this agreement is another step in the right direction. Indonesia, as has been said by others in this debate, is Australia's largest near-neighbour. It's the seventh-largest economy in the world and has a population of more than 260 million people. Almost by dint of that populationâbut also because of some proactive decisions being made by the Indonesian governmentâit will move from the 11th largest economy in the world to the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Paul Keating set out when he was Prime Minister, the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is absolutely critical to both of our nations' futures. Defence ties are very, very good. There is regular contact, regular exchange, regular cooperation between the Australian and the Indonesian defence forces, as there is with the other security agencies of both of our countries. From time to time there are bumps in the political relationship, but overall I would rate it as very, very good indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the areas where we are significantly underdone is in our people-to-people relationship and in our economic relationship. In terms of our bilateral trade relations, our relationship with Indonesia sits at No. 13 in the ranking of trading partners, at around $16.8 billion. If you drill down into that, you can see where the gaps really are. The level of mutual direct foreign investment between the two countries sits just under $22 billion, which sounds like a lot of money but, when you look at the direct foreign investment that we have with other near-neighbours, whether that be New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia or Singapore, we're way off the pace when you look at the importance and the size of our respective economies. We have more bilateral trade with New Zealand, a country of 4.8 million people, and Singapore, a country of 5.6 million people, than we do with the seventh-largest economy in the world. I'm not being critical of the fact that we have excellent trading relationships with these countries. They are important. But I am criticalâand I think we have a collective responsibility of doing something about thisâof the fact that for far too long Australians and Australian businesses have flown over Jakarta to do business in Singapore and in Hong Kong and to do business more latterly in Shanghai and southern China. We have been flying over the opportunities to do business and to strengthen those person-to-person and business-to-business relationships with Indonesia. The direct effect of trade agreements can be overdone, but I think it is true to say that they are a part of a number of steps that governments can take to improve those relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about comparisons of our trade relationships, we export more goods and services at the moment to the United Kingdom. If you stand on the tip of Cape Yorkâavoid the crocodiles!âand I've done this, you can almost, on a good day, see the territories of Indonesia, which are less than 200 kilometres away, yet we export more goods and services to the United Kingdom, which is more than 15,000 kilometres away, than we do to our largest near-neighbour. Much more can and should be done. There are opportunities, and this partnership agreement spells out a pathway to developing those opportunities. Indonesia, for its part, has an ambitious infrastructure investment agenda which will drive demand for steel and other Australian exports, including the construction of an entirely new capital for their country. What an exciting opportunity it is for the Indonesians on the island of Borneo in the province of East Kalimantan to be building a new capital from scratch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia's economy is growing at more than five per cent per year. Indonesia imports, at the moment, enormous quantities of wheat, sugar and cotton from Australia, and we'd like the opportunity to be able to expand the exportation in these product lines, but we can do more as well. It's interesting to note that Indonesia imports nearly $3 billion worth of wheat every year but only one-third of that wheat comes from one of the biggest wheat producers in the world, and that is Australia. So much of that is grown in Western Australia, which is so very, very close to the markets of Java and beyond. Demand in Indonesia for Australian services is strong and could be strongerâservices such as education, health care and tourism; of course, there wouldn't be many Australians of my age who haven't been to Bali several timesâbut we need to extend it beyond that. Our engineering services sector is just one area of services where we could be expanding our trade opportunities. It's already one of the largest markets for our significant mining technology equipment as well. Again, more can be done in that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about trade agreements at large. It has been the instinctive response of many within the Centre Left of politics in this country to have an opposition to free trade agreements. I understand fully the history to that: protection of jobs in industries that have grown up around tariff protection; provision of good jobs, good incomes, and good security for the workers and their families. That cannot be dismissed lightly. While the benefits of trade and free trade are distributed thinly but widely throughout the country, the impact of reducing tariff protection is felt very deeply and is concentrated in those communities which have been home to manufacturing and manufacturing production. So I do understand the concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the majority of the work, if you likeâthe majority of reformâoccurred in the 1990s. When your level of general tariff is at two per cent and you just consider the weekly and monthly fluctuation of the Australian dollar, you've virtually got no tariff barrier at two per cent. Any trade agreement that Australia has will have much more to do with facilitating access to a market with greater trade barriers than Australia has. We're not giving up very much at all, because we're virtually at zero tariffs at the moment. In just about any trade agreement that Australia has at the moment, there is almost more to be gained than there is to be lost. There are some exceptions to that. Before people grab their keyboards and start sending emails, yes, of course there are exceptions to that, but the point remains: when your general tariff is at two per cent and a lot of the other trading partners have tariffs in the eight, nine and 10 per cent ranges, any market access that you can get that enables them to reduce their background tariffs is an advantage to Australiansâto Australian producers and to workers in the businesses that are exporting to Indonesia. That is particularly the case for businesses within my electorate. I argue that this is good for the economy and good for the country as a whole. It is strategically important, but it's actually economically important for the people that I represent. I want to pick a few sectors. One of Australia's most significant steel manufacturers, BlueScope, is centred in Port Kembla and employs approximately 3Â½ thousand direct employees and an additional 4Â½ thousand to 5,000 employees indirectly. Most of them live in either my electorate or the electorate of the member for Cunningham. It's incredibly important. They represent approximately 10 per cent of all jobs throughout the Illawarra region and 11 per cent of gross regional product. Twenty-four per cent of the region's total output comes through those factory gates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this basis, exporting around 700,000 tonnes of steel every year is incredibly important for the Port Kembla steelworks, because when you're making steel, particularly from the blast furnace method, it's all about volume. You've got to pump as much steel through that blast furnace and through the slab caster as you can every dayâproducing the slabs, rolling it into hot rolled coil and getting it out of the gates to the markets of Australia and the world. More markets mean more throughput, which means you can improve the profitability of that plant and the returns to the profitability of the plant, securing the jobs of the workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">BlueScope also has a fabricating and a processing plant in Indonesia. Hopefully, it will benefit from the massive infrastructure build that's underway there. This agreement will improve the ability of BlueScope to export hot rolled and cold rolled coil into Indonesia. It will be a significant boost to that factory and to the workers within that factory. So it is in the interests of steelworkers and those who represent them in the Illawarra. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just Port Kembla, although, as a town that's built around a portâas is the electorateâour livelihoods are built on the back of selling things to other countries and bringing things in and out of that port. We get the importance of trade. The agreement is also important in the area of education services. When I was growing up, the steelworks was the most important institution. I think it now shares that prize with the University of Wollongong. It's a world-class university, one of the best in Australia for its teaching quality, and it will substantially benefit from this agreementâbecause one of the areas where, again, we're underdone economically, is in direct student exchange and in the university area. So there is great potential there as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got about a minute and a half left in this debate and I wanted to say one final thing on this. When Paul Keating said that we needed to do more as a nation to strengthen our relationship with Indonesia, one of the things he said was that it's got to start in the classroom. We've got to have students learning the Indonesian language and learning about Indonesian culture. It is a matter of great shame that there were more students learning Indonesian in the 1990s than there are today. If you look at the percentages for all year 12 students who are enrolled in a tertiary recognised language in Australia, there are 20 per cent doing Japanese, another 21 per cent doing French, seven per cent doing German, 19 per cent doing Chinese and nine per cent doing Italian. Do you know what percentage are doing Indonesian? Four per cent. Four per cent. We've actually gone backwards. So, if we're going to do something about the business relationships and something about the people-to-people-relationships, we need more people studying the language of Indonesia, Bahasa Indonesia, and it has to start in the classroom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  These agreements give more rights to big corporations than to governments and to workers, and they should be opposed. These agreements are being negotiated by big corporations and their shills in the Liberal government, and it is appalling that now, when this wasn't even on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for today, Labor and the Liberals have done a dirty deal to rush this legislation through the parliament, over the very strong and legitimate objections of working people and non-government organisations right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These deals are not simply about trade. If they were simply about trade, they'd probably be unobjectionable. And there's nothing wrong with having an agreement with Indonesia or Peru or Hong Kongâalthough I'll come back to Hong Kong in a momentâor any other country in principle. It's not about saying you can't strike a deal. The question is: what's in it? The question is: is the government, at the behest of big corporations, signing away rights that most people in Australia think are part and parcel of a democracy? When you look at this deal, the answer is yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no answer for Labor to come in here and say, 'We just negotiated a side deal with the government.' This is the very same government they've told us in the last few weeks we can't trust because they're loose with the truth. Now apparently we have to just accept that it's all going to be okay because there is a side letter from the minister that promises to fix the problems. Well, no. What this dodgy side letter from the minister boils down to is that all the existing loopholes will continue to apply. The big win that has been negotiated out of this is that the existing loopholes won't be expanded. Well, whoop-de-doo. At the moment, the problem is that there are holes in these agreements that are big enough to fly plane loads of exploited overseas workers through. That is bad for the overseas workers because they end up here being exploited, working with the threat of expulsion from the country always over their head, and that allows them to be put through conditions most of us would find objectionable. It's also bad because it means local wages and conditions get pushed down. That is why unions who have looked at this deal have said, 'Hang on, there's something wrong here.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the way these agreements are negotiated is that you don't get to see the text before it's put on the table and you have to either take it or leave it. The problem with these agreements is that even when the text is put on the table there's no independent analysis done. Alarm bells should be ringing for the government when the Productivity Commission and the Greens start agreeing about the need for cost-benefit analysis, but that is where we are at with these agreements because the government's come in here with all sorts of promises about how great these agreements are and the Productivity Commission is the first in line to stand up and say, 'Well, actually, if that's right, then test it.' Do some analysis and test it. Put forward a case to parliament before each of us is asked to vote on it, as Labor and Liberal are asking us to do in this rush deal here today. Put up some economic analysis that shows that there might be some benefitâbut there's none.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this with the ChAFTA agreement, when the minister at the time told us: 'It's all right. It's all going to be fine because there will be hundreds of jobsâ600 or 700 jobs in the dairy industry in the first year alone.' That's what the minister said about ChAFTA. Well, no. Jobs in that industry have gone backwards. Even the spurious claims they make about previous agreements show you can't believe the spin. That's why they're not prepared to front up here with some kind of independent analysis about how great these deals are meant to be. The fact that they can't come in here with any analysis tells you everything you need to know. If you don't believe the Greens, listen to the Productivity Commission about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals come in here and say: 'We've got this great deal that we've negotiated on behalf of our corporate masters, and I'm sorry it is going to mean a few diminutions of your labour standards, workers; you'll just have to cop that. Sorry there are no enforceable labour chapters or environment chapters in this; you're just going to have to cop that.' You expect that from the Liberals. I say to Labor: stop caving in to the government. Let's stand up to this government and the dodgy deals that it does. The sooner we do that, and the sooner an alternative is presented, the sooner they'll be out of office. At the moment they've only got a one-seat majority in this place. Who knows what's going to happen and how many by-elections there will be; there are always by-elections during the course of a parliament. We could have this government out soon. But if you keep agreeing with them and giving them everything they want, then they'll just get emboldened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go to some of the specifics about this, there's the local advertising of jobs. One would think it's an unobjectionable principle to say that where there are jobs going here in Australia, we will advertise locally first. If we can't find someone locally then of course we can look overseas, because there's nothing in principle wrong with saying there might be skills gaps in Australia or that we want to have greater international cooperation, so we'll have a system that says people can come from other countries and work here. But the question is: what is in the agreement? You would think there would be something that says that you have to advertise locally first, but we know there's not, because we know there are whole carve-outs in this that say there can be new categories of people who don't have to go through that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the text with respect to other labour matters, there are some real questions about qualifications and standards. For example, most people would think, if you have Australian rules and restrictions around someone who is an electrician, that anyone who is going to work in this country has been through an actual testing process to know they can comply with those standards. What happens under these agreements, though, is that someone from another countryâa sponsor; a big corporationâputs in application and says, 'It's okay; I vouch that so-and-so has the appropriate standards.' Do they have to go through a separate testing process? No. Does it have to be checked? Do they get assessed that they know how Australian electrical standards work? No. Someone sitting behind a desk does a paper check and, bang, they can come through.</span>

                    </a>  We have heard interjections that this is rubbish. Obviously no-one has sat down and actually looked at some of the cases of systematic exploitation that have been unearthed by the use of contractual service suppliers or people on section 400 agreements. We see, time and again, people being put in the most exploitative conditions to build our buildings, service our industries and do work under these agreements, because, once someone comes here, they are under the thumb of the employer who says, 'If you don't accept these lower wages and conditions, I'll revoke your permission on the visa and you are on the next plane back.' That is what allows for exploitation, which has been uncovered time and again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have clauses in here that allow corporations to sue governments if those governments dare to do something in the interests of their own people which somehow impinges on the profitability of those corporations. Peru is one of the countries being talked about. A company took Peru to courtâit is not even a court; they are these secret tribunals where you don't have to have judicial qualifications. It is why the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia has said, 'Hey, watch out; Australia is trading away its judicial sovereignty to these secret tribunals as part of these so-called ISDS clauses.' You allow two or three people sitting in a room, a secret panel, to decide whether or not a corporation can sue the Australian government. When I say 'sue', it's not just for money; they can actually require that we change the laws. Peru got sued through one of these tribunals, because it deigned to pass laws that benefited its Indigenous population. A French company sued the Egyptian government because that government passed laws with respect to lifting the minimum wage. That is why people do not like these.</span>

We know there is a problem, because the Labor Party have identified that there is a problem, but they've wriggled out of it and said, 'It's okay; we'll sign up to the one the Liberals have negotiated.' As I read the agreements, to give an example of this, previously governments have been taken to court when they tried to restrict tobacco by plain-packaging laws. In the Hong Kong agreement, as I understand it, there is mention of tobacco; in the Peru agreement there is mention of tobaccoâbut not in the Indonesian agreement. Why is there no mention of tobacco in the Indonesian agreement? I'd be happily told that I'm wrong. Why are there specific mentions in the other agreements and not the Indonesian one? Is it just coincidence that that happens to be a country where the tobacco industry has a significant stake? Are we opening the door to more litigation against Australia on the tobacco front? You can sure as hell bet we are on the aged-care front and in a bunch of other service industries. Where we in this parliament think we are democratically elected to pass laws, we will find we no longer have the capacity to legislate, because someone will come along and say, 'Hang on, you can't pass that, because that might affect the profitability of corporation X over here; we're going to wind it back.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation in Hong Kong is especially concerning if you are concerned about democracy. What we have seen recently in Hong Kong is continued brutal repression of democracy activists and leaders. One of the things that those democracy leaders have asked us is to defer any agreements that apply to Hong Kong until the situation there is resolved. We have had members of the Liberal Party, of the government in this place, get themselves photographed with the Hong Kong demonstrators to say, 'Yes, we stand with you in support of democracy.' Well, those very same activists are saying, 'Please do not give legitimacy to the other side by proceeding with a deal at a very time when we are being attacked and our lives are under threat.' That is a very sensible call that no-one should be able to refuse. So when we come to the consideration in detail stage we will be moving an amendment to delay, should, as I expect, Labor go over and sit with the government to support something their corporate masters have negotiated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the bills are going to go ahead, then, at the least, we should do three things. First, we should not proceed with the agreement with Hong Kong until the situation there is resolved; we are proposing at least a year's breathing space. Second, we should not allow this legislation that is being debated here to give corporations the right to sue our government and get us to change our laws just because our government does something that is for the benefit of the Australian people. We have the capacity to pass amendments to say, 'No, these deals don't come into effect until you go back and negotiate something better.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, we are presented with a 'take it or leave it', which means we can't get into the specifics of any individual agreement and take this bit out or that bit out. In that context, that's why we are going to oppose them. But if the parliament is going to approve them, then enough of this, 'Oh, we'll do something different if we are in government' from the opposition. No; we've got the capacity to put changes through now and to say to the government: 'If you are so desperate to pass this deal, go back and negotiate something that the parliament wants. If this deal has to be done, if it's really that desperate, go back and negotiate something that takes out those provisions that allow corporations to sue government and to get us to change our laws. Also, go and do something else.' Again, we don't need to have, 'If only we'd had a change of government at the election'; we can fix this here and now. We can say, 'Go back and renegotiate the agreements to make it explicit that you advertise locally first.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those people who are loudly yapping away from the government backbenches, who have never even read the text of the agreement, saying, 'It's okay, it's all rubbish; you can be assured of our protections': if we can be assured of the protections, then you won't have any problem with supporting an amendment that says that we are going to renegotiate some side deals that make it crystal clear that you will advertise locally first. What would be the objection to that?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise in support of Labor's amendment and to make a contribution to the debate this evening on the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the conjoined bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019. Importantly, these bills give effect to the government's proposed trade agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru. In principle, Labor supports free trade. Indeed, we have a long history of doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a cautionary tale of how important free trade is, you need only look at the chaos and upheaval we've seen in recent months as a result of the current US-China trade wars. Reducing trade barriers opens up new markets, creates more competitive industries and delivers lower prices and greater choice for Australian consumers, but this should never come at the expense of protecting local jobs and the working conditions of Australian men and womenâworking conditions that have been hard-fought for and long secured in this nation by the collective actions of our union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we first saw what was being proposed by the government, Labor had a number of serious concerns. Firstly, we were profoundly worried that there was the potential for labour market testing to be waived for contract service suppliers in the future. Labour market testing is an absolutely fundamental protection for local workers. It ensures that, wherever possible, Australian jobs go to Australians. Of course, we have always understood that, where there are genuine skill shortages and a genuine incapacity to fill those positions with Australian workers, then opportunities and pathways are opened up to suitably trained and qualified people migrating to Australia or visiting on relevant visas to undertake that work. That has never been an issue. The point for Australian Labor members has been whether or not genuine market testing has been taking place in this country beforehand. We have seen numerous examples of where that process has not been treated with the due respect that it should be given, by corporations and local businesses in Australia. As I said, labour market testing remains a fundamental protection for local workers and one that the Australian Labor Party is especially focused on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we were also worried that, unless the existing bilateral treaty with Indonesia was terminated, we would be left with the current antiquated ISDS provisionsâand that those antiquated provisions would have remained in force. And that was not in anyone's interest. Those outdated investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms are a direct attack on our national sovereignty. They provide a framework for multinational corporations to sue countries for implementing legislation that affects their profits. Let's not forget the attack that Philip Morris made on the Australian government for having the audacity to put the health of our citizens at the top of our priorities and to push for what were world-leading, ground-breaking laws at the time, that demanded the plain packaging of tobacco products in Australia. So there are very good reasons for Australia to be concerned about outdated ISDS mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it must be said that, if Labor were in government, these are not the agreements that we would have negotiated, but this is the reality that we are dealing with. We have two bills before usâand, as I said, Labor has already raised a number of concerns, many of which the government has made agreements on, and I will come back to those matters in a moment. But it is clearly unconscionable for us to have those outdated ISDS mechanisms remain in situ, in any agreement, because of the implications they have for our national sovereignty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wanted to ensure that the new trade agreement with Indonesia would include modern safeguards, as well as a review of these new ISDS operations after a five-year period. In order to address these matters, Labor's shadow minister for trade, the member for Brand, Madeleine King, wrote to the trade minister, outlining Labor's concerns. These include the issues I've just outlined, as well as protections for working holiday-makers and confirmation that nothing in the agreements would require the privatisation of government services, among other things. I'm very pleased that the government has agreed to all of these requests and I would like to congratulate the shadow minister for standing strong and achieving such a great outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the government has also agreed to an inquiry into the treaty-making process, to look at how we can improve transparency and increase consultation for further agreements. This is a critical issue for the Australian people. We need to lift the veil of secrecy on trade arrangements being made behind closed doors so that there is confidence always in the processes of government. Anything we can do to improve transparency and increase consultation for further trade agreements is absolutely worth prosecuting, and I'm glad that the government has agreed to at least having an inquiry into the mechanisms and pathways that we could take in order for this to improve, as I said, the transparency and the consultation process of future trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the trade minister for working collaboratively with Labor to achieve a better outcome and a better deal, importantly, for Australian workers. That being said, there are still fundamental issues that we have with the way in which these agreements are negotiated. Given the far-reaching impacts that they have across our economy and, indeed, our workforce, the impacts of a bad deal are very dire indeed. I have met with many of my workers in Newcastle and their representative unions over the last few weeks and months and, more recently, last Friday back in Newcastle. They've expressed serious concerns because there is a lack of trust in whether the government is going to put the working rights and conditions of Australian men and women at the forefront of their thoughts. There is a long history to suggest that the rights of working men and women in Australia haven't always been front and centre of conservative governments' minds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said that, for a lot of Australians, their experience of a free trade agreement hasn't always been positive. I think we need to recognise that. We know that the benefits of these agreements have not been equally distributed throughout the community. There needs to be careful attention paid by the government, irrespective of who's in power, as to how you remedy those kinds of inequities that can occur as a result of free trade agreements. To this end, it is very disappointing that the government continues to reject Labor's request for mandatory independent economic modelling be done for these and future trade agreements because, without this modelling, how can we possibly know whether these deals are good for our country and our communities? There is little data, certainly little independent economic data, which we can turn to that would give greater confidence to Australian working men and women and their families that these agreements will, in fact, deliver some benefit to them and to their neighbouring communities. Labor will continue to prosecute the case for better transparency, for greater analysis and oversight of all trade agreements to make sure that they are always in Australia's best interests and in the interests of business, workers and consumers alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to end with a very serious issue that was raised with me by the ETU in Newcastle last Friday with regards to the increased prevalence of unlicensed electricians working on projects across multiple jurisdictions, across all states and territories in Australia. This is not an issue that is directly relevant to the free trade agreements before us, except to say that there is a significant level of anxiety about the apparent incapacity for state and territory governments to enforce existing state and territory laws that would ensure that all workers, whether they be Australian workers, migrant workers or holiday-makers, are suitably trained and qualified to conduct work in Australia according to Australian standards and laws. As I said, this is an especially critical issue for electrical workers in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is certainly an issue that Labor will continue to prosecute, because Australians have every right to expect that the people wiring our schools, our homes and our businesses, for example, would be fully trained and qualified electricians according to Australian standards. If that is not the case, it is a shameful state of affairs. But, let's be clear: that is not the result of free trade agreements; it is the result of the current incapacity of state and territory governments to enforce the existing laws that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should all be shouting very loudly at every opportunity to insist that these laws be enforced, that there areâto borrow an expression from the government that is often usedâan adequate number of 'cops on the beat' in our Australian workplaces to ensure that Australian standards are being complied with. It is all very well for government members to be 'outraged' by union activity on worksites, but why don't they insist on inspecting the quality of work being done onsite to ensure that workers have been adequately trained and supported on site and that there is no lessening of standards at any point, especially critical industries like electrical trades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always stand up for the rights of Australian working men and women. We will continue to hold the government to account for the concessions that the government has given on these free trade agreements. I note that the member for Brand, the shadow minister, has been in the chamber throughout this debate, and I welcome her presence and her earlier contribution. As I said before, Labor is absolutely adamant that Australian workers receive the due respect and protections that they deserve; that we should have a stronger focus on the labour-market testing laws in Australia and ensure that they are the most rigorous they can be; and that Australian men and women are always given the priority they deserve in the workforce.</span>
                </p>

It is going to go on the public record and I am going to send it to the Newcastle newspapers. She's saying that our jobs and working conditions will be protected. We are now directly competing against Indonesia, who is potentially the biggest coalmining country in the world. Our workers are going to be working and competing against them for wage structures, and she is saying, 'Oh, we're going to protect the wages.' How are you going to protect the wages? You just agreed to a free trade agreement. No wonder the unions are walking away from the ALP. No wonder there is now open warfare in my state. The government in Queensland wants the coal and sugarcane industries closed down. Well, we only have two industries in Queensland: the sugar industry and the coal industry.

I'll give you the hard reality. A person who used to walk around this placeâwho has since passed on, so I can't condemn himâsaid that we were going to be the food bowl of Asia. What we'll be is the begging bowl of Asia. I have the figures for fruit and vegetables. We import $2,403 million and we export $1,059 million. So much for being the food bowl of Asia! This country is importing twice as much fruit and vegetables as it exports. We import more pork than we export. We import more fish and fish products then we export. What the hell do we actually export positively? The first industry to be deregulated was the wool industry.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. I don't want to take up any more time. I want to move on. I'd take up as much time as possible, if I were them. They started off the first industry to be deregulated. The first industry to be deregulated was the wool industry. The wool industry was bigger than coal. It was $6,000 million, and coal is about $5,800 million. Keating comprehensively destroyed the wool industry by deregulation. Our forefathers foughtâand every time I leave this parliamentary chamber, you'll watch me hold up my fist in salute to the first member for Kennedy, the Labor member who held the seat for 25 years. He fought like a tiger to secure arbitrationâdecent pay and conditions for us. The farmers deserve decent pay and conditions as well. The Country Party, God bless them, got arbitration for the farmers. So every single farming industry, with the exception of cattle, had arbitration, for the sake of a better word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Keating, coming from the party that fathered arbitration in this place, came in here, and the first thing he did was deregulate the greatest source of income that this nation has had in its entire history. Every single year for over 100 years, the economy of Australia depended upon the wool industry, and he destroyed it. Within three years the wool industry was one-third the income it was before that man deregulated and destroyed it. He took on the farmers first, but, believe me, if he'd stayed around, he'd have taken on the workers too, because this man was driven by ideology. We have a saying in the bush: when your neighbour starts preaching religion, reach for your branding iron. I find it to be very true. When we talk about ideology, I start getting twitchy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've referred to the figures for woolâ62 per cent of the sheep herd has gone, never to return. It was destroyed by deregulation. I've referred to fruit and vegetablesâwe're importing more than twice as much fruit and vegetables into Australia as we are exporting. I have referred to the pork industry. I have referred to the fishing industry. But exactly what food products do we export positively? Cattle is the only thing left, andâheaven only knowsâthe Labor government did a fair job of destroying the cattle industry with their ban on live cattle exports. Cattle is down from 32 million to 23 million. Dairy production is down 19 per cent. Sugar is down from 5.4 million tonnes to 4.7 million tonnes. And sheep are down 62 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn to manufacturing. The motor vehicle industry has gone completely. The petrol industry has gone completelyâor near enough to completely. The whitegoods industry has gone almost completely. The textile, footwear and clothing industry has been decimated. This country is not a mining country. Everyone says, 'All we've got left is mining.' No, you don't have mining; you have quarrying. Mining is when you dig it out of the ground and sell a metal. We don't dig it out of the ground and sell a metal; we dig it out of the ground and sell the ground. That's called quarryingâthat's iron ore and coal. More than half of this nation's income now comes from two quarriesâthe iron ore and the coal quarry. There are a lot of people in this place who believe the coal industry should be closed down. That's a good idea! We'd have no income at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've still got a few to go. We gave the gas industry away. The brilliant leadership in this place sold all of our gas for 6c a unit. For those of you in the Labor Party, I got that by going to the convention of the ACTU. They had it up, covering the whole front of the dais. We sold the gas for 6c. Then, Labor governments were up to their eyeballs in it, and the ACTU is pulling no punches on it. We sold it for 6c. We now buy it back for $16. How can we stay internationally competitive in areas like fertiliserâI represent the biggest fertiliser plant in Australia, bringing in $2,000 million a year to the Australian economyâwhen we're paying $16 a unit for gas and our competitors are paying between $6 and $7 a unit for gas?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The steel industry has said, 'If you keep going with your present free-market electricity, there'll be no steel industry in Australia.' Half of it has already gone. There's been absolutely no effort made to stop the super-cheap steel coming in from China. Aluminium is concealed electricity, and since Australia has the highest electricity charges in the worldâthere's an advertisement on the television every night stating that, and, from the figures I've seen, that's most certainly correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to agriculture. I got vilified by the rural action council of Mareeba, maybe the best fighting group this nation has ever seen in the area of agriculture, because John Anderson, the leader of the National Party, of which I was a member at the time, had said, 'We don't need 240,000 farmers.' He was being criticised because people were exiting the industry all the time. He said: 'We don't need 240,000 farmers. We only need 120,000.' And I'll quote the boys at the rural action council up there in Far North Queenslandâin, I might add, the electorate of Ted Theodore, the greatest man that ever walked into this place, with the possible exception of Jack McEwen; Red Ted Theodore was Clyde Packer's closest personal friend, I might add, as well as the leader of the Labor Party in Australiaâwho said, 'If we don't need 240,000, what's he advocating? That we lose 120,000 farmers?' Well, we have! When he made that statement, we had 240,000 farmers. Now we've got 120,000. And it's thanks to his free trade policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have listened to a member from Newcastle talking about making sure our wages are protected. We are going one-on-one against the biggest, or soon-to-be the biggest, coal producing nation on earth, Indonesiaâwe are going one-on-one against it. And we're going to pay the same wages, are we? We were enjoying $200,000 a year for our miners. Heaven only knows, they're in industries that are extremely dangerous. They work in extremely adverse conditions. And, thanks to the weak-kneed Labor governments of Queensland and Western Australia that allowed fly-ins, they don't see their families and they've got to live away from home for most of their lives, thanks to the weak-kneed Labor governments in Western Australia and in Queensland. The Liberal Party of Western Australia banned fly-ins. Under my own party, under the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen, fly-ins were banned.</span>

                    </a>  I like that word 'corrupt'! There have been only two people in parliament in Australian history since the war who refused to take their superannuation, and, in the case of Bjelke-Petersen, he walked away technically bankrupt. So take that! And consider it, my friend. We were the only government in Australia that had the guts to take on police corruption. Have they taken it on in your state? No! Have you ever had an inquiry into police corruption in your state? Well, we didâand it cost us dearly. But we weeded it out. So we can stand in the history books and say, 'We, as one government, weeded out the corruption in the police force in Queensland.' And there was no-one ever found guilty of government corruption in Queensland, so you want to be careful what you say outside this place. You might cop a big defamation action for telling lies, because your ignorance of the facts is towering. I don't listen to you anymore. You don't deserve to be listened to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Your governments allowed fly-in mining, which took us from $200,000 a year down to $100,000 a year in mining, and those unions have just about had a gutful of the Labor Party. There is no secret as to the divisions in Queensland, and they're going to widen and widen because you people represent the lily-pad Left, not the hard Leftâthe men fighting for decent wages and conditions. Under free trade agreements, you put us in there competing against countries that have no arbitration system at allâcountries like China. I mean, people work there for nothing, and we've got to compete against them. So our workers have to increasingly work for nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, the Labor Party was responsible for bringing 640,000 people who were eligible for work into this country every year, in an economy with only 200,000 jobs. So hang your heads in shame! Why were they bringing them in? I'll tell you the effect it has had: it undermines our pay and conditions and takes our jobs off us. The current head of the ACTU said: 'One out of every two jobs created from 2013 has gone to a temporary worker.' That's a good situation, isn't it!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  The Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 amends the Customs Act 1901 to implement Australia's obligations under the trade agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement Australia's obligations relating to goods under the same three free trade agreements. These agreements will contribute to Australia's prosperity, create jobs and boost Australia's investment and exports across the Asia-Pacific. This legislation is necessary for Australia to ratify the Indonesia, Peru and the Hong Kong free-trade agreements. Under IA-CEPA, over 99 per cent of Australian goods exports will enter duty-free, or under improved arrangements, building upon the 85 per cent in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, and Indonesia will guarantee automatic issuance of import permits for key products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 99 per cent of all of Peru's tariffs will ultimately be eliminated under the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement ensures that Australia's existing duty-free access is guaranteed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the parliament to pass these bills without any further delay so that Australian businesses, exporters, workers, investors and farmers can benefit from these three agreements. What business wants and what these agreements deliver is certainty. Business, farmers and peak bodies from across the Australian economy have called on their parliamentarians to get together and get this done. The government wishes to thank the Labor Party for supporting these important bills, which will help grow Australia's export opportunities across the Asia-Pacific. The passage of these bills is an important step in implementing the trade agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong. At a time of global uncertainty and trade tensions this shows that the Morrison Liberal and Nationals government is creating more opportunities and better market access for Australian farmers, workers, exporters, investors and businesses. As a nation that has long depended on trade and investment, these agreements will open a new chapter in Australia's trading relationships across the Asia-Pacific. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment deals with the very pernicious clauses that are in these agreements that give corporations the right to sue governments. People may not be aware of what is in these clauses. They sometimes go by the technical name of 'ISDS clauses' but they have very, very real impacts. Because these so-called free trade agreements have effectively been written by big corporations with their representatives in the Liberal Party and endorsed by the Labor Party, these agreements give corporations the right to prosecute and sue governments when governments have the temerity to pass laws that are in the interests of the wellbeing of their own citizens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you an idea of how these clauses have operated in the pastâthis is not a fanciful issue; this is a very, very real issueâthey have been used to sue governments who try to take action with respect to plain packaging for tobacco. Peru, who is one of the signatories to one of the agreements we're talking about, was on the receiving end of an action when it passed laws that protected the rights of its indigenous people. Egypt, as I understand it, got sued by a French company because they had the temerity to pass legislation that lifted or addressed the minimum wage. So these clauses can have very real impact. And you don't go to a court to have these things heard. You don't go to some big court where the rules of procedural fairness apply. You have two or three people behind closed doors, using secret rulesâthey don't even need to be judgesâand interpreting the agreements, and then they come up with decisions that say, 'Yes, you're right, Big Corporation, that country is trying to do things that benefit the environment,' or its workers or its first inhabitants. 'That country now has to change its laws.' We're not even talking about compensation here; you can be forced to change your laws as a result of this, because all of a sudden you're found to be non-compliant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why so many people have objected to these agreements. If they were just free trade agreements between two countries, that would be one thing. But, when big corporations from another country are able to tell our government what to do, that is a problem. It's why the former Chief Justice of Australia rang the alarm bells and said just in the last couple of years, 'We are at risk of trading away Australia's judicial sovereignty,' and he is right. He is right. If you don't want to believe the Greens, if you don't want to believe the unions who have pored over every detail of these agreements, if you don't want to believe people in civil society, if you don't want to believe the Labor Party members who voted against it at their own conferenceâbut are now going back on thatâthen listen to the former Chief Justice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's something we can do about it. We don't have to accept the hand-wringing of unenforceable side letters from the trade minister, from the very same government we've been told for the last couple of weeks by the Labor opposition that we shouldn't trust because they're loose with the truth. Well, if they're loose with the truth, which I agree with, you shouldn't believe something they've written in a side letter! We can actually do something here. We don't need to wait for a change of governmentâand I for one hope a change of government comes very soon, and it can if we start standing up to them instead of agreeing and rolling over and letting them tickle our tummies all the time, which is what's happening at the moment. We could pass this amendment and do something substantial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is saying to the government, 'We've just had the second reading vote. We didn't get our way. I opposed it. A number of others did as well. Fine, you're going to go ahead with itâbut, if you're going to go ahead with it, then park it until you've gone back and taken these terrible clauses out of the agreement.' A lot of people in this place think these clauses are wrong, so we're saying to you: if you want to have your agreements, then, fine, have your agreements, but go back and renegotiate to strip out these terrible clauses. If you want them that much, go back and take these clauses out, because we know that these clauses do harm. These clauses prevent governments from doing things that their people have elected them to do. There is no reason not to support this amendment, because if everyone, whether part of a party or an Independent, sitting here says, 'We don't like these,' then we can take them outâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  On the issue of sovereignty, I remember raising it when I was in the party room on the conservative side of the parliament, and the then leader, from the electorate of Mayo, said, 'There is an issue of sovereignty,' and the member for Melbourne is quite right in raising that issue. Time has moved on very dramatically from then. There might have been two blackfellas here in Canberra, 250 years ago, saying: 'These whitefellas are real good. I get blankets off them and I get trinkets off them and I get mirrors off them. They're really good blokes. I'm right in with these whitefellas.' Well, that may not have been a really good idea for the Australians who were here then. Is there any difference to the people here in Canberra today saying, 'Oh, yes; this is great for us. This foreign investment is just marvellous. We're getting so much out of it'? I don't know what we're getting out of it. In Queensland, we provided the money to build the railway lines into the mines. We provided the money to build the ports, and the people of Queensland owned the railway lines and the ports and benefited from it. With the federal government under Doug Anthony during that period, we maintained ownership of all of our airports. We don't now. It's very hard to find what exactly we as Australians do own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne is quite right in his comments that you are giving away your sovereignty and making the same mistakes that we as Australians made 250 years ago. People will curse your name. The history books will curse your name. They'll say, 'Who gave this country away?' Already people cannot believe that the two sides of this parliament sold all of our gas reserves for 6c and we're now buying the gas back for $16. We can't afford to buy it, so industries are closing throughout Australia. Many of the great industries of my electorate are under very serious threat because of the price of gas. The state member, Shane Knuth, a member of our party, says it constantly. Mr Beattie got up and told us that, if we opened the door to competition in the electricity industry, prices would go down. Competition would drive the prices down. Well, we went from $670 to $2,400 a household on the free market. To me it is extraordinary. We had the free market agreement with the United States. They wanted quarantine laws emasculated, and they got exactly what they wanted. It's oversighted now by a body which is half American and half Australian. That's exactly what they wanted and they got it. They wanted pharmaceuticalsâvirtually an open-door policyâand they got it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three things we wanted, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>: dairy access, beef access and sugar access. As you're well aware, I represent a major part of the Australian beef industry. We always got a fair go from America. I really can't complain. As to why we needed some extra access, I don't really know, because I've never received a complaint about access into the United States. I've represented probably the biggest beef area in Australia for almost 50 years and I've never received a single complaint. So forget about beef. The benefit to the Australian dairy industry was one ice cream per week for every dairy farmer. That was the benefit they got out of it. Nothing! And the sugar industry was wiped completely. So we got nothing out of it; they got everything they wanted.</span>

Now they're grovelling to the big corporates. You're watching the corporate colonisation of our country. I applaud the member. We may disagree violently on many things, but I applaud him and the member from Hobart for their strong stand and consistent stand. History will vindicate us and history will condemn the rest of you.</span>

I made a comment during my contribution in the substantive debate which goes to the ISDS clauses which wasn't rebutted by the minister, so I'm going to ask again if it's true. In our reading of these ISDS clauses that the Liberals and Labor are about to tick off on, the Peru one contains a specific mention of tobacco, the Hong Kong one contains a specific mention of tobacco, but there's nothing about tobacco in the Indonesia agreement.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I think that has belled the cat, because in the Hong Kong agreement and in the Peru agreement there is mention of both health and tobacco but in the Indonesia agreement there is only mention of health, not of tobacco. If and when the first suit hits Australiaâyou have been put on notice, Labor and Liberal; you have been put on notice about the deficiency of these ISDS clauses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the opportunity to do something about it right hereânot just about tobacco but about the agreements in general. We can say, 'Go back and renegotiate.' I understand that people are hanging their hats a lot on the letter from the minister saying he is going to ask for the old Indonesian agreement to be terminated. But what if Indonesia say no? What if they never get around to it? What if the first action is taken before they get around to it? We have the capacity here to do something about it. We don't have to wait for a change of government or another election. We can do something here and now to say that big corporates should not be allowed to sue the Australian government about the things that matter to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's just pass this very simple amendment. It allows Labor and the Liberals to have their trade deals that they are both wedded to. They can still have them and still get their corporate donations from the same corporations that are going to benefit from them. They can still go and suck at their teat, if that's what they want to do. But at least pass an amendment here and now that says big corporations cannot sue the Australian government, like we've seen with governments around the world, because we take action around minimum wage, around tobacco, around protecting Indigenous Australians and around the environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I'll only take a couple of minutes of the chamber's time. Centre Alliance, formerly the Nick Xenophon Team, has had a very longstanding concern with ISDS provisions. We should not give multinationals the green light to sue our nation over our laws that we make in the best interests of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly touch upon the Philip Morris v Australia case from 2011. That took four years to resolve. That cost taxpayers time and money. The reason for that is Philip Morris thought they could use ISDS provisions to sue Australia for its plain packaging of cigarettes. Many countries are now looking at ISDS provisions and realising that they are not in their nations' interests, and I would urge the government to very strongly consider removing any ISDS provisions from any free trade agreement that we are about to decide and sign as a nation. We should never allow multinationals to have rule and control over what happens in this parliament. This parliament should only be for the benefit of Australians, for laws for Australians, and we should not allow multinationals to get in between.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I will take even less time than the member for Mayo. It would be wrong of me to not take this opportunity to point out that the whole issue of ISDS is particularly relevant to my home state of Tasmania. We're obviously a small state with a small economyâa state government with a small budget and small financial resourcesâbut we are one of the six states of the Commonwealth, and we should have equal standing with the other states. But in this regard, when it comes to investor-state disputes, we are particularly disadvantaged. What would happen if a large foreign company were to try and sue the Tasmanian government for its GM-free status? There is every chance that that foreign company would have the resources of, or more resources than, the Tasmanian state government. What would happen if a foreign company wanted to sue the Tasmanian government because of its extra-tough quarantine requirements on its aquaculture? Chances are that that foreign company would have every advantage over the Tasmanian government; it could, in fact, have more financial resources than the Tasmanian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am saying is that the ability for an Australian government to defend itself is even more pronounced when it comes to my home state of Tasmania, because it would be so much easier for enormously wealthy foreign companies, armed to the eyeballs with a legion of lawyers, to take us on. It would obviously put the Tasmanian government at a significant disadvantage if those companies were to take us on. So, if only for Tasmania, and things like our GM-free status and our extra-tough quarantine safeguards, this amendment from the member for Melbourne must be embraced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't see why a federal government can't, for once in its life, instead of being hostile to improvements from the crossbench, think, 'You characters on the crossbench have a good idea there; we'll take that on board and we'll actually support that amendment.' That would be in the public interest nationallyâfor all of the states that are represented here on the crossbench; that is, Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. It would be in all of our interestsâit would be in the public interestâif the federal government would swallow their pride and say, 'Good idea; we'll take that on board and we'll support the excellent amendment moved by the member for Melbourne.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen, there's been a vote in this House that says Labor and Liberal want the deals to go ahead. Okay; we voted against that, but we are now in a situation where it is going ahead. Because these deals don't allow you to go back and renegotiate individual termsâwhich is a flaw in the process, but that's where we're atâwe now have to take the agreement, as it seems, on its face. One of the things we can do, though, is say, 'Some problems with it have been raised, including around what's called labour market testing, which means advertising for jobs locally before allowing the use of classes of visas or provisions under this agreement; we want you to go back and negotiate something else before we enter into this.' That's what we should do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many, many people have raised the very legitimate point that, under these agreements, what you do is open up whole new categories of people who are able to be brought here through the loopholes without there having to be local advertising first. I want to be clear: there is nothing inherently wrong with saying, 'Let's have people who live overseas come here and have a chance to work.' Of course that can happen. But most people in this country would think, as a basic matter of principle, that you advertise locally first to check there's no-one available who wants the job or who could do the job with a reasonable amount of training. But what we've found under these agreements that have happened so far is that once you start opening up categories of people like contractual service suppliers, as are referred to in previous agreements like ChAFTA and are referred to in this as well, and give them the fast track around all of Australia's labour laws, they end up coming here and working and being exploited on below local wages and conditions. That is terrible for them. That is terrible for those people. I've even seen it in my electorate. They get brought here under a visa where the employer is able to say: 'You've got to do what we say because your ability to stay in this country depends on me. If you don't do what I say then I, as the employer, will deport you. We'll organise for you to be deported by revoking your visa.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has happened? In Victoria, for example, on our power networksâthe poles and wires that bring electricity to peopleâit cannot be said that there is a shortage of local workers available to do that kind of work, but we have seen instances of the big corporations bringing in people to do things like line maintenance at below local wages and conditions. These poor workers are told, 'If you speak up about it, we'll deport you.' In Richmond, in my electorate, they were building apartment blocks where they had people installing lift stackersâas if you can't find someone here to do it. People are working on construction projects more broadly across Australia, and they're getting paid about half of what people locally would get paid, and they're being forced to sleep in places where there are many to a room. None of us would put up with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are they doing it? They're doing it because they're brought out here on these promises of great deals, and then they're told, 'If you speak up, if you go to a union, if you speak to anyone else, you're on the next plane back.' Why does that happen? It happens because there are not provisions in place that require proper testing of the labour market hereâproper, decent advertising of local jobs. After you've been through that process, if you still can't find someone, there's probably no-one in this country who would object to you saying, 'We'll bring in someone else if no-one here is willing to do it.' But the point is that these agreements circumvent all of that. They now put in place new categories where it is clear the labour market testing does not apply with the kind of rigour it should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will say: 'It's okay. We've got safeguards in place and we've just written a letter to the Labor Party'âwhich they've been foolish enough to accept as being worth something, even though it's just a letter that doesn't actually mean anythingâ'that says, "It's okay; existing provisions will continue to apply."' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I very strongly back the member for Melbourne. I regret to say this because some of these farmers are my friends, but I've been into the accommodation. There are three beds on that side, one on top of the other, and there are three beds on that side, and I could not put both my elbows up. There was no space between the beds; just enough space to walk. Their clothing was stacked on sticks. They'd broken off branches of trees or they had some broom handles or something, and they just had their clothes on them. There was nowhere for them to hang their clothes. It was about a 25-metre walk to the toilets. They're probably paying $100, I thought. The bloke who was showing me around said, 'It's $150 a week they're paying in rent.' That's $150 a week to share a little room that's 10 feet wide and with six beds in it. Are they paying the industrial award rate? Yes, they are, but there's a little round robin taking place hereâthat is, they've got to pay the labour hire company back for getting them the job in Australia. Then the labour hire company pays the employer because the employer's getting a beaut deal. So there are lovely little round robins taking place everywhere, and they're quite legal. There's nothing illegal about them. When Keating said he was going to free up the market, I threw a boot at the wall because I thought: 'Is this bloke completely mad? Are we going to go down to Asian slave labour wage levels or are we going to close every industry in Australia?' There are only two possibilities. Our industries can't possibly survive competing against people that pay their workersâthe last time I looked, and this is a few years ago, in the United States, farm labour cost was $5 an hour, mostly to Mexicans, wetback labour, in agriculture, and over here it was $15 an hour. How can we possibly compete against this? We can't. There's no doubt that our wages are tumbling in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mining is probably the biggest employer in this country; the honourable member here for Western Australia would back me up on that. In mining, an experienced miner earned $200,000 some seven, eight, nine years ago. He's now lucky if he's on $100,000, and he has no permanent job. There's contractual work that might last one or two years, and he's living away from home. This is all as a result of your free trade, and it will just go down and down until we have the same labour conditions that they enjoy in Third World countries. The men that fought to bring these laws inâas I mentioned before, every time I walk out past, I salute Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy because he was fighting the same battles that the member for Kennedy is fighting 110 years later. Winston Churchill said that those who cannot learn from history will be forced to re-suffer it. That is what is happening here. Our wage structures are collapsing through the floor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne is absolutely 100 per cent right. I've seen the accommodation with my own eyes. I've been toldâadmittedly, I haven't got any documentary proof. That would be very hard to get. I'm not holding it against the employers. What are they supposed to do? It's a free market now, so they're competing against slave labour produced products from overseas. What should they doâclose their doors? You can't blame them for going down this pathway. And that is why some of us consistently and continuously oppose what has been disastrous for this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat: we have no motor vehicle industry. We have very little textile, footwear and clothing industry left. We've even managed to export a quarter of our electricity industry. Instead of having coal-fired power stations in Australia, we now have solar panel factories in China. We figured out how to do that. We were 90 per cent self-sufficient in petrol before this free trade agreement rubbish started off. Now we're three per cent self-sufficient in petrol. The last whitegoods factory closed in Orange, New South Wales, three years ago, so we've got no whitegoods. What exactly do we produce? We're down to two quarries. That's all. We're not a mining country. I'm a mining man. I've lived all of my life in and out of mining, and mining is when you dig it out and sell the metal. We dig it out of the groundâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  Can I take this opportunity to back the member for Kennedy on a couple of really important points he made. One was this practice with foreign workers who appear to be being paid Australian wages but are not. I have heard stories in Hobart from a number of sources that this is exactly what happens. A foreign worker on some sort of temporary work visa will get the Australian wage, but when he walks out the door he's expected to hand a portion of it back to his employer, the result being that those people are being paid substantially less than their Australian counterparts. That's why these foreign workers are so desirable in Australia, that's why so many of them are being brought inâbecause they get paid less than their Australian counterparts. That has a number of effects. It means that there are Australian workers who are not being paid instead and it means that those Australian workers who are being employed are suffering downward pressure on their wages and conditions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't claim that this isn't happening. For years I have been hearing stories around Hobart. We've been very lucky to have a commercial construction boom in recent years, but at just about every big construction site in Hobart you will see foreign workers. You will see foreign plasterers, foreign tilers and foreign glaziers. You can't tell me that we donât have plasterers and tilers in Australia who aren't looking for work. Of course we do. Sure, they may be in short supply in Hobart, because we've got a construction boom in Hobart, but you can't tell me that there aren't tilers and plasterers, among other trades, in Melbourne, in Sydney and, in particular, in regional mainland cities, who aren't looking for work. Of course, they are out there looking for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system is not working, and the simple and undeniable fact is that these free trade agreements are costing Australian jobs and creating downward pressure on wages and conditions for Australian workers. This nonsense from the government and, I suspect, from the oppositionâin fact, I know that it is from the opposition, because during the 43rd Parliament there was a real surge in the number of foreign workers coming into this countryâthat these foreign workers are not costing Australian jobs and that these foreign workers are being paid Australian wages and enjoying Australian conditions is just not true. The government and the opposition know that. Either they know it and they are wilfully ignorant or they are clueless. If people like me walking the streets and talking to construction workers in Hobart can see it, surely the government and the opposition should be able to see. The member for Kennedyâway up there in North Queenslandâis aware of it. So we can only assume that the government and the opposition are either wilfully ignorant or are well aware of it and they are misleading this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I thought that Labor or Liberal might rise to talk and say, 'No; it's okay; we don't need these amendments because we've got these great side letters that we've just exchanged. So don't you worry about that; it'll all be fine.' The fact that neither of them are prepared to get up and defend these agreements and rebut the points that I'm making tells you everything that you need to knowâthat they know that the points I am making are true. They know that, in these agreements, you will be able to bypass Australian labour law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were here on this issue with ChAFTA, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, where we tried to get some protections to stop the circumventing of Australian labour law. And what happened? Well, Labor sold out the electricians on that one. With that agreement, we ended up with classes of workers, contractual service suppliers and other independent contract people who were able to come in and bypass the existing labour laws and any other agreements that might have been put around the side to give the fiction that there was going to be some proper labour market testingâand we have seen it come to pass. Now, we are back here again with the same provisions about introducing whole new swathes of workers that allow you to bypass Australian labour lawâand they can't even be bothered to get up and say, 'No, it's all right; we fixed that this time,' because they know that they haven't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why so many working people and their representatives have worked so hard to get a change of position from at least one of the parties in this place and for them to say: 'We've got to start saying no to these labour market testing provisions and to allowing Australian labour law to be circumvented. We've got to start putting in a hard floor in this country so that, no matter where you come from, you get Australian wages and conditions when you work here, and that involves some rigorous labour marketing testing and rigorous checking to make sure that there aren't some locals who can do the job first.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been debating this for many, many yearsâand we've certainly been debating it since the China free trade agreement. I note that one contributor from the opposition said that someone will come in here and start trying to make some cheap political points. Well, no, we have been raising this year after year because there is a problem, and you know there is a problem! You don't even have the courage to get up and speak to these amendments, because you know that you are about to vote to create huge loopholes that will allow plane-loads of exploited overseas workers to fly through. That will be bad for them and it will be bad for local wages and conditions as well. You know it!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a one-seat majority and if we worked together and took the fight up to this government, come the next by-election they could be out on their earâand there will be a by-election during this parliament, because there always is. But if Labor keeps going over to the government and saying, 'Oh, yep, we'll side with you on that,' every time the government wants tax cuts for the rich, and says 'Yep, we'll vote with you for that, like we did last week,' every time the government wants to rip $4 billion out of education, then you are just giving this government kudos it doesn't deserve. You are facilitating their agenda, Labor! We should be standing up to them and presenting an alternative, rather than doing exactly what they want. I accept that maybe Labor wants to vote with the Liberals to give tax cuts to the rich, instead of voting with the Greens, and maybe Labor wants to vote with the Liberals to rip $4 billion out of education, instead of voting with the Greens, but I would have thought Labor might vote with us to protect workers' rights. But it is left to the Greens and the crossbench to say, 'Let's address these problems.' Do you know why? It is because we are not on the payroll of the big corporations, but Labor and the Liberals are. Every time the big corporations say that they want the right to do whatever they like to undermine your hard-won and hard-fought-for local labour laws that have taken you over a century to build up, Liberal and Labor ask, 'How high do you want us to jump? How much do you want us to trade off?'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there were any time to stand up to the government, it is now. I am deeply sorry that there wasn't a change of government at the last election. There wasn't, but now we have the chance to do something about it by standing up and presenting an alternative. So, I say to Labor: Look at it. You are the oppositionâthe clue is in the title. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Let's just talk about the politics of the people of Australia. I'm a very humble man, Deputy Speaker McVeigh. I have much to be humble about. I wrote a book and it was the best-selling history book in the year it came out. Murdoch Books used Kevin Rudd to launch it in Sydney, to over 1,000 people, and Barrie Cassidy to launch it in Melbourne, to over 1,000 people. I have great faith in the Australian people. If I do, then I believe they're going to slaughter these two parties. There was a little group called the Labor Partyâmy family are very wealthy and very powerful but they backed the labour movement with every ounce of energy that they had. We had seven seats in Queensland and eight seats in New South Wales. Within 15 years we controlled the parliaments of Australia and ran Queensland for the next 50 years straight. We won every seat outside of the south-east corner and every election for 50 years. But what you don't see is happening. Tony Abbott stood up in this place and led the clapping to congratulate the then trade minister on the free trade deal. The minister sold the Port of Darwin and then went on $880,000 a year from the Port of Darwin owners the next year. Tony Abbott stood up and clapped, as did all of the Liberal Party, all the little sycophants that are in this place. I said to the honourable member for Clark, 'He's finished. He will never survive this.' Within three months he was destroyedâcompletely. Now, if you think you're going to get away with continuing down this free trade pathâpeople wonder why we're associated with itâI was there in the room when Michael O'Connor tore into the Labor Party, like I'd never before heard anyone at a public meeting rip into a Prime Minister, over the section 457 workers. These people actually didn't do that; it was the Labor Party that did it. They were bringing in about 30,000 and then Labor came in and they brought in 165,000. O'Connor was quite right. He's providing the money for the ALP and he's getting a big kick in the backside and a kick in the head from them in this place with their free trade deals. There is not the slightest doubt that the member for Melbourne and the member for Clark are dead right. If you're seriously going to say to the Australian people that it is not going to undermine their pay and conditions, you have to assume every Australian is a drongo and a mug. We've got it terribly wrong many times in our history, but the Australian people always get it right in the end. That's the problem for you mainstream parties. You won't keep getting away with it.</span>

Nothing in the agreements changes Australia's workplace laws, nor do the agreements allow for the exploitation of working holiday-makers. All workers in Australia, be they Australian nationals or foreign workers, are treated equally under Australian workplace law. Nothing in the agreement allows foreign workers to work without the necessary licensing or registrations. The government will continue to take steps to ensure working holiday-makers are not exploited and, if required, are qualified for any work that they undertake.</span>

Those democracy leaders are now asking us to do something very straightforward. Those democracy leaders said, 'Don't proceed with this agreement, because of the pressure that we are under, because of the assaults that we are under, because it will strengthen the case against us.' On this issue, Labor and the Liberals supped together, but you'd also find the Productivity Commission saying, as with the Greens, that we should have independent analyses into all of this. This is a day when a number of right-thinking people across the spectrum, no matter which political position you come from, are saying, 'Hang on, we should not be proceeding with this.'</span>

I don't think I've ever done this before, but it's worth doing because they report that Hong Kong pro-democracy leader, Bonnie Leung, has urged Australian MPs not to ratify a new trade deal with the Chinese territory unless human rights guarantees are inserted into the agreement. Ms Leung issued the plea to members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Thursday, saying Hong Kong had become a police state without accountability for those attacking the protesters. Ms Leung said Australia should use the deal to 'put some pressure' on the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. These quotes from her are important. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">They should pause the trade deal and put in some guarantees on human rights and an independent investigation on police brutality.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Iâm not asking them to scrap this deal. Iâm sure it will be beneficial to both sides. But more importantly if we are facing imminent danger, if we are about to be killed, what good is the trade deal for us?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put aside whether you think these agreements are good or bad. There's clearly a majority in this place that wants to proceed with them. Let's put aside all the other issues about labour market testing and corporations being able to sue individual governments and the loss of sovereignty. Let's just focus specifically on the one agreement and the one request that is being made of us at the moment. The democracy leaders in Hong Kong are putting their lives on the line. They told us to not rip up the agreement. They told us to not refuse to go ahead with it. They just said, 'Please give us some breathing space and send a message that what is happening now is not right.'</span>

It buys a year's breathing space for the situation there to unfold and hopefully resolve itself peacefully and hopefully resolve itself in the interest of democracy. We're saying that you can have the agreement. This amendment doesn't even seek to alter any of the terms of it, in effect. It does not seek side agreements. It just says, 'Have the agreement as negotiated, but send a message that we have heard the Hong Kong democracy leaders.' This agreement will not come into effect, to allow time for those human rights safeguards to be negotiated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government, people sitting on the backbenches of the Liberal Party, are out there at the moment, flaunting their colours and saying, 'We stand with the democracy leaders.' Well, show it. Show it by doing it really simply and really straightforwardly. Send a message back to the Chinese government saying: 'No, you have to do better than what is happening at the moment. You have to come up with a peaceful solution that respects democracy and that listens to democracy leaders. We are not going to put trade and money over democracy and lives.' That is what is happening here. Democracy leaders are pleading with us and saying that their lives are on the lineâ'Do not put money ahead of human life. Do not put what corporations want ahead of democracy.' That's what they're asking. This amendment would give effect to that, and I hope all of those people who have spoken out so strongly in the last little while will see their way clear to supporting this sensible amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I come from North Queensland. About quarter of our population have Chinese somewhere in their family tree. Our KAP member of parliament, Nick Dametto, in Townsville in fact falls into that category. The wife of my best friend Robbie Gough, a famous country music singer, is similar. I could go on. We are not anti-China, but we don't grovel or bend the knee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who read history books, the Order of the Knights of St John on Malta said, 'We're going to stop the Ottoman Empire.' Seven hundred knights are going to stop the Ottoman Empire, which had 245,000 of the best armed troops the world has ever seen! They dragged in 8,000 Maltese, gave them a sword and tried to teach them how to do something with a sword. The history books read that the Knights of St John won. They beat those 245,000. Little England faced off against the combined might of Italy and effectively Spain and most certainly France, Germany and Russia. Were they going to bend the knee? No. They said, 'We're going to stand up strong, and we will defend our island.' We all know who won that one. There is also a little country called Israel. You don't have to grovel if you stand strong. If you stand strong, then you will be respected and you will help those people in China get a better deal than they are getting at the moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne is dead right on this. Do we have any moral principles in this place? Clearly there are people being persecuted by a country who has, for the first time in recent history, a leader for life. The boss of the Chinese government has declared himself leader forever, for life. Do we applaud this? Do we stand aside and say, 'We're not going to make a moral stand here'? If you're standing up strong, then what about the VIP countries? We keep forgetting about themâVietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. They're going to stand up strong if they know some other people are going to stand up strong. We're not being aggressive, but we want the people of China to get a fair go and to be progressive and get the right to be progressive. I applaud the stand taken by the member for Melbourne.</span>

The Hong Kong government has signed and ratified the agreement in good faith, and it's in our interest to do the same. Hong Kong is our eighth-largest export market for goods and services. Given that we have FTAs with seven of our top 10 export markets for goods and services, ratifying the HKFTA is a top priority and makes sense. Having FTAs in place with both Hong Kong and China allows Australia to advance economic and trade interests in both jurisdictions and supports the 'one country; two systems' framework which has underpinned Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and business confidence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to introduce the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019. This bill recognises the unique nature of military service, and acknowledges and gives thanks to veterans and their families for the sacrifices they have made while serving in the Australian Defence Force. The government shares the Australian people's appreciation of the contribution made to our nation by our military, those who have defended Australia and those prepared to defend it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The welfare of veterans and their families remains a priority for this government. An annual statement to parliament on the government's ongoing commitment to veterans and their families has been delivered by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs each year since 2017, and I was privileged to deliver this year's statement just last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill sees the realisation of an Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant, where everyone can acknowledge, support and pay respect to all who have served or are currently serving in the Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, or Reserve. The Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant enables Australians from all walks of life to honour Australia's proud military history. The bill enshrines the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant in legislation, providing an opportunity for the nation to recognise the service and the sacrifice of all who have committed to defend the nation and those who continue to do so, and to pledge their commitment to support veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government acknowledges through this bill the sacrifices made by veterans and their families, and the challenges they may experience during and after their military service. Also recognised and acknowledged is that veterans can require additional support to be provided in a way that is appropriate and sensitive to their individual circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the covenant, anyone with a single day of service will receive a veterans card and a lapel pin once released. The card and lapel pin will provide a visual method for the Australian community and businesses to recognise a veteran and for veterans to recognise one another. Importantly, the bill also includes a statement in relation to the beneficial nature of veterans legislation to provide further support to the principles of statutory interpretation that determinations are to be made fairly, justly, consistent with legislation and similar type claims, and in a timely manner so that the public may trust and have confidence in the determinations made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, which has bipartisan support. This bill creates a new act which will provide a framework for government, business and community to recognise and acknowledge the unique nature of military service, and support veterans and their families. Importantly, this bill establishes the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant, which formalises or gives effect to the solemn pledge of a grateful nation to its veterans. It's an important development. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in this place would be aware that in September last year it was Labor who first announced that, if elected, we would establish a military covenant. Labor's proposed covenant would have covered both current and ex-serving personnel and their families, as we saw the need to recognise the commitment and sacrifice they make in serving our country by formalising Australia's commitment to provide them with the ongoing support they need. That is why Labor welcomes the government's adoption of a covenant through this bill. However, I must note that we would like to see the covenant extended to all Defence personnel, current and serving, as well as their families. It's unfortunate that what's before us today covers only those who have previously served, and their loved ones. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another notable absence from this billâbut part of Labor's proposal at the last electionâis an annual reporting in the form of a statement to parliament. We wanted this included to ensure that, whoever the government is, it is accountable for meeting its obligation to current and serving personnel. While we recognise that there is currently an annual statement to the parliamentâindeed, the minister delivered the third such statement last week, and I gave a reply to itâthat is purely a decision of government, a convention you have, not a statement to the parliament as part of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill was first introduced in the 45th Parliament, we raised concerns about the omission of these elements. We therefore referred the bill to a Senate inquiry so that the veterans community had the opportunity to view and provide feedback on the government's proposed covenant. This was followed by providing additional comments on these issues as part of a Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Legislation Committee inquiry report. It was Labor's view both then and now, and through thorough consultation with those who would be affected by the covenant, that this occur. Whilst it is regrettable and a missed opportunity that it does not include those currently serving, that doesn't diminish the overwhelming positives of this covenant. For this reason, Labor is willing to support the bill both in principle and in practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to not further hold up the passage of this legislation, we requested that the Senate committee conclude their inquiry by 22 March this year to enable both an examination of the legislation and the process to be completed in time to be reviewed by the Senate by early April this year. We believed that this was appropriate and would ensure there was time to review the legislation to enable the current and ex-serving community the opportunity to be involved in the process and not delay the passage of the bill. The committee indeed did report back on 22 March, recommending that the bill be passed without amendment. At the same time, Labor senators on the committee canvassed the issues of including current serving personnel and strengthening the reporting element, in additional comments to the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as it happened, while the bill was debated in April, there was not sufficient time for it to be passed in the House of Representatives in the final week before the election, and it lapsed, sadly. Given the Senate committee's recommendations and the broad support amongst veterans for the bill and the covenant itself, the delay in the bill's passage we found curious. But Labor is willing to be pragmatic and support the bill in its current form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to those who've served is formalised in this covenant, and it's vital we get it right. In addition to the introduction of a covenant, the bill inserts a general recognition clause, which acknowledges the unique nature of military service, the demands placed on those who serve, the additional support they require post service and the Commonwealth's commitment to supporting veterans, reflecting the fact that veterans have complex needs and need special support. Furthermore, it acknowledges the demands placed on and the sacrifices made by families of veterans. This is an important component and one which has not always been acknowledged, and it should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the reasons why Labor wholeheartedly supports this recognition and the ongoing obligation to those who put their lives on hold in service of our countryâand to their families, I might add. As an extension of this general recognition, the bill includes an overarching statement in relation to the beneficial nature of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislation, making it clear that the legislation has a beneficial purpose and should be interpreted accordingly. In this section we'll note that the Commonwealth has committed to ensuring that those who make decisions involving veterans interpret legislation in a way that benefits them and their families, where that interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the provision. I think that's a good legislative reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide for departmental training and a guide to ensure that decision-makers understand and appropriately apply the beneficial legislation to support the intent of this clause, and I'm sure veterans communities around the country would appreciate that. In addition, a paragraph will also be inserted that provides that claims decisions will be made within a time that is proportionate to the complexity of the matter, acknowledging the variety of complex client claims and that there will be differences in timeliness. One of the most common complaints about the Department of Veterans' Affairs is the lengthy and complex claim process. So any commitment to timeliness will be welcomed by the veteran and ex-serving communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill will provide recognition to veterans and their families in the form of lapel pins, veterans cards and other artefacts. Labor is broadly supportive of these kinds of symbolic forms of veteran recognition through items such as cards and pins. To the extent that the veterans card would be accompanied by a discount scheme, it was hoped that it would deliver tangible benefits as well. The government has completely botched the rollout, and veterans have been waiting for almost a year now for the card and the discount scheme and would have been struggling to get even basic information on what businesses were involved and the discounts available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the card was announced nearly a year ago, the only public commitment was made by Virgin Australia, who offered priority boarding. This was derided by many in the veterans community as a tokenistic gesture, and the offer was withdrawn. It's also unclear how the veterans cards will interact with other existing veterans discount schemes. Since that time, there have been no public commitments from businesses in relation to the card. There is widespread frustration among veterans over the delay, and cynicism about whether this is just a cheap stunt from the government. We hear that interest in the lapel pins has been fairly low. As to the veterans card, first it was going to be different from the DVA health cards, and then we found out it was actually to be rebadged and reissued as the DVA white card, at the cost of $11.1 million. It has been a complete mess from the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we hope that the government will address the implementation issues and that more information will become available about the veterans discount card and the practical benefits it would deliver. We also hope the government briefs the opposition and the veterans communities about that. Given that these measures were first announced almost a year ago and the bill is only now coming before this chamber, we ask just how serious the government was to introduce them if they announced this about 12 months ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strong feedback from veterans has been that these sorts of initiatives must be backed up by substance such as better veteran support services. While symbolic recognition is important, Labor too wants to see tangible support of veterans, including things like a more efficient military compensation and rehabilitation scheme; better access to health care, mental health and suicide prevention programs; and more effective civilian transition through training, employment programs and family assistance, just to name a few. That's why Labor supported the amendments to the bill made by Senator Lambie in the Senate as a good example about practical recognition and we will be supporting them here in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will ensure that the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs commit to a 90-day time limit on determination for claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, commonly known as the MRCA. While Labor notes concerns about legislative time frames for the processing of claims in general, we believe an aspirational target of 90 days for MRCA determinations is reasonable, realistic and achievable. This is because it would simply reflect what's happening already in terms of significant progress that's been made when it comes to assessing rehabilitation and compensation claims as a result of DVA's veteran-centric reform project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the average wait time for compensation claims in the MRCA come down in recent years below 90 days. For example, in response to a Labor question on notice in the last additional estimates, DVA advised that in 2017-18, the median time taken to process permanent impairment claims under the MRCA was now 78 days, the median time to process incapacity claims was 34 days and the median time to process liability claims was 72 days, all of which are obviously less than 90 days. That said, more recently, there have been reports that DVA is struggling to deal with a spike in claims through the online claims portal MyService and claims processing times have blown out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know DVA, like many agencies, has been hard hit by the ongoing funding reductions due to the efficiency dividend, which is affecting service delivery, and the department has pointed to the need for more staff to meet the needs of its clients. The government needs to make sure the department is properly resourced so it can do its job and meet the expectation of veterans. Any improvements or commitments to addressing the timeliness of claims will be welcome by Labor and by veterans' communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side hope these amendments will further incentivise the government and the department to resolve these claims that continue to blow out. In addition, we would have preferred that any legislative time frames be applied in a holistic way to all relevant veterans' legislations, not just to one act, not just to MRCA. However, Labor wants to be pragmatic and we think it is a useful first step and, in that time, time frames should be considered in context of the Veterans Entitlement Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act, known as DRCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rationale for considering legislative time frames is that there is now extensive evidence and research showing the military compensation scheme is having an adverse impact on the mental health and wellbeing of veterans and, in some cases, contributing to veteran suicide and mental health issues. A 2018 Phoenix Australia report, the 2019 review of this report and other literature by Professor Alex Collie, commissioned by DVA, have highlighted that aspects of the system such as delays in claims processing can have serious effects on applicants. As I said earlier, one of the most common complaints about DVA is the lengthy and complex claims process. While the bill already contains a general commitment to timeliness, we believe these amendments could help further mitigate the psychological impact of these processes. In addition, military compensation lawyers have pointed out Australia's military compensation system is one of the few systems that doesn't include time frames for responding to claims or for making decisions. Defence personnel in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand are all protected by decision-making time limits. In addition, every state and territory in Australia has time frames for decision-making under civil workers compensation schemes. The recent Productivity Commission inquiry into compensation and rehabilitation of veterans recommended the system be redesigned based on the best practice features of contemporary workers compensation and social insurance schemes. To that end, a 90-day time frame for determination would go some way to bringing MRCA decisions in line with best practices in schemes in other jurisdictions. Such a time frame would be complemented by an allowance for extensions to be granted in certain circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary: Labor is willing to support the amendments to this bill. Like Senator Lambie we want to improve the timeliness of compensation claims. In closing I thank all those in the veterans communities who provided feedback to us on our side of the chamber, lobbied for recognition for the military covenant, participated in the Senate inquiry into the bill and continue to advocate for veterans each and every day. Going forward it would be good to consider the ways we can strengthen legislation through regular reporting to parliament and inclusion of current serving ADF members and their families. However, we support the principles of the bill and acknowledge the support of those who served and their loved ones. Labor's commitment to those who serve or have served is rock solid, and we welcome the changes brought by this legislation that increase recognition for veterans and their loved ones. Fundamentally this bill seeks to provide greater recognition for veterans by government and acknowledges the unique nature of military service and obligation of those that served. In conclusion, this recognition is very important. It's a message from parliament on behalf of the Australian community that we honour and thank veterans for their service and we recognise the sacrifice that they and their families have made for our country. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

We should always, as many of the previous speakers have pointed out, strive to remember and recognise the sacrifice and service of our armed personnel and of their family members. Labor supports any efforts the government makes to recognise and to support veterans.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KHALIL:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Minister. We would have liked to see people currently serving in our defence forces included, but the government has decided not to include them. Nonetheless, the bill has the broad support of the veterans community, and Labor supports the bill on this basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk a lot about the decision a person makes to join the Australian Defence Force, a decision that is about sacrifice and love of countryâin many respects a difficult one, because of the pressure that's placed not just on that person who has made the choice but also on their family. Although people did not always have the choice to join, we as a society should always respect, recognise and remember that choice made by so many thousands of Australians. I think that recognition and remembrance of service comes in part because of the personal connections so many Australians have with men and women who've served. We have seen this amazing phenomenon of our Anzac Day celebrations growing over the decades and becoming more and more popular, particularly with younger people. Perhaps it is that personal connection, wanting to remember the service of a great-grandfather who fought and died in World War I, a grandfather in World War II or an uncle in Vietnam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of my uncle, who served in the Australian Army driving the Leopard tanks at Puckapunyal, and my grandfather, who was an Egyptian auxiliary for the British in Montgomery's Eight Army in North Africa during World War II. He used to tell me snatches of stories about that service. He reckons that he singlehandedly, with just his rifle, took prisoner a whole unit of Italian artillery. I was too young to tell whether he was having me on. He noted that the enemy Italian units he took prisoner just wanted to get out of the hot desert and to the relative comfort of a British POW camp in Cairo. I wish now that I had asked him more questions about that period, so that I could remember more and better. Now he has passed away and that opportunity no longer exists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's a bit personal, obviously, to many of us who have relatives who have served, but I think it's more than personal. Bills like this one come from our acknowledgement as a nation of something more than just the personal. Obviously, deep in our hearts, deep inside the marrow of our bones, Australians know, through the history of our nation, the service of two million men and women in uniform and the ultimate sacrifice of 102,000 diggers, that that is pretty much why we enjoy the freedoms of Australian democracy. I think we know that; we understand that. Our diggers today are deployed in some of the far-flung places that so many of our diggers are buried, such as among the rocky hills and deserts of the Middle East. Today, as did our forebears, they defend our nation, they protect our way of life and they defend our democracy, ensuring we can continue to enjoy the freedoms that we have. That is why Australians want to recognise and commemorate their sacrifice and their service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This covenant is another way that we will remember them. I've always stood in solemn respectâand I'm sure all of my colleagues here would have done soâat least intellectually understanding the history of that sacrifice. However, it never really hit me, at least emotionally, until an Anzac Day dawn service I attended when I was in Iraq in 2004. I spent almost a year in Iraq, posted by the Australian government in 2003 and 2004, working on a whole range of national security and counterterrorism tasks. There was the 2004 dawn service in Baghdad, at the Australian headquarters. You'd see, every morning at dawn, the coalition headquarters being hit by mortars and rockets, so the Anzac service had a particularly eerie feel about it, especially because of the backdrop we had. You would see tracer fire lighting up the pre-dawn and the background noise of helicopter gunships rumbling across the skies as we commenced the service. As the sun rose and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Last Post</span> was played, I saw the silhouette of the bugler against the blood-orange sky. At that moment, an emotion hit me that is difficult to describe. I intellectually knew that diggers all around me at this service were putting their lives at risk every day. They were protecting us as we moved around Baghdad and other parts of Iraq in the ASLAVs and other convoys, but those experiences really opened up a better understanding, a deeper understanding, of what the first Anzacs had to go throughâthose who paid the ultimate sacrifice in France, the Middle East and of course Gallipoli. How many more have made that same sacrifice since then? At that particular moment during the service at Baghdad, I felt an enormous gratitude for the generations of our service men and women who fought and died for our freedoms. I don't do it often, but I did shed a tear at that service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reminded through these experiences in my electorate of Wills that there's always more work to do to fully recognise our veterans. There are a number of veterans who live in my electorate, and there are those who are currently serving, with families in my electorate. We need to look after them when they return and look after their families and their loved ones if they don't. RSLs have obviously been doing this on the ground for generations. After the end of World War II, RSLs were at the very heart of many of our local communities and they played a huge role in supporting our veterans and connecting people through shared experience.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I visit the RSLs in my electorateâthe Coburg RSL, the Pascoe Vale RSL, the Glenroy RSL and the Fawkner RSLâand speak with some of the older diggers there, but unfortunately I don't see a lot of the younger ones. The next generation is largely missing. A lot of the men and women who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor don't tend to go to these RSLs as much as previous generations of veterans. Maybe that's changing or it will change as they get older and they seek to be with their fellow veterans in a setting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many from the more recent conflicts who are struggling. Many of them are struggling; many families are struggling. A lot of veterans have issues such as PTSD and they have mental health issues. The issues are not just physical; they are emotionally affected by what they've seen and what they've experienced. It's really up to us to not just recognise them, remember and commemorate. That's all very important. Those Anzac Day services and Remembrance Day services that we all attend are critically important to keep the memory alive.</span>

No matter where or when the person served, we as a nation should always recognise and remember those who gave the ultimate pledge of service to our country. It is our responsibility to protect who we are and the freedoms that we hold dear, in the same way that they did for us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  Before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and join with the remarks from the member for Wills and acknowledge the unique service to his country that he provided, which I think was quite exceptional and should be recognised, along with the service of all members in this place. Earlier this year I had the privilege of presenting a unit citation for gallantry to my constituent Geoffrey Eaton. Geoff was a private on the front lines during the battles for fire support bases Coral and Balmoral during the Vietnam War. He did me the honour of requesting that I present him with the citation, in lieu of his unit's commanding officer. At the presentation, Geoff told me his story and described some of the harrowing experiences he went through during those days in 1968. It was another moving reminder for me of how critical it is that we appropriately recognise and acknowledge our veterans' service. I believe that today's bill is another important step, both practical and symbolic, towards proper recognition for all of our former service men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August last year I held a Fisher veterans forum at the Caloundra RSL, in my electorate. I invited then-senator Jim Molan to take part in the forum. The veterans we spoke with were passionate about the importance of service and the ADF. They were modest about their contributions and, most importantly, they were passionate about supporting one another. When it came to the help they wanted from government, the message was loud and clear. Veterans want the support that we provide to be straightforward to access and they want practical, pragmatic solutions. It is clear from this concise and well-designed bill that the government has heard that feedback, having created a Veterans' Recognition Program that is practical and straightforward. I want to thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his efficient and committed work on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House, the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, has two aspects. One sets down clearly in legislation the commitment that the Commonwealth government owes to veterans in return for their selfless service to our country. The second sets up the legislative framework for some of the government's simple and practical measures to aid in the further recognition of veterans in the community. The first aspect, part 2, lays out the minimum that veterans can expect from our community in return for their service. The second aspect, part 3, sets up the means for our community to go further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Service to our nation is, at the best of times, exacting and tough. It imposes great discipline and even in peacetime exposes men and women to risks that are not faced in civilian life. Service in peacetime requires sacrifice of time, of freedom, of comforts and of family. It can involve long stretches away from home in unfamiliar and hostile places. As we've seen recently in the Queensland floods, it can require a willingness to go into situations that others are seeking to flee and to deal with the worst that nature can do to ordinary people. It's physically demanding, emotionally tough and psychologically stressful. In times of conflict, while on deployment there is another layer of sacrifice that is hard for civilians to imagine. Few of us understand what it is to intentionally risk our own lives. Few know how it feels to be vulnerable to armed attack or to watch close friends and colleagues be injured, or even killed. Service men and women in conflict zones live with constant stress and privation from the luxuries of home. They can be required to deal with the worst of human suffering and to operate effectively in almost impossible situations. It's clear that these experiences, these sacrifices, are like nothing else in a person's life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore right that the government recognises and acknowledges the uniqueness of that sacrifice in this bill. It is absolutely right that the government acknowledges that those who return from service of this kind may need special support with their health, with getting new employment and housing, and with enjoying some of the day-to-day activities in which we all take part. We owe our service men and women a great debt. It is right that the government, with this bill, acknowledges that in fulfilling that debt it must provide the care and support that veterans need to participate in education or employment, or to achieve economic wellbeing and sustainability. This represents, I believe, the government's acknowledgement of the least that we can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the bill provides the government with the ability to go further. By authorising the production of visible symbols of service, including the lapel pin and the veterans card, which will form part of the coalition government's Veterans' Recognition Program, we will make it easier for individuals and organisations to provide extra acknowledgment in veterans' day-to-day lives. This may be as simple as a thank you in the street or a seat given up on the train, but it might include discounts, concessions or other special offers made by businesses and organisations in the community. With the proposed covenant, a uniquely Australian oath in its unpretentious simplicity, this bill also provides a means for all of us to buy into these same commitments. Alongside our government, alongside businesses and community groups, the covenant gives ordinary Australians the opportunity to give thanks and to acknowledge the debt we all owe to our service men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've sought in my own way in my electorate of Fisher to create more opportunities to acknowledge our veterans. In the process I have encountered one of the very challenges that this bill will overcome. On 11 October last year I held the first annual Sunshine Coast Veterans Day. I worked closely with Fisher and national icon Australia Zoo to provide free entry to the zoo for a day for all veterans and their partners. I received significant support from our local RSLs, including, especially, the nearby Glasshouse Country RSL sub branch and local veterans organisation Wet Vets. Mates4Mates held their regular catch-up at Australia Zoo. In total, hundreds of former service men and women visited the zoo to enjoy the unique wildlife experiences throughout the day. I'm grateful to Wes Mannion, Bill Ferguson and the Irwin family of Australia Zoo and to Jamie Hope of Wet Vets for helping me organise the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to say that we've already set up and announced the second annual Sunshine Coast Veterans Day, on Monday 28 October. This year the Minister for Veterans' Affairs himself will be joining us on the day to share the experience and chat to our service men and women past and present. Once again, I want to thank the zoo and our local RSLs, especially Brian Machin, Wendy and Dave Siebrecht and Nick Shelley of the Glasshouse Country RSL sub branch, for helping me to promote the event. I'll be having a stall at the zoo. I'd encourage current and former service men and women, whether they live on the Sunshine Coast or not, to come along, enjoy the zoo's terrific experiences for free and pop by my stand and say hello.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sunshine Coast Veterans Day has received terrific goodwill and support from everyone involved, but we have faced challenges in putting it together. Perhaps the most important has been appropriately identifying veterans. Without a universal identification card it's been difficult to create a clear and appropriate means of confirming their status. We had no desire to challenge veterans or to grill them on their service, nor did we want any confusion among the zoo's many ticket desk workers as to eligibility for the scheme. In the end, last year, it was necessary to trust to common sense and to the community's goodwill. The provision in the bill before us today for a single, clearly marked veterans card will make this process significantly easier for everyone in future years. The veterans card, the veterans covenant and the lapel pin are simple, practical and timely measures that will enable our community and local businesses to get behind the recognition of veterans and easily offer them the thanks that they deserve. I urge them to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I want to acknowledge once again the work of my constituent Graeme Mickelberg and his son, the hardworking state member for Buderim, Brent Mickelberg. Graeme and Brent both served in the Australian Army and have been tireless proponents of greater recognition for veterans for many years. Brent has consistently highlighted the challenges of transition for recent veterans and has spoken movingly in the Queensland parliament about post-traumatic stress disorder, which made his own return to civilian life so very difficult. Graeme is a passionate man whose insistence and tenacious advocacy is impossible to ignore. After 40 years of service as an infantry officer at home and overseas, he is as knowledgeable as he is determined, and he deserves a great deal of credit for helping to bring about the bill before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As far back as May 2013, Graeme wrote in the Sunshine Coast's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hinterland Times</span> that Australia would be well served to consider a military covenant that recognises the unique nature of military service and enhances the respect accorded to Defence Force members and veterans. Since then both Graeme and Brent have joined me in Canberra to meet with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and have been a very active part of supporting the development of this veterans recognition program. I know that Graeme and Brent will be very pleased to see this bill making progress today. I want to thank them for their hard work on behalf of veterans on the Sunshine Coast and all over Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of everyone here today in this place, I would like to honour all of those on the Sunshine Coast and all over Australia who serve or who have served in our nation's armed forces. We thank you for your service, and we remember their families, who have lived with separation and often with fear of what may come. This bill contains not only a landmark acknowledgment on behalf of the government of our responsibility to honour that service but practical steps to help our community to go further. In the words of the new Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant: for what they have done, this we will do. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  Imagine a country where a man or a woman who has served their country in uniform requires assistance from the government and gets it without having to jump through a tortuous serious of loops; where veterans can call the DVA and get hold of someone straightaway who then goes out of their way to help that veteran in every way they can, who regularly stays in touch to keep that veteran informed of the progress of their concernâa country where the DVA treats every veteran with courtesy and respect. We are not in that country yet, but it is hoped that the passage of this bill will get us closer to it. Labor are supporting the Australian Veteransâ Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, just as we did when it came before the parliament in the weeks before the 18 May election. We all hoped, back in April, that it would get through the parliament before the election, but, unfortunately, that did not happen. I'm pleased the government saw fit to place the bill back on the parliamentary schedule on 4 July so that its measures can finally become law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does continue to harbour concerns that this bill does not cover currently serving personnel, but in the interests of bipartisanship and a speedy resolution, particularly as the bill has the support of the veterans community, Labor is backing the bill without amendment. Importantly, this bill establishes the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant. As members are aware, back in September 2018, eight months before the election, Labor announced that, if we were to win government, we would establish a military covenant based on the UK Armed Forces Covenant. In February of this year, the government presented its own version, absent the provisions for currently serving personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is symbolic. It enshrines in legislation the social contract established at the end of World War I for the nation to honour and look after our veterans. It does not create or give rise to any new legal rights or obligations and does not allow veterans to revisit or re-litigate previous cases or causesâfor example, around claims for compensation. The key difference between our promise on this side and the covenant the government subsequently put to the parliament is that ours would have also covered current Defence personnel and their families. Labor do stand by our view that excising current serving personnel from the covenant is a mistake, but we have no wish to put obstacles in the way of a bill that we otherwise strongly support and which we would have enacted if we were in government. In addition, Labor would have preferred to see in the covenant a requirement for annual reporting in the form of an official statement to the parliament on how the government is meeting its obligation to current and ex-serving personnel. Good intentions are one thing, but the prospect of shortcomings being exposed can serve as a handy incentive to action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania has a strong history of involvement in Australia's Defence Force and military activities. In World War I, approximately 15,000 men and some women went to war, from a small population of just over 200,000 people. Today, that would be like 37,500 Tasmanians signing upâthe combined populations of all the men, women and children in the towns of Sorell, Brighton, Longford, St Helens, New Norfolk, Deloraine, Bridgewater, Prospect Vale, Campbell Town, Sheffield, Westbury, Swansea, Cressy and Richmond in my electorate. Tasmanians again showed their mettle in World War II, Vietnam and the host of conflicts that have come since. And Tasmania's military history is a rich one. Fourteen Tasmanians have been awarded a Victoria Cross for their valour in the face of the enemy. In fact, the first two VCs awarded to Australians were awarded to Tasmanians. My own electorate of Lyons, a vast agricultural seat, is home to a number of Victoria Cross recipients, notably John Bisdee, Walter Brown, Lewis McGee, Harry Murray, James Newland and Percy Statton. Many of the small communities in my electorate remember with sadness and pride the departure of so many sons and the fact some never returned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've visited the Woodsdale Museum in the Midlands. Housed in an old schoolhouse built in 1884, the museum, founded by a group of enthusiastic history buffs and run entirely by volunteers, has been transformed through state, local and federal government grants, and it features heavily the region's contribution to the Australian war effort. Collected over time, the volunteers now have portraits of almost all the men and women who left this very small community to go to war. There are halls throughout my electorate with similar memorabilia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brighton has a long history as a military town. Troops destined for the Boer War and World War I trained in paddocks near the Jordan River, and a permanent camp site was built in October 1939 to train enlisted men. Sadly, the Brighton army barracks no longer exists, having been burnt down. Those who went to fight in later wars, particularly the Korean and Vietnam wars, also used this site for training. Although the camp burned down, the site's gates still stand, and a sculpture by local sculptor Folko Kooper has been erected just outside them in remembrance of the young men who marched through the gates as they headed overseas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I had the opportunity to support an application under the Stronger Communities Program for funding a statue in Magra, a small town just outside New Norfolk. This was for two local brothers, the Harris boys, who gave their lives in World War I and who now, proudly, have statues remembering their service looking over the local CWA hall carved out of cypress pines that were dying.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for a nation that shows such deserved pride in our military history and the contributions of so many men and women, we have failed utterly to look after those who make it home. This bill sets out to redress that failure, and I hope it's enough. But, if it's not enough, we must stand ready to do more and without delay. My office has been working with Brett, a veteran who's applied for invalidity benefits due to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. During his service, Brett, a highly specialised soldier who received high commendations and who lived for his service, regularly jumped from planes. His last jump caused an injury, leaving him unfit for operational duties.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  There is a waste crisis in Australia that has been brought into focus by the decision taken by China and other countries to stop receiving our plastic rubbish. The import ban has been driven by the recognition in China and elsewhere that a number of so-called recycling operations in those countries have in fact been burning or dumping a significant amount of plastic. So, while the immediate alarm is about the current stockpiling of plastic here and even the prospect of seeing freight containers of plastic rubbish returned, we should be concerned that for years we have blithely sent our rubbish away to be dealt with on a very poorly regulated basis in less developed countries, almost certainly to their environmental detriment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current import ban has shown our inability to reprocess and recycle plastic in Australia other than on a very small scale. We need to do a lot better at every step of the waste reduction hierarchy. We need to use less; we need to re-use and recycle more. That's going to require leadership and investment and regulatory reform. There is a great deal of community interest in seeing this occur, but it will not happen by itself. It will not happen through voluntary schemes. It's not going to be driven by some obvious market imperative or cost signal, because they don't exist. That's precisely why plastic waste in particular represents a gross market failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On current trends, there will be twice as much plastic produced in 2025 as there is in 2019, and each year up to 15 million tonnes of plastic is poured into our oceans, with a devastating effect on our marine life. As the shadow assistant minister for the environment, I have benefited from meeting with a series of industry stakeholders, including the Boomerang Alliance and the Australian Council for Recycling, among others. There is no doubt that our recycling industry is ready, willing and able to be part of major change led by government, if government can get on that path. There are businesses already showing what is possible. The other day I had the opportunity to visit Advanced Plastic Recycling, which has developed a wood-plastic composite that can be extruded into fence posts, bollards and decking at its plant in Adelaide. Companies like this need the support of positive procurement policies to underwrite demand. At the moment, where that does occur, it's coming from local and state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As in other policy areas, the coalition government has not done enough in the last six years to build on the national waste strategy and related reforms that were commenced under the Labor government. We now confront a waste crisis, and the question is whether the government will do something about it. I'm glad the Prime Minister has declared it will be a priority, but I'm concerned about the level of commitment to getting on with meaningful reform. Just as the government has had its belated waste awakening, we did learn last week that the PM had cancelled the December COAG meeting that was supposed to reach an agreement with the states on a strategy to stop waste exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the so-called recycling investment plan is predominantly bulked out with prepackaged or repackaged funds. The hundred million dollars in the Australian Recycling Investment Fund consists of nothing more than a fresh label on existing clean energy finance moneys. The $16 million over six years for the Pacific Ocean Litter Project has been drawn out of an already diminished regional Pacific fund within our aid budget. Under the government's plan, there is unfortunately no direct funding for recycling infrastructure and no leadership on a national container deposit or a ban on single-use plastic bags, both of which are being pursued at the moment by several state governments. There is no sign of the product stewardship scheme review, which we've been waiting for for some time, and there is certainly no reform when it comes to product stewardship more generally. And there is no commitment, as yet, to government procurement of recycled materials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the middle of the year, tackling waste has been touted as one of the government's signature policy objectives. That's a good thing, but I think in the Prime Minister's case it's been for the sake of distraction more than anything that, on the one hand, he has claimed that combating ocean plastic is a more important and immediate issue than climate change and, on the other hand, that Australia is somehow a leader in the reduction of ocean plastic through innovation. At the moment, neither of those things is true. What is true is that, until we see an effective form of national leadership, with corresponding action, Australia will continue to lag behind when it comes to waste reduction and resource management. That impacts on our environment, and it holds us back from the manufacturing and design innovation that should be the source of new jobs and economic activity in this country. It should be the basis of regional leadership in addressing the terrible scourge of ocean plastic, and that is taking its toll on our environment. It will ultimately take its toll on our health.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Menzies, Howard, Morrison: last week, the Liberal Party celebrated our 75th anniversary. In my maiden speech I mentioned that Lindsay is in so many ways a microcosm of the Australian community. It's got families; it's got retired people; it's got lots and lots of small businesses; and it's got a very strong community spirit. These are the words of former Prime Minister John Howard OM AC on his visit to Lindsay during the campaignâand, as I've said before, former Prime Minister Howard is always right: 'From Menzies' forgotten people to Howard's battlers to Morrison's quiet Australians, Lindsay has been and will remain a microcosm of Australia.' From working for former Prime Minister Howard to working with Prime Minister Morrison, it is now my responsibility to ensure the hardworking, aspirational people of Lindsay continue to be listened to and fought for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 70 years ago, Australia elected the first Liberal government. Since then, we have witnessed Dame Enid Lyons enter the House of Representatives and serve in cabinet, and Neville Bonner and Minister Ken Wyatt, our first ever Indigenous cabinet minister and Minister for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Robert Menzies extended an invitation to my dad in the early 1950s to come to Australia from a little town in Austria called Graz. In my early twenties, I worked for former Prime Minister John Howard, and he supported me during our recent campaign. Now, as I have said, I have the privilege of working with Prime Minister Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2013, the Morrison government has been getting on with the job of delivering jobs for Australians. Since coming to government, we have created nearly 1.5 million jobs. In Western Sydney alone, the Morrison government's $5.3 billion infrastructure investment will see 11,000 jobs created during construction of the Nancy Bird Walton international airport, and 28,000 jobs after opening. Our partnership and collaboration with the New South Wales government will mean that over 200,000 jobs will be created as part of the Western Sydney City Deal. That's just the beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak a lot about the commute I did from my home into the cityâover 15 hours a week over 10 years. Every day, 300,000 people commute out of Western Sydney for their jobs. As I've said before, my story isn't unique, particularly in Lindsay. It's about family, opportunities, aspiration, wanting a good job and working hard to get ahead for your family. I think this has always been the Lindsay way. The Morrison government are creating jobs for those people, and locally we're working on collaborative projects such as the Lindsay Jobs of the Future Forum, to prepare our local kids for those jobs that are coming in science, advanced manufacturing and even the space industry, as part of this great infrastructure investment by the Morrison government. As the Prime Minister said last week: 'There are more people in work today than at any other time in our history. And for more than 30 years, we have the lowest level of welfare dependence of the working-age population than any other time in that period.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having worked at the US Studies Centre leading a think-tank program, I know that the Liberal government has always had a very strong relationship with the United States over our 75 yearsâand our relationship with the United States is stronger than ever. Since we first forged a partnership at the Battle of Hamel in 1918, we have worked closely on our economic and security relationship while holding the same values and commitment to peace, prosperity and liberty. As our largest economic partner, the investment between Australia and the US is worth more than $1.2 trillion and it supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. We recently announced a partnership with the US on space and science and technology breakthroughs, and our two-way trade has grown almost 60 per cent since we signed the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. I was lucky enough to meet with US Chamber of Commerce representatives last month and discuss our very positive relationship. Our government is unlocking the potential between our two great countries, and this has been important for well over 75 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians elected our government to ease the cost-of-living pressures and unlock the potential here in Australia and with our international friends, including the US. I look forward to continuing to work for my community as we celebrate these 75 years of our Liberal Party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  For over two decades, Murray-Darling Basin communities have struggled with uncertainty constantly hanging over them. A combination of prolonged droughts, restricted water supplies, volatile water prices, water theft, water diversions, fluctuating commodity prices and ongoing disagreement between regions and states over water plans have all contributed to their woes. Like a growing world population competing for diminishing resources, too many vested interests are competing for diminishing water in the Murray-Darling Basin. In parts of the basin, the uncertainty has never been greater. Water supplies are critically low and could run out before the year's end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> The unprecedented fish deaths in the Darling are a confronting reality of the crisis being faced. The report by the Academy of Science into the fish deaths did not attribute the deaths solely to drought or climate change. In particular, the report highlighted a reduction of around 50 per cent in annual flows in some places on the river because of on-farm harvesting of water. The report also noted that the Menindee Lakes were full in 2016. That raises questions about the management and, in particular, the draining of Menindee Lakes by New South Wales authorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also questions about the accuracy of water inflow and extraction data. Water volumes are assumed to be accurate when in reality they are best estimates based on one or more assumptions. Whilst wrong assumptions are not necessarily intentional, estimates can be and possibly have been exaggerated to justify water-saving grants for various projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> The basin has been and, in the view of many, continues to be poorly managed, with each of the states and water regions operating differently. Of greater concern, the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been consistently undermined by competing vested interests. It has not been allowed to be rolled out as planned. Likewise, creating a water market has allowed speculators to manipulate the price of water and profiteer at the expense of desperate farmers who are forced to pay up to $800 per megalitre of water. Only water users should have right to buy water, and the market prices should be regulated. Recommendation 9 of the government's 2014 independent review of the Water Act makes reference to regulation of the water market. The recommendation was not followed through by the government, and I have little faith that the recently announced ACCC inquiry will restore stability into the price or supply of water. The decision by the government to abolish the National Water Commission in 2014, which Labor did not support, was short-sighted. Had the commission still existed, market manipulation may have been prevented and the water allocations would have been better managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of mistakes over the years, considerable investments have to date been made by food growers and farmers throughout the basin. People's life savings, their future and the future of whole communities are at stake. Their concerns are real. I note the growing calls for more inquiries and even a royal commission into the basin. My view is that there have been enough inquiries and that the underlying causes of the Basin Plan uncertainty are well known. The report of the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission, which regrettably was not fully cooperated with by all parties and whose report has been completely ignored, nevertheless comprehensively outlines the problems with the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. What is required is an independent, non-political, non-partisan body to assist the implementation of the Basin Plan to date, to have the authority to make any necessary changes to the plan, to factor in climate change, and to set out a long-term strategy that provides stability and fairness to all communities across the basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately the plan will only work if every community is committed to it, and that will only occur if every community has confidence in it. Over two million Australians live within the basin, and it produces more than 39 per cent of Australia's gross value in agricultural production. For some basin communities, the situation is dire. Farmers are already walking away from the land, their lives shattered. These are real people, with dependent family members. They deserve better. They don't need patronising words or more time-wasting inquiries. They need a government that stands with them, and a Basin Plan that they can have confidence in. For South Australians, being at the end of the system and dependent on upstream inflows, a sustainable plan is critical.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282982" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to update the House on a number of major projects in Reid, some of which the Morrison government committed to in the recent federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider myself fortunate to represent a community that loves sport and loves to be active, and I hold these values close to my heart too. It is incredibly important that our local sporting facilities offer residents and families the opportunity to have an active lifestyle, cultivate friendships and connect with the community through sporting organisations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently attended the opening of new facilities at Blair Park in Croydon. The federal government invested $1.3 million in the project, and has worked with Burwood Council and Burwood Football Club to see the project come to fruition. The upgrade has provided new field lighting, a new clubhouse with storage space, a picnic shelter and a playground. Burwood Football Club has not been the only one to benefit from the new facilities. Local schools will be able to use the park to host sporting carnivals and other school sports events. The new upgrades to playground equipment and a purpose-built bocce court have also been well received by local families in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to report that, in September, work began on a $1.6 million amenities upgrade for Cintra Park Netball Courts in Concord. The federal government has dedicated $1.2 million to the project, which was a key part of the Morrison government's 2019 election commitments to key sporting infrastructure in Reid. To have already broken ground on such a significant project only months after the election speaks to the commitment of our government to deliver for residents of Reid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amenities upgrade will include a new canteen, covered spectator areas, change rooms, a medical room and new administration spaces. I am pleased to be working with Canada Bay council and local sporting organisations to see this project through from start to finish. The Inner Western Suburbs Netball Association are thrilled to see the swift progress on the amenities upgrade, as their membership has increased to 3,700 members, from five-year-olds to senior players. This is a big win for women in our area, as the majority of netball players are girls and young women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Works at Strathfield Park have also commenced, after Strathfield Council received $1 million to update their amenities block. The new upgrade will provide male and female change rooms and toilets, kitchens, serving facilities, meeting rooms, outdoor seating and scoreboards. These new facilities will accommodate the growing number of people using the park recreationally or for sporting games. It has been a pleasure to work with both Strathfield Council and the Strathfield Strikers to deliver these outstanding results. I have visited the club to celebrate the end of their season, and heard from parents how much of a difference these facilities will make to their kids. I can also report that work on a number of other projects in Reid, including at Goddard Park and Timbrell Park, will be commencing soon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am passionate about improving our local sporting facilities, because participation in sport strengthens physical and mental wellbeing. These projects will help deliver fit-for-purpose amenities buildings to support the growth of local sporting groups across the electorate. I am particularly pleased that, with these upgrades, for the first time in many of these facilities, girls and women will have access to the same changing rooms and amenities as their fellow male players. It is fantastic that the Morrison government is supporting women's growing participation in sports by ensuring that all local facilities can be accessible and gender inclusive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that continually invests in our local communities through sport, and I look forward to seeing these projects roll out across Reid, knowing that their positive impact will be widely felt. I will update the House as projects progress.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  I'd hazard a guess that most members here think that their electorate is the bee's knees. I certainly think that Cowan is one of the best electorates in Australia, and I want to use the incredible privilege that I have here to advocate on behalf of the people of Cowan. I know that many of us come here and find it's a great forum for us to celebrate the achievements of people in our electorates, but tonight I want to talk about some of those people who don't get mentionedâpeople who haven't won medals or any major competitions, but who, in many ways, probably need us to talk about them more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people like Belinda, who's a grandparent but also a single parent. She's working full time and raising her two grandchildren. She was referred to my office by Grandparents Rearing Grandchildren after her nine-year-old grandson was rejected for the NDIS. My office helped her to appeal the case, and now her grandson is eligible for the NDIS and finally they are receiving the help that they need. I know that all members have cases like that of Belinda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the case of Caroline. She owed $740.90 to Centrelink, calculated as an overpayment on family tax benefit. The debt was written off in February and they advised Caroline of this in writing, but then, just in August, they intercepted her tax return and took the $740.90 without notifying her. Her presentation at my office meant that she got that full refund back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Sunali. She is a single mum and a survivor of domestic violence. Her son has just turned eight, so she has been moved onto Newstart, which means that her income is now smaller than before, but she is in her final year of undertaking a degree in speech pathology, and she has got some massive requirements to complete her degree. As a single mum myself, who did a postgraduate degree, a Masters degree and then later a PhD as a single mum, I understand how much the commitments of work and study can be, as well as the commitments of family, particularly when there has been family violence and particularly when, as is the case with Sunali, there has been trauma.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Sally. Sally is such a beautiful lady. She came into my office. She is 75 years old. Unfortunately, Sally is a victim of cybercrime. Unaware, she was duped by somebody in a $60,000 romance scam. She lost her house and $60,000. I often say to people, 'Nobody's ever won the Mexican lottery, and there are no Nigerian princes waiting to marry us, so be cyberaware and be cybersafe.' Currently we're helping Sally with the issues that she has from being scammed through this cybercrime scheme.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">GoshâJason. He is 29 years old. He was born with some severe physical disabilities. A few years ago he was told he was no longer eligible for a disability support pension and he has been on Newstart since. Because he couldn't complete school because of his disabilities and being away from school so much, he really has no prospect of finding a job and he's finding it really difficult on Newstart.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joy contacted me. She looks after her grandson who's nine years old. Her grandson's mum is a single parent on Centrelink benefits. Joy's grandson needs spectacles and she simply can't afford them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282918" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I stand proudly here today to share with the House the importance of Diwali to the Indian communities in my electorate of Chisholm. Diwali symbolises the spiritual victory of good over evil, light over dark and knowledge over ignorance. Diwali runs for five days. It is a beautiful display of Indian culture, often seeing women beautifully dressed, and homes and community centres brightly lit. On Saturday, I took the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the Indian Senior Citizens Association of Victoria, which is based in my electorate. It was great to visit the association again, since my election. The Indian Senior Citizens Association of Victoria started in 1995 with only a handful of peopleâabout six or seven. Two years later, in 1997, the organisation formally established themselves and they have been going strong ever since. The organisation has grown to hundreds of members and they make some amazing and valuable contributions to both the Indian community in Chisolm and the wider Chisolm community today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saturday's celebration was filled with traditional music, dancing and great food. However, I still managed to speak to members of the organisation and hear their thoughts and concerns. Some of the guests I spoke to have called Australia home for over 40 years, while others had only recently come to Australia. Regardless of who I spoke to, there was one common thing in all their stories. Like many migrants, they all came to Australia to build a better life for themselves and, most importantly, for their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as Australians should be proud of the fact that our way of life draws people from all over the globe to settle here. Many of the guests that I spoke to had migration stories that resonated with mine. I came to Australia 34 years ago. I was a student with no money, no family, no friends and very little English. Like many migrants, I came here with a determination to succeed. I raised my children in this country and I worked immensely hard to start my own business, as so many migrants do. I was actively involved in my local community, and my passion to make Australia a great place to live in is what has brought me here to this place in which I am speaking to you today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia embraced me and provided me with countless opportunities, and I know that the coalition government will continue to work tirelessly to provide opportunities for migrants to succeed. As the Prime Minister says, 'If you have a go, you get a go.' Migrants, after all, are an important part of why Australia is the great place to live that it is today, and we should all work together so that we can continue to contribute and make Australia an even better place to live into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story is not unique to me or to the Indian community of my electorate. It is the story of many migrants around Australia, who have come from different parts of the world. Whether migrants of today or from a few generations back, we can all proudly call this great country home. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for letting me speak on a subject that is so close to my heart and that I am truly passionate about.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I'd like to tell the chamber about my mate Bert Collins. Bert is the sort of bloke who deserves to have his name and his story etched into the record of this place. Bert was born almost 104 years ago and he's still with us; he's still ticking. He's a pretty extraordinary bloke. He's the oldest member of the Labor Party, at least in the Bankstown area. He's the oldest member of Bankstown RSL. He's been a member now for 58 years. He was the oldest veteran to march in the Anzac parade in Sydney this year. He's part of that very special generation of Australians that helped to fight, defend and save Australia in our darkest hour, and it cost him. He was hit by shrapnel but survived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's a pretty tough bloke, old Bert. He didn't just survive the war; he didn't just survive being hit by shrapnel. He had a heart attack a couple of years ago and he survived that. He has had a stroke and he has survived that. Two years ago he was diagnosed with stage 4 malignant melanoma. The tumour had spread to his brain, liver, bones and lungs, and he survived that. He's the oldest Australian to survive melanoma, to survive skin cancer, through the use of a special drug called Keytruda. I went over to see Bert on Friday. It's important that the chamber knows that, as well as being a tough bloke, he's also a very gentle and loving bloke. I asked him: 'What's the secret to a long life?' He said two things: first, don't eat too much and, second, be nice to everybody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow is my little boy Jack's third birthday, and Bert, who is 100 years older than him, has made him a music box for his birthday. And Bert got a present himself last week. There's an organisation that it's important the chamber knows about called Quilts of Valour Australia. Set up about eight years ago, it makes quilts, as the name suggests. They can take months to make. They cost hundreds of dollars to make. They're made by volunteers and, over the last few years, they've produced over 1,000 for veterans and their families here in Australia and for veterans serving overseas. Last week, Bert finally got his. It's a beautiful quilt, and it's a beautiful gesture for such a wonderful man as he heads into his 104th yearâa man that I'm very fortunate to call my friend.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I rise to congratulate the City of Mandurah RSL sub-branch on the opening of their new premises in Greenfields, Mandurah. I visited the club while it was under construction and enjoyed its official opening on Anzac Day this year, and it looks great. After two years without a permanent home, it's satisfying to see the City of Mandurah RSL with their own home again. Thanks and recognition must go to the Mandurah Bowling and Recreation Club, who hosted the RSL during their sojourn. I'm pleased to note the assistance of the Morrison government by way of an $8,400 grant for the installation of CCTV, alarms and lighting. This was an important part of the new build. It's great to see the government getting alongside the City of Mandurah RSL. It may seem a small thing but it did make a difference to the sub-branch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to recently present the Mandurah RSL with some modern memorabilia. A little while ago they approached me for some memorabilia that would reflect younger veterans' experiences and would also help complete the historical narrative. Of course, we celebrate World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam, so I was able to provide the club with four framed photos taken by my ASLAV gunner, Brenden, from our tour in 2009, as well as a painting by Stan from the SAS picturing two 1 Squadron operators. Brenden is now a surf photographer based in Wollongong, and you can check him out his handle on Instagram @beejonroy. It's great; he's a very talented photographer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note for the chamber that the City of Mandurah RSL has also been successful in its application for a further $4,870 under the federal government's Building Excellence in Support and Training grant program. The government provided $4.115 million nationally under the most recent round of the BEST grants scheme, which is divided proportionally among the ex-service organisations that apply. The BEST grants are important as part of the commitment to support ex-service organisations and our contribution towards the costs incurred in providing advocacy services to the veterans communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Dave Mabbs, the newly elected president of the City of Mandurah RSL. Dave has been an active member of the sub-branch for many years and is a fine choice for this position. I particularly want to note his service every Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, organising official events. I also acknowledge the outgoing president, Mr Brian Dillon, for his service and leadership in this role through a very busy and demanding time for the sub-branch. Congratulations to Dave and Brian for their service, both to our country and uniform but also to our local community through the Mandurah RSL sub-branch. </span>

                  </a>  This is a common feature of major papers right across Australia. This is what it looks like when our journalists say, 'Enough!' to a government fighting media freedom and the public's right to know. As a Labor politician and an avid newspaper reader, I believe a strong and independent media is vital to holding governmentsâand oppositions, for that matterâto account. The Right to Know coalition is an historic, united campaign fighting for press freedom. We know that police raids on media offices and the homes of journalists right here in Canberra should not be the norm. We know the country deserves better than a Prime Minister who is loose with the truth and who repeatedly avoids answering even the simplest questions that attempt to hold him to account in his office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Prime Minister I say: accountability isn't a 'bubble' issue. Nine out of 10 Australians tell survey researchers they value transparency. Only four out of 10 say it's happening right now. And, sadly, this is not a new issue for this third-term government. Under this Prime Minister, we've seen the government refuse to answer questions from journalists and from members of the public. Extraordinarily, when asked questions about the raids in an interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span>, the communications minister interrupted a third question to state, 'To be honest with you, I've said about as much as I'm going to say on this topic, and, if that's the only thing you're interested in talking about, then probably I'll draw the interview to an end.' They won't even talk about their attempts to silence the truth. We've seen the government ignore its legal obligations to provide information under freedom-of-information laws. We've seen them use criminal law to intimidate people who embarrass them. It's not acceptable in Australia. It's not acceptable in any democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My Labor colleagues and I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Right to Know coalition. We want the government to rule out prosecution of Dan Oakes, Sam Clark and Annika Smethurst. We want better protection for journalists whose only so-called crime is doing their jobs. We want whistleblowers protected and we want the government to answer questions put to it. This isn't a campaign for the self-interest of journalists; it's a campaign for democracy and for the right of every Australian to know the truth. To quote the Right To Know campaign, 'When government keeps the truth from you, what are they covering up?'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Bennelong is the capital of innovation. We have groups, from students to corporations, fighting to understand or change the world to make it a better place every day. I could talk about many locals and the difference they are making to improve our lives, but today I would like to focus on one very special person. I would like to congratulate a local resident of Bennelong who has conducted some extraordinary research into diseases and has been recognised with one of the country's highest prizes. Associate Professor Elizabeth New has pioneered the development of new chemical imaging tools to observe healthy and diseased cells. For this she is the worthy recipient of the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year, a prize which was awarded at the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science in the Great Hall last week. I was very proud to see her there to accept this illustrious award. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Associate Professor New has developed molecules that act as fluorescent sensors, emitting light to make the observation of complex chemical processes within cells possible. This will assist in the identification of potential treatments for diseases associated with ageing, for cardiovascular cancer and for diabetes, an important breakthrough considering that these diseases affect 50 per cent of the Australian population and contribute to 85 per cent of deaths. The imaging tools are revealing the critical role of copper in metabolic processes, new insights into cisplatin based anticancer drugs, and the study of oxidative stress in cells. Associate Professor New has an outstanding body of work, including 70 referred publications, with more than 50 as first or lead author; nearly 40 invitations to lecture at major conferences; and more than $5 million in research grants and $1.4 million in equipment grants. She is an award-winning teacher and mentor and has donated a significant amount of time to professional science organisations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the associate professor about the use of copper in treating progressively debilitating diseases like Parkinson's and motor neurone disease. My personal interest in this comes from the strange correlation between tennis players and MND. I have lost a number of close friends to this condition and I'm passionate about any steps towards finding a cure. A few years ago, I walked around the electorate raising money for motor neurone disease, and I am heartened by reports that copper is being used in a manner to slow the spread of this condition. From a personal as well as a professional perspective, I cannot thank the associate professor enough for the research that she is doing in making our lives better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  About a month ago I wrote to a Mr David Graham in my electorate congratulating him on his 90th birthday. To my surprise and delight he was kind enough to invite me around for morning tea in his house in Medina, so I went along and had a great old chinwag with David and his lovely daughter Lynne. It was a pleasure to chat with David and to share some stories about how the community in which I was born and grew up has changed over the years. He has lived in Medina for a very long time. I was born in Calista, the nearby suburb, also a very long time ago. David, like my dad, worked at the BP refinery and recalls giving my dad a lift home once from the CBD down to Shoalwater Bay after a Red Cross donors lunch in the cityâso it's a small world, over many decades. I'd like to thank David and Lynne for the kind invitation to come over to their home and to enjoy some lamingtons and a lovely morning tea. Happy birthday, David, and many more years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later that day, I also went to the official opening of the WA BMX championships at the Southern Districts BMX club, also in Medina. I'd like to thank BMX Sports WA for inviting me along, particularly President Warren Edwardes and the whole BMX WA board; my state colleague Pierre Yang, MLC; Kwinana mayor Carol Adams; and those councillors from the City of Kwinana that came along. It was an amazing day, with 500 people packed around the outside of a great BMX track. People came from far and wide across what is a massive state, from Mandurah and Busselton in the south, all the way up to Port Hedland and Geraldton in the north. I hope you had a great weekend of competition. I even enjoyed the minicross, which is a group of fearless two- and three-year-oldsâwould you believe it?âgoing across a bike track. The boys and girls were having a real whale of a time, increasing their coordination and having good fun. They went round that track again and againâthere was no stopping them. Congratulations to everyone that participated. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, when I was last in the electorate, I went to the City of Rockingham Pioneers' Luncheon. This is a celebratory lunch that pays tribute to those long-serving and long-term residents of the City of Rockingham that have been in the district for 50 years or more and have contributed to the community that we call home. I want to acknowledge the City of Rockingham for putting on this great event that acknowledges longstanding citizens of the city. My mum, Diana Morris, is a pioneer of Rockingham; along with her friend Fay Winter; old family friends Pearl Warner and Dr Bob Warner, who has served the community for many, many decades; and Lori Smith and Nola Smith. I want to thank them and all the pioneers of the city of Rockingham for the contribution they have made to our great community over so long. They enjoyed the lunch and got to reminisce about old times. It was a pleasure to be there, along with the Premier, Mark McGowan. Thanks to all those pioneers that make our city what it is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (10:44):  We hear a lot in this place about the Morrison government's commitment to busting congestion, so let me take a moment to explain why this is so important. It's because time spent sitting in traffic is far better spent either at work being productive or at home with friends and family, relaxing after a long day's work. Trackless tram is the vision of the City of Stirling, led by Mayor Mark Irwin, whom I congratulate on his re-election over the weekend. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Stirling is the largest local government area by population in Western Australia, with 220,000 residents. Over the next 30 years, this population is predicted to grow by 50 per cent. There are already 3,709 vehicles using Scarborough Beach Road every hour, and during peak hour that number accelerates to 5,000 vehicles per hour. Thankfully, the City of Stirling identified this problem early on and for the last decade has been championing the trackless tram project. At stage 1, the federal government has already committed $65 million to the Stephenson Avenue Road Network development, with the state also contributing $60 million. Stage 2 of the plan is to deliver trackless tram from the new Stirling City Centre to the iconic Scarborough Beach along Scarborough Beach Road. It will also link in with heavy rail at Glendalough station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A trackless tram is neither a train nor a bus. It looks like a train but uses electric propulsion and rubber wheels. It's half the weight of a bus, has no carbon or noise emissions, can recharge fully in 10 minutes and, importantly, can transport up to 250 people in three carriages per journey. This is ground-breaking technology that has the potential to transform the way we commute. It will unlock development potential along Scarborough Beach Road, enabling mixed use business and housing hubs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As those at the City of Stirling say, this is a big, bold vision. As we know, the Morrison government also has a big, bold vision for busting congestion, and I, and my neighbouring colleague the member for Curtin, believe in this vision and we are committed to seeing it become a reality. Working along with the City of Stirling, we aim to deliver trackless tram for the many thousands of residents who are set to benefit from this exciting project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Over the last two months Ballarat has really come alive with art, as the Ballarat International Foto Biennale has brought world-class photography to our regional community, including from some of our fantastic photographers in the press gallery here in Canberra. For over a decade now, the biennale has been the centrepiece of our city's increasingly busy arts calendar, and with every edition it's grown bigger and bigger, reaching out to more and more in our community. Two years ago, over 26,000 visitors came to enjoy the show, each with an unforgettable experience right here in central Victoria. This year, initial estimates suggest that over 35,000 visitors have come to our city during the biennale. Looking at the amount of yellow tote bags around the city and town and further beyond, so many visitors is no surprise at all. These tens of thousands of visitors have come to see the core program of works from world-class artists in world-class settings like the Ballarat fine art gallery and in other formal spaces. But, even beyond the core program, the biennale has truly taken over the entire city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great joys of the biennale comes from the art that you stumble across as you walk into a cafe, a restaurant, a bar or a store, and on the walls of laneways and those cafes are works that stretch beyond your imagination and make you consider those places in a new way. Our laneways, our cafes, our pizzerias, shopping centres, public gardens, churches and even bike storesâjust about every imaginable space in Ballaratâhave been filled with art. You wander into a space that you know so well and you see incredible art on the walls. It is such a privilege.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this gift to our community, thanks must go particularly to Fiona Sweet and her team of staff and the many volunteers who have made the biennale this year such a fantastic event. I want to thank them personally for all that they have done to the city. Our home is a much more exciting place because of their efforts, their initiative and their hard work. The chances that they have taken with the biennaleâputting on an international event such as this is not an easy thing to doâand with the purchase of one of our heritage buildings and the life that they're now giving to that in the new National Centre for Photography have absolutely transformed our city and the city's art scene forever. Opportunities are being provided for students, particularly from our public schools, to learn photography from some incredibly skilled professionals. Now, with the biennale finishing over the weekend, like the rest of the community I will spend my time looking forward to the next event, in two years time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Tourism in Northern Tasmania is booming. For the year to March, over 700,000 people were reported to have visited the north, up two per cent on the previous year. I may be biased, but, really, why wouldn't you want to visit? One day you could take a walk through the stunning natural beauty of the Cataract Gorge and then enjoy some incredible wine on the Tamar Valley Wine Route and the next day enjoy a dip in the ocean at Bridport and be on the world-class Blue Derby mountain bike trails by the afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Launceston's Cataract Gorge this year hosted over 800 tourism finalists in the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards. To have the prestigious national awards held in a regional cityâonly the second time it has happenedâwas a huge coup for the city, led by Rick Marton, whose passion and dedication were crucial in securing the event. A showcase for the incredible food by local restaurants and chefs, including Massimo Mele from Grain of the Silos and Matt Adams from Timbre, naturally our food and wine offering was a highlight, but I was particularly taken by a story that made the event a truly community affair. Organisers realised there'd be a bit of a juggle for visitors eating a canape whilst holding a drink and shaking hands, and they called on the talented resources of Men's Sheds at Rocherlea and Ravenswood, who produced 600 handcrafted canape boards for the event. Well done to all of those who made this event such a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also extremely proud of our world-class mountain biking trails in Northern Tasmania. The town of Derby has flourished in recent years as it has become an internationally acclaimed mountain-biking venue, twice hosting the Enduro World Series. The town has grown from strength to strength with the tourism boom. Some homegrown talent includes Tara and Steve Howell, with their award-winning Blue Derby Pods Ride. I commend the Morrison government's investment in regional tourism in Tasmania, including funding for a new Georgetown mountain bike trail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growth of our tourism offerings is because of the passion and drive of the hardworking people in hundreds of tourism businesses in the north, across accommodation, attractions, food and beverage operations and more. Credit also goes to Tourism Northern Tasmania and the Launceston and Tamar Valley Tourism Association for all the work that they do to support tourism businesses and initiatives in the region. Tasmania produces some of the finest cheese, chocolate, wine, whisky, honey, beef and lamb in the world. We have a growing number of whisky and gin distilleries, cider houses and microbreweries cropping up across Northern Tasmania. To that end, I invite colleagues from all sides of parliament to come and enjoy the highlight of the sitting calendar, Flavours of Tasmania, tomorrow night, 22 October. You won't be disappointed</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  The closure of a 14-bed dementia care unit in Lisarow and a 110-bed aged-care facility in Wyoming is distressing news for families in my New South Wales Central Coast electorate of Dobell. The imminent closure of the Henry Kendall Aged Care facility in Wyoming and the 14-bed dementia unit at the Orchards in Lisarow is unsettling for residents and their carers and families. The Morrison government's failure to meet the demand for home care packages and the shortage of aged-care beds mean those needing residential care, particularly in crisis, may have little or no choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety is shining a light on poor practices in residential aged care. The health and welfare of elderly residents, their families and carers must be paramount. In demanding best practice from aged-care providersâwhich we mustâwe must also demand real action from this government. The Morrison government has failed to fix the crisis in home care packages, failed to give the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission adequate powers to keep residents safe and cut $2 billion in funding from the aged-care system. Those cuts, made by then Treasurer Scott Morrison, have left some residential aged-care providers, many in regional and remote communities, struggling to stay afloat. Without proper funding, more closures are likely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, at least one elderly couple has already been separated by the closure of the dementia unit at the Orchards. The couple purchased a low-care unit in the belief they could move to a high level of care if and when they needed it. Their granddaughter Haley let me know her grandmother had settled into the dementia care unit when her family was informed over the phone that the unit would be closing in October and they'd need to find alternative accommodation for their grandmother. Her grandfather still lives at the Orchards and the family could afford the $500,000 bond to move their grandmother into another facility; however, the distance between the facilities makes visits for the couple very difficult. Haley is very concerned and said, 'We are worried that if my grandfather starts to show the same symptoms we will need to find him a new home too.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of aged-care facilities is a concern, as we have an ageing population on the Central Coast and a shortage of beds, particularly for those living with dementia. Providers need to understand that moving an elderly resident, particularly at this time in their life, is like kicking them out of their own home. The health, relationship, and financial consequences can be devastating for the elderly residents, their families and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak here today as the patron of the Central Coast Dementia Alliance and as someone whose father lived with dementia. This is urgent. It's a crisis. And this government must act now. They need to act urgently and properly care for elderly Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  The JDRF One Walk is an annual event held in cities and regional centres right across Australia to help raise awareness and funds for research into type 1 diabetes. I was pleased to be able to join around 150 locals at the Davistown waterfront recently for the annual JDRF One Walk to help 'turn type 1 into type none'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Australia has invested more than $152 million in research, which will help to improve the day-to-day lives of those who live with type 1 diabetes as well as, we hope, to eventually prevent and cure the condition. The annual JDRF One Walk raises critical funds for clinical research, specifically for trials, employing local researchers in Australia, and accelerating the lab-to-trial stage to allow faster access and greater outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years, I've had the privilege of attending and taking part in the JDRF One Walk on the Central Coast, and every year I've really been struck by the community's determination to raise awareness locally and to help find a cure. And so today I'd really like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of a number of members of the Central Coast community who are able to not only raise awareness of type 1 diabetes but also help raise much-needed funds for critical research in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, the JDRF One Walk on the Central Coast managed to raise more than $40,000, and this would not have been possible without the efforts of those who took part in the walk. I acknowledge Maddison Sewell, who was the top individual fundraiser for the walk this year. She managed to raise, individually, more than $2,200 for the walk, and she was among the top 10 fundraisers in New South Wales. Jaynie Moloney is another fantastic local, who raised an amazing $1,700. She got involved after her son Nate was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She was also part of team Type One-derful, which raised almost $4,000 for the walk. The team from St Joseph's Catholic College raised more than $5,400, and I want to pay tribute to the great efforts of Gemma, Liv and Tilly from the Joey's T1 Team. This is an incredible achievement, and something that these students, their parents and their teachers should be very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This fantastic event would not have been possible without the hard work of the wonderful Margaret Sheridan and Helen Quirk, who hosted this year's walk. I'd like to congratulate you both on another successful year and thank you for your passion, your advocacy and your leadership in making our local community aware of the prevalence of type 1 diabetes. This was highlighted by Margaret's own fundraising efforts of more than $1,500, which is an illustration of her ability to consistently lead by example. I thank all of the local families, schools and businesses across the coast who contributed this year. With your contributions, the Central Coast was the second-largest fundraiser in New South Wales. Thank you to JDRF Australia for their continued efforts in researching type 1 diabetes, in trying to turn 'type 1 into type none' and dramatically improving the lives of thousands right across Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to move the motion circulated in my name, recognising that social harmony is vital for the continuation of a successful Australian democracy. The south side of Brisbane is particularly diverse. There are many cultures, many ethnicities and many religions. Happily, for the most part my community is a thriving melting pot and the epitome of social harmony. Sadly, there are people both in the community and in this very parliament who want to destroy the social harmony that exists in our communities. For some time now, gutless, nasty individuals have targeted religious minorities across Australia. I would suggest that these individuals are encouraged by politicians, commentators and others with a public platform who want to destroy the social cohesion that we are so proud of in my communityâin fact, in every community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some recent incidents have shaken the south side to its core and will have a lasting impact on those involved. The exposure draft of the Morrison government's religious freedom bill purports to provide freedom for individuals to manifest their religious belief and practice in their speech and in their teaching within the confines of the law. So far, the exposure draft has received much criticism from almost everyone, from business groups right through to religious bodies. We'll need to wait and see what the Morrison government eventually settles on in the final bill, but one thing is certain: the bill in its current form does not provide any protections from vilification or even violence based on a person's religious belief, the very thing that my community wants and needs. The dangerous physical attacks experienced recently by people of Muslim faith in my community were likely seeded in religious vilification and incitement of hatred going unchecked. I know that my good friend Ed Husic has mentioned that in parliament as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cowardly online warriors are spraying their bile 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and our young people are faced with this all the time. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner in a research study found that 53 per cent of Australian youth have witnessed anti-Muslim harmful content online. These are young Australians aged between 12 and 17âjust children. Imagine what impact this has on these kids. Online vilification and incitement of hatred is the seed that culminates in hate crime. Hate breeds harm and often even worse. Online vilification and incitement of hatred has real-world consequences. It emboldens those susceptible to that rhetoric to go out and harm real people. Sadly, attacks on Australian citizens are more likely to be directed against Muslim women because of their modest clothing choices, often when they're accompanied by their children. Most victims of these cowardly attacks do not report them to the police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Islamophobia is the most prolific online vilification, according to the eSafety Commissioner, but other religious people such as those of the Jewish faith and Christians are also targeted online. If we're to protect religious freedom in Australia, it's core to that freedom that individuals are free to manifest their faith and belief without fear of vilification or violence to themselves or to their family. For my community on the south side of Brisbane, it is vitally important that we do not lose the social harmony we've worked so hard to achieve over the last few decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Islamic community is a crucial part of that fabric on Brisbane's south side. They're always ready to support and help those who are most vulnerable. Here are just a couple of examples of their selfless generosity. They've donated funds for swimmers with down syndrome to compete in the Down Syndrome World Swimming Championships overseas. They've donated bales of hay for animals in drought-affected parts of Queensland. They've fundraised and donated drinking water to the residents of Stanthorpe. They've supplied snack packs for Brothers in Need, as well as hot food and sleeping bags for the homeless in Brisbane. Hopefully, it won't be necessary next month, but, if it doesn't rain, they'll also deliver hay and water to Stanthorpe again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people who are experiencing vilification in our community. They're generous. They're warm-hearted. They're community-minded people who won't walk past a person in need without reaching out and offering support. In fact, their faith demands it of them. They're the first to support and celebrate our diverse and multifaith community, they're the first to volunteer in times of disaster and they're the first to be vilified when it's convenient for commentators and politicians who want to stir up fear and division for their own selfish political or media games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're our friends, and they're our neighbours. They're my friends and they're my neighbours. I call on the Morrison government to protect this community and all religious communities at risk of endangerment from vilification and incitement of hatred and violence. I ask all the Abrahamic faiths and other religions to join me in this cause.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  Thank you to the member for Moreton for bringing forward this debate. Violence, vilification and discrimination can never be allowed to occur, and it's important that we recognise and verbalise this important statement regularly in this House for all Australians to see and hear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of Bennelong for many reasons. We are a bright, innovative and friendly electorate, with an exciting future to look forward to. But perhaps the thing I am most proud of is our multicultural community. Since the fifties Bennelong has been a melting pot, welcoming Italians, Armenians, Indians, Chinese, Koreans and many other people from around the planet. Communities from across the globe have come to Bennelong and made a permanent home, combining the great benefits of our two cultures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strong diversity is instantly apparent to any visitor to Bennelong. It can even be quantified, thanks to the last census. Nearly 22 per cent of all residents speak either Cantonese or Mandarin; a further 9,000 residents speak Korean; just under 3,000 speak Italian, and a similar number speak Arabic; and there are also high levels of Armenian and Farsi spoken. In total, over 51 per cent of homes in Bennelong speak a language other than English at home. Each of these communities has brought their culture with them, obviously, but they have also shared their cultures with the existing community. As a result, we have a wholesome community made richer by the cultures that make it up. We eat with Chinese and Korean diners, we play chess with Armenian masters, we play sport with Indian teammates and we laugh and live together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our greatest strength is our diversity. I hope our community can be an example to others, because there are places in Australia where multiculturalism has not yet led to harmony. Bennelong shows how, by sharing our lives and our communities with others, the whole community benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not been without our troubles, of course. Back in 2014 there was a spate of assaults in Eastwood, many suspected to be as a result of the victims' cultural backgrounds. In discussions with leaders from the Chinese and Korean communities, my friends Hugh Lee and Jason Koh explained to me that there was often a stigma amongst certain cultures against reporting being the victim of a crime; people being held back by language or even issues of saving face. Eastwood police were aware of the problem, but struggling to cross the cultural divide. As a result, I was delighted to work closely with the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong and the Korean Chamber of Commerce, as well as the state member, Victor Dominello, to secure $200,000 in federal grants for the City of Ryde for the installation of CCTV cameras in some of the underlit parks and car parks of Eastwood. Reports of assaults have gone down in these areas. Indeed, one park is where I launched my campaign just a few months ago, right in the cultural heart of Bennelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cameras and law enforcement are all well and good, but in order to reduce the violence felt by minorities we require something more: a change in ourselves. We need to be better people, sympathetic and open. Everyone has a context and we must try to understand this background before we judge their situation or their actions. Most importantly, we must call out abuse. As policymakers and leaders of this nation it is our responsibility to ensure that racism and ignorance do not combine again. That starts by identifying and rejecting them, something we must do with full voice and full conviction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you again to the member for Moretonâwho seems to be getting a head start on the Movember race that we often engage in!âfor raising this issue today. His game of tennis needs some improvement, too! Bringing cohesion to Australia is the most important thing we do in this place, and if we can stop discrimination we will set this country up for a strong, united and exciting future. I'm looking forward to our next game!</span>

I'm proud to represent the electorate of Werriwa for many reasons. Chief amongst them is its strong, diverse multicultural community. We recognise it, we celebrate it and we're stronger for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the most successful multicultural nation on earth. Our migration and settlement program is an exemplar and is looked to by other nations as world's best practice, and rightly so. But it needs to stay that way. Not a week goes by when I am not witness to the best of multicultural Australia in my electorate, either in my public capacity or my private capacity, whether at a cultural festival or citizenship ceremony or at one of the many shops, and in shopkeepers that are neighbours to my electorate office or in the diverse faces in childcare centres and schools in our community. A mark of multicultural Australia's success is that for the vast majority of us it is so unremarkable. It is important to ensure that it remains so and that people are safe in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Werriwa is a proud community of many different cultures and many different backgrounds, and it is strong for exactly that reason. We understand and welcome all the cultures that have made this country the great place it is today. It is a value driven community, not only of the people who live there but of the organisations that work for the people of Werriwa. Just yesterday, I was present at the bicentennial celebration service for St Luke's Anglican Church in Liverpool. A Francis Greenway designed church, it has been holding services on the same site for 200 years. Reverend Stuart Pearson led the service in front of the New South Wales Governor, the Hon. Margaret Beazley; the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Davies; and the Bishop of Georges River, Reverend Lin. The service was most definitely reflective of our multicultural community, acknowledging the traditional owners as well as reflecting 19 different language groups within the congregation when the Bible verse John 3:16 was recited in different languages, from Auslan to Nepalese and Cantonese, as well as Arabic, Italian, French, Vietnamese and many more. As Councillor Charishma Kaliyanda said, it represented our diversity and unity, as many voices use the same words to provide the same message of love and respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation that lives and breathes those values is Al-Muntada, the Iraqi Australian University Graduates Forum. Al-Muntada works across south-west Sydney, including in my seat of Werriwa, to provide cultural and educational harmony. Since 2008, it has run projects, held activities and events that foster cultural exchange between the local Iraqi community and the wider Australian community. Amongst those most Australians value is the recognition of the transformative nature of education as well as the love of song and dance in the defence of human rights. The group includes members from all of Iraq's major cultures, religions and denominationsâSunni, Shia, Christian, Mandaean, Kurdish, Arabic and Assyrian. They embody both the rich depth of the history and culture of their Iraqi heritage and the harmonious multicultural values of their Australian homeland. Each year, they hold the Shanasheel Iraqi Cultural Festival at the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre. Last year's keynote speech was from orthopaedic surgeon and former asylum seeker Dr Munjed Al Muderis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Al Muderis's story is like so many great Australian migrant stories, one of someone who has come to this country with nothing but the clothes on his back and has built a prosperous and successful life in the country that has given them a second chance. Dr Al Muderis fled Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a young surgeon after refusing to mutilate the ears of army deserters. After reaching Australia by boat, via Indonesia and Malaysia, he was kept in the Curtin detention centre, including a stint in solitary confinement. Despite this, after being released he continued his career in medicine, becoming a pioneer and a world leader in developing a new method for the implanting of prosthetic limbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should embrace and value the contribution of all our community, wherever they come from. This is what brings us together. Everyone should feel safe and be safe and have the opportunity to live together peacefully. It is better for all us when this happens.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Moreton for moving his motion. The member raises this motion at a time when there's been a real increase in the rise of racist violence in our community and a motion such as this is most important. Over time, in our country, we've seen an erosion in tolerance. As parliamentarians we have a duty to stand up and decry racial and religious vilification where it occurs. We must remind Australians of the values that bind us together as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to provide a particularly personal perspective as a Jewish Australian. In the last year, Australia has witnessed a 60 per cent increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Long discredited anti-Semitic ideas are now being given credence by the far Left and the far Right, and, with social media unchallenged, anti-Semitic ideas spread quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election campaign seemed to be a lightning rod for these activities. During the election, I was one of several candidates from all parties who had posters defaced by people trying to intimidate me by sending a message of hate. First, it was swastikas and Hitler moustaches on my posters in a street of Normanhurst. Then, my campaign office, private property, was plastered with antipodean resistance stickers. And, finally, the photo on my campaign office was painted over with dollar signs. The Treasurer experienced similar attacks when his posters were daubed with dollar signs and other anti-Semitic messages. That's not because he's Treasurer; it's because, like me, he's Jewish and, like me, he's been targeted by the merchants of hate. The dollar signs refer to the old anti-Semitic lies of an international Jewish banking conspiracy. These sentiments were used by those who have sought to spread the hatred of Jews for centuries. I've been involved in politics for 27 years, but I've never seen anything like this before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These weren't isolated incidents. A few weeks earlier, a restaurant in Epping, just outside my constituency, was plastered with anti-Semitic slogans, including 'Watch out Jews' and 'Kill Jews'. Vicious emails were also distributed about the former member for Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, which falsely claimed she had been disqualified from the election because as a Jew she was in breach of section 44.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These acts didn't stop or start with the election. In September last year, the Labor member for Eden-Monaro, a prominent supporter of Israel and the Jewish community, had neo-Nazi stickers and a bag of pig entrails thrown at his office. The Treasurer continues to be harassed by what is nothing more than an anti-Semitic legal action questioning his right to sit in this place. But none of this compares to the most appalling incidents, which occurred in two public schools in Melbourne. A 12-year-old Jewish boy was forced to get down on his knees and kiss the shoes of a Muslim classmate. The boy had been bullied into this act, with older students threatening violence if he didn't comply with their request. He was also sent texts that threatened he'd be slaughtered and that asked if he thought about suicide. And a five-year-old boy was so taunted by other children in the bathroom for being a Jew and being circumcised that he wet himself rather than going to the toilet. When this type of hatred is appearing in our children, we should be deeply concerned about the future of this country. As Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of the Commonwealth, has written, 'The hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, a Hindu temple in Regents Park was vandalised. Holy statues were strewn across the floor, instruments broken and the room was smeared with paint. The vandals didn't steal anything; they wanted to destroy the house of worship. Near Wollongong in April, a Muslim family had gathered at a lookout for a picnic and a man began screaming anti-Islamic sentiments at them. He proceeded to get in his car and drive around them doing burnouts on the grass where they'd set up, just so he could intimidate them. This is absolutely un-Australian, but unfortunately it's becoming increasingly common.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day after the Christchurch terror attack, I went to visit the Imam Hasan centre, a mosque at Annangrove in my electorate. I told the congregants I knew they were scared and I knew exactly how they felt, because the recent synagogue shootings in the United States had made me feel exactly the same way when I attended my synagogue. I came home and I called Minister Coleman and the Prime Minister and lobbied for increased funding so that people of faith, particularly religious minorities, can attend houses of worship and other places of communal gathering in safety. I'm pleased the government responded with a $55 million increase in the Safer Communities Fund, putting in place long-needed security infrastructure in communal buildings for a range of faiths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent speech to the Thomas More Society, I noted the rise in discrimination against Christians. The rise in religious discrimination is the reason why the government is preparing a religious discrimination act. Australia is the most successful multicultural country on earth. Our differences are what make us strong and are what make us interesting. Governments can provide laws and funding, but only individual citizens can create that shared space for us to live together in harmony. That is a national project worth pursuing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  Can I start by commending the members for Moreton and Bonner for putting forward this motion to the House and also to my colleagues who have spoken here today on both sides, particularly the member for Berowra for sharing his own experiences of religious discrimination, religious hatred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend I heard a wonderful saying: 'Unity does not start with a million people; it starts with just two.' And in the case of today it starts with a handful of us coming together to speak on this motion. This motion deals explicitly with vilification of individuals and groups of religious faith. Just to give some examples of that over the past few years, in my home state of Western Australia in 2010 we had two members of Combat 18 shoot a mosque in Perth. In 2014 a pig's head was left at the door of a Perth mosque. In 2015 another mosque was also vandalised with a pig's head. Later that year, that mosque had 'white power' graffitied on its walls. In 2016 a car exploded outside a Perth mosque with a fire bomb. And in 2018 another Perth mosque was fire bombed. These kinds of incidents may be few and far betweenâalthough they are becoming more and more regular and more and more prevalentâbut these kinds of violent incidents begin with rhetoric, they begin with language and they begin with behaviour that normalises everyday acts of vilification and discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Office of the e-Safety Commissioner reported that 53 per cent of Australian youth have witnessed anti-Muslim harmful content online. It's also reported that 78 per cent of in-person attacks were against Muslim women. These were attacks in the presence of their children, where their children were also targetedâattacks of hatred in public. And 96 per cent of targeted women were Muslim women who are visibly Muslim because they wear the hijab. The Islamophobia Register is soon to release its second report but in its first report painted a very bleak picture of the rise of Islamophobia and religious discrimination here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had rather, I guess, a lot of experience in talking to people who are 'formers'âwho have left violent extremism in various iterations and various forms, from former violent jihadists to former IRA and, indeed, former white supremacists. I have to say this, of all dozens of formers that I have met none of them have ever left the movement because they were presented with a fact sheet. No white supremacist ever left white suprematism behind because somebody gave them a report on how great multiculturalism is for our economy or for our society. Indeed, everyone that I have met who left a hate movement left because of a personal connection with an individual or a group who they had perceived to be the enemy. That's why it's so important that we come together. It's why it's so important that we come together to speak out against hatred, to speak out against vilification, but also to recognise, as the member for Berowra said, that hatred against one group doesn't end there. Often that hatred spreads to a whole range of other groups as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the fact that, as I say, no individual has ever changed their world view because of a fact sheet, we can do more by setting moral and legal standards as an important step to acknowledging that, in this country, in Australia, we have no tolerance for hatred, we have no tolerance for vilification and we have no tolerance for people who would target individuals of religious minorities because of their faith, particularly those who are most vulnerable to targeting, particularly Muslim women who wear the hijab, men who wear religious dress in any form, andâas the member for Berowra so eloquently talked aboutâcases involving children. We do not want our children to be targeted as well. Once again, I commend all members of the chamber today for speaking on this very important topic.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I want to thank my good friend the member for Moreton for bringing this motion to the House, because both of us represent communities that have a large multicultural component to them. In Logan there are some 217 different cultures represented, and I suspect the member for Moreton's electorate wouldn't be too many fewer than that. It would be pretty close. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It tells a story, as the previous speakers have on this motion, of the wonderful success story that is Australia. It's the wonderful success story of a multicultural society that is the envy of the world. I reflect on that as somebody whose parents came out from Europe in the mid-sixties. But I also reflect on that in the context of the electorate that I represent. At first, it was largely settled by German immigrants back in the 1860s. So it's not just that large flow of migrants to Australia after World War II and in the subsequent years; it's also a story that goes back well over 100 years, with migrants coming to this countryâwhether they were the Chinese for the gold rush or the Germans, particularly, escaping persecution in Germany at that time for religious beliefsâto seek a new and better life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be very proud as a nation of our success in this area, because it's through the shared experiences that our migrants have brought to this country that we have built the country we have today. It is their ingenuity, their hard work and their willingness to get involved in our community which have created the communities that we live in today. Whether they are from European backgrounds, or have an Asian cultural heritage or a Middle Eastern cultural heritage, all those people bring something to the fabric of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I think it's incredibly disappointing that we see people in our communities who are prepared to vilify and denigrate those with a different cultural background. It brings nothing to our society or to strengthening our communities to denigrate somebody else because of their cultural beliefs or views. It fails to recognise the facts about what these people bring to our society. I'm pleased to say that in my electorate, unlike some of the stories we've heard from others, that has been a rare occurrence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at some of the contributions by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the floods we had several years ago, and the work that they did to get out into the community and support flood victims by cleaning up their houses, making sure that they were fed and helping to restore their property and their lives, and what was really satisfying to see was that they worked hand in hand with the Christian community groups to do those things. It was not, 'Oh, the Christians are over here, and we're Muslim, so we're over here.' All of those community groups came together to support people in our community who were going through a very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local Islamic community group, particularly the mosque at Eagleby, was traumatised by what happened in Christchurch. In speaking to them, I made it very clear that they had my support, that I did not for one minute support what happened over there and that it was not my view of how our community worked and operated. Those at the mosque at Eaglebyâquietly, I might addâdo lots of little things in our community that help to strengthen it. It's interesting: the design of the mosque there is not a traditional mosque design. When driving past, most people wouldn't know that we had a mosque in Eagleby. But they get out and are involved quietly in the community, just making it a stronger and better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's people from all walks and all cultures who have built this country, and we should be extraordinarily proud of them. We should continue to call out, as this motion has done, those who seek to vilify and denigrate the people who have made this country what it is today.</span>

Unfortunately, in recent times, many Australians haven't had the ability to enjoy those freedoms following events such as the Islamophobic attack at the mosque in Christchurch and the anti-Semitic attack on Jewish worshippers in a synagogue in Germany. These things have really become a point of contention in many areas of the community. It is these hate-filled crimes which have motivated white supremacist ideology on our shores, including the repeated attacks on the Holland Park mosque in Brisbaneâand I thank the member for Moreton for bringing this motion to our attention. Only last week, an incident was reported of a man carrying a machete walking towards a congregation of worshippers at that very mosque. Luckily, in that instance, neighbours of the mosque brought to the group's attention what this fellow was up to, and as a consequence he departed. Nevertheless, that would have left people pretty shakenâto think that someone was trying to enter a mosque with a machete. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry last year found that there had been a 60 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the preceding 12 months. Similarly, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has noted that 53 per cent of youth in Australia have witnessed anti-Muslim content online. It's just reprehensible to think that this is occurring on our watch. In social policy terms, the impacts are grave, with research indicating that such behaviour creates an environment which cultivates discrimination and vilification, normalises negative attitudes and, moreover, is linked to extremism, such as that we witnessed in Christchurch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this extent, the Islamophobia Register has found that discrimination facing our community comes in the form of bullying at schools; personal attacks, including verbal insults; vandalising of buildings with graffiti; and targeting religious dress. What is more distressing, quite frankly, is that women are the main targets of personal attacks based on religion and that almost half of all personal attacks that have occurred on women have occurred in public and crowded places. That should be a concern to all of us. It is these statistics which reinforce our collective need to protect religious communities and minorities at risk of danger from incitement of hatred and violence. We must stand united and stand against hatred. Hatred stands in stark contrast to the values we all subscribe to.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who mask freedom of speech as a form of protecting against racism, let me say to members that freedom of speech does not and should not ever equate to the freedom to spread intolerance and division in our community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  The motion asks the House to recognise that 'there is no legislative protection against vilification and incitement to hatred and/or violence based on a person's religion or religious belief'. That is, of course, incorrect. All Australian governments are responsible for protecting Australians from incitement to hatred or violence. At the Commonwealth level, we do this through the Criminal Code. Sections 80.2A and 80.2B make it an offence to urge the use of violence or force against religious groups or their members, punishable by up to seven years imprisonment. These penalties reflect that incitement to hatred and violence is a very serious criminal matter. Other jurisdictions also make incitement to hatred or violence against religious groups a criminal offence. New South Wales, Queensland, ACT and my home state of Victoria all have criminal offences relating to the incitement of violence against religious groups, but the maximum penalties in those jurisdictions are lower than the penalties that apply under the Commonwealth law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about protecting the ability of religious communities to live in accordance with their faith. A central plank in the government's efforts to protect Australia's religious communities is our Religious Discrimination Bill. That bill will introduce laws at the Commonwealth level that, for the first time, protect Australians from discrimination on the basis of their religious beliefs or activities. The bill will fill an obvious gap in Australia's human rights laws. It will protect Australians from religious discrimination in the same way they are protected from discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race or disability. For example, if it's passed, that bill would, for the first time, make it unlawful for a Jewish man in Victoria to be turned away by a taxi because of his faith, or a Muslim woman in New South Wales to be refused service at a shop because she is wearing a hijab.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also protects the ability of religious communities to say what they believe. The bill simply says that Australians should not face a discrimination lawsuit just for saying what they believe. All Australians should be free to live in accordance with their faith, and to share that faith that others, without being subject to lawsuits because others find the faith offensive. Critically, the bill also balances this protection by putting in place very clear safeguards which ensure that there are no protections for speech that is malicious, that harasses or vilifies people, or that incites violence or hatred. This is a balanced, straightforward safeguard that protects all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains protections for religious bodies. Very often it is our religious institutions that are the central pillars of Australian religious communities. For example, the synagogue might be the heart of a Jewish community, and an Islamic community might be built around a mosque. Our Religious Discrimination Bill protects those institutions by making clear that, for the purposes of the bill, they do not discriminate on the grounds of religious belief or activity by acting in accordance with their faith. So I can say that what the motion asks the House to recognise is definitely incorrect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me immense pleasure to rise today to speak on this motion and to mark National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, which was observed on 14 September 2019. Australia has always played a leading and vital role in peacekeeping missions around the world, none more so than that leading 22 nations in the deployment of the International Force East Timor, the peacemaking task force that went to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis between 1999 and 2000. The 20th anniversary of that significant deployment to Timor-Leste was observed on 14 September this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no greater honour than to serve your country. The sacrifices Australian men and women make for our country are truly remarkableâin some cases the ultimate sacrifice. All too often they are away from loved ones for long periods of time, missing birthdays, anniversaries, family gatherings and so on. Imagine having to say goodbye to loved onesâyour wife, husband, partner, children, parents and friendsâevery three, six or 12 months, not knowing whether you'll actually see them again or whether they will see you. That's what we're asking our men and our women in our armed forces and their families to do, and I would like everyone in this chamber just to pause and think about that for a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 5,000 Australian personnel contributed to the International Force East Timor, including the former Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. To say things were unstable in the region at the time is an absolute understatement. Following the announcement of the referendum result on 4 September 1999, violent and deadly clashes instigated by anti-independence militias broke out. Many East Timorese were killed. An estimated 500,000 were displaced and around half fled the territory. Australia, under the leadership of former Prime Minister John Howard, could not sit back and watch this crisis unfold on our doorstep. And I have to say that, as a member of the government of that time, it was great to see, as we do in many of these types of situations, the very strong bipartisan support we had in dealing with that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not get into the nitty-gritty aspects of the mission, but on 28 February 2000 International Force East Timor handed over command of military operations to the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor, which provided an interim civil administration and oversaw the peacekeeping mission until the country's independence on 20 May 2002. The country remains fragile, and political rivalries extending back into its guerrilla past have required the help of the Australian Army again in 2006 and 2009, but it certainly has a bright future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, during the Australian deployment four Australian soldiers lost their lives. However, none of these deaths were due to enemy actions. Many also came back home very different people after witnessing horrors and atrocities we simply can't fathom. Sadly, this is an all-too-familiar story for many of our veterans that return home from active service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to personally thank all of those personnel for their sacrifice and their serviceâall of those who served in peacekeeping operations in the past and those currently serving in the UN Truce Supervision Organization, the UN Mission in South Sudan, the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and the UN Disengagement Observer Force. Let me tell you that serving in these operations, unless you've actually been over there and witnessed yourself what happens at the time, is very hard to imagine. There's a huge amount of pride that goes with serving and contributing something positive to what was the re-establishment of Timor-Leste as a nation. We've seen the same thing happening in many other areas where our troops have gone in as peacekeepers, and I think we should always be very mindful and respectful of the contribution and the sacrifices that they make willingly. It is a sacrifice the burden of which is in many ways also carried by their families. I have to say to them all: you are the real, true heroes in my eyes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I second the motion, and commend the member for Leichardt for moving it. This year, 14 September marked National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, and 20 September, of course, marked the 20th anniversary of the deployment of the International Force East Timor, INTERFET, the peacekeeping force that went to Timor Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis that was engulfing that place. It's wonderful to have the opportunity to talk about the outstanding contribution of Australians and all those who've served and continue to serve in international peacekeeping operations, as well as the families who support them. They are heroes as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important that we recognise that approximately 65,000 servicemen and women have been involved in over 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide on behalf of our country since 1947. There are still some serving currently in UN peacekeeping operations. Since Australia has been involved, there have been 70 years of service to the international community. Tragically, we've seen the loss of life and we've seen others come home, as the member for Leichhardt said, never to be the same again. Australian peacekeepers have served in some of the most challenging environments around the world, involving operations in places such as Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, Timor Leste, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bougainville and others. Peacekeeping operations often involve, primarily, our Defence Force, but there are also Australians from various police forces around the country, and civilians who are making contributions of a humanitarian and community development nature. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, 20 September marked the 20th anniversary of INTERFET, a multinational peacekeeping task force mandated by the United Nations to address the humanitarian and security situation in Timor Leste, which had deterioratedâwe recall the pictures we saw on TV. It was also the first time Australia led a major international coalition. Apart from the response of the Prime Minister, John Howard, to the Port Arthur tragedy, I thought that East Timor was probably close to one of the finest things he did as Prime Minister. I say that in a bipartisan way. I thought he did a tremendous job in that regard. I also want to commend Major General Peter Cosgrove of the Australian Army, who went on to become the Chief of the Defence Force and a distinguished Governor-General of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are a range of commemorative activities across the country, and in Dili there were government ministersâas well as, I understand, my opposition colleague the member for Solomon and Timor Leste veteran, Luke Goslingâwho attended. On 21 September I attended a special Ipswich RSL Sub Branch INTERFET commemorative service at the Ipswich Memorial Gardens, beside the hall, in my electorate. I laid a wreath to honour all those who served in Timor Leste. It was a privilege to meet a number of local INTERFET and Timor veterans and to reflect on the outstanding contribution they made to Timor Leste's success today. It's an independent, democratic and economically sustainable nation, but I agree with the member for Leichhardt: there are challenges that that small country faces. The speeches in Ipswich reminded those present of the peacekeeping operations and the challengesâand even risksâthat were there. It was the right thing to do at the time. It was deeply supported by the Australian public and deeply appreciated by the overwhelming majority of people in Timor Leste. In recent times, peacekeeping has been an important part of Australia's defence posture. Indeed, we still have a number of service personnel deployed in peacekeeping operations around the world, and the things we learned in Timor Leste have been applied. All of us were reminded of this at the recent event in Ipswich. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial on Anzac Parade here in Canberra was inaugurated in 2017 to commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australians who served in peacekeeping or peacekeeping missions around the world. I know that my colleague the member for Bean, Dave Smith, represented federal Laborâcertainly on my behalfâhere in Canberra at the Australian Peacekeeping Day commemoration held at the memorial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This memorial and these events are an important chapter in our Anzac history. Sadly, some former Australian peacekeepers have felt they've been forgotten and their service has not been properly recognised. I hope today they don't feel that. In the national parliament we are showing our gratitude and our support to let them know they've made an invaluable contribution to our national security and the security of our country. We salute them. It's vital that they know we honour them, we understand the sacrifices they've made and we hope their sacrifice is getting the recognition it deserves. I thank the member for the motion and commend it to the chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONNELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  Let me start with a quote from first-century theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine, who said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always been firmly of a mind that the strong should help the weak, that those who are prosperous should help those who are poor. In fact, we have a moral obligation to support those for whom violence and poverty is the daily norm. As a young Australian Army officer I had the wonderful opportunity to serve as a platoon commander in East Timor. Here, Australia led the United Nations effort to end the bloodshed and so enable the birth of a new sovereign state, Timor-Leste. Later, as a captain and second in command of the rifle Australian infantry company, I had the opportunity to be one of the first on the deployment to the Solomon Islands, where we conducted cordon and search operations, collected criminals and thousands of weapons, and restored peace to our Pacific neighbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than 70 years Australian peacekeepers have playedâand they continue to playâan important role in advancing peace around the globe. An estimated 65,000 service men and women have been involved in 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide since 1947. And since 1964, along with members of the ADF, members of Australia's police service have joined peacekeeping operations internationally. On 14 September each year, National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, we honour the courage and professionalism of Australian servicemen, servicewomen and police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the first Australian peacekeepers worked as unarmed military observers, over time the nature of peacekeeping operations has evolved to include the management of more complex and volatile environments. These have ranged from operations as military observers, providing logistical support and monitoring ceasefires, to landmine clearance operations, and also supporting democratic elections and providing policing support and humanitarian aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian peacekeepers have often served in hostile and volatile environments, including operations in Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, East Timor, Cambodia, Rwanda and Bougainville. This year also marked, as we heard earlier, the 20th anniversary of the INTERFET mission, the peacemaking task force that went to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis in 1999-2000. At the time, the INTERFET mission was the largest single Australian deployment since the Second World War. To mark this important time in our history, veterans who put boots on the ground between 1999 and 2000 in Timor-Leste participated in a commemorative ceremony at the Palacio do Governo, which was followed by an official parade of remembrance to the Dili Convention Centre. INTERFET commander and former Governor-General of Australia Sir Peter Cosgrove was one of those who attended. His role crossed between the lines of soldier and diplomat, and under great pressure he made decisions that have helped to shape history. His leadership during INTERFET was highly and widely respected and is a testament to all that he has achieved since, moving on to become Chief of Army, Chief of the Defence Force and, of course, Governor-General of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, 16 Australians have died serving as peacekeepers, and their names are listed on the walls at the Australian War Memorial. It's also important to remember today those deployed in peacekeeping operations right now around the world, including in South Sudan, the Middle East and Cyprus. The international community is no doubt also thankful for the valuable service of our peacekeepers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look ahead, we should recognise that next month we commemorate Remembrance Day. This is the day we all acknowledge the almost two million Australians who have served and still serve in the defence of our nation. I encourage everyone to get along to their local Remembrance Day ceremony and pause for a moment's silence. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  Today we acknowledge, recognise and commemorate the event of 20 September 2019âthe 20th anniversary of the deployment of the International Force East Timor, INTERFET, the peacekeeping task force that came to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis from 1999 to 2000. It followed National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, 14 September 2019, six days earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These days are important and must be remembered as part of our national calendar because they speak not just to the legacy and the memory of our peacekeepers but to the character and the objectives of this country itself. Australia has always sought to be a peaceful nation and to bring, as part of a community of nations, stability and peace for humanity. For more than 70 years, Australian peacekeepers have playedâand they continue to playâa critical role in Australia and beyond our shores to assist that effort. We've had an estimated 65,000 service men and women who've been involved in over 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide since 1947. Behind each one of those peacekeepers have been human stories and an ambition for the type of world that we want to be. Since 1964, along with members of the ADF, members of Australia's police services have also served in peacekeeping operations around the world, aiding and assisting those in situations of need and conflict to bring about the peace that we seek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had peacekeepers often operating in very hostile environments, and, tragically, 16 have been killed in pursuit of their mission. Their memories, their names, their legacy and their contribution to our great nation and the world are recognised at the Australian War Memorial. Our peacekeepers haven't just stayed in safety or ease; they've seen the realisation of what they want to give to the world in often hostile and volatile environments, including operations in Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, East Timor, Cambodia, Rwanda and Bougainville. We must always acknowledge their sacrifice, because, when you think about the strength and resilience of our great country, it comes not from ease or from circumstances that we often would wish for ourselves but on the backs and the might and the sacrifice of those who make a greater contribution. That's why the acknowledgement of our peacekeepersâparticularly this year, the 20th anniversary of the INTERFET missionâis so critical. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on our borders and beyond our shores, a new nation faced serious threats and a humanitarian and security crisis. Every country in those situations faces choices. Yes, they face a choice about the impact it might have on themselves, but they also face a choice about what they can do to strengthen the bonds between a country and its internal resilience, and to show their humanity and humanitarianism for our allies. That's why we engaged to support peacekeeping operations, with 5,500 of our peacekeepers deployed in 1999. The legacy of their contribution continues today in the success of the ongoing journey of the country of Timor-Leste. We must never forget that there are people who stood tall but also fell. When we come to Remembrance Day, it's time to remember their legacy and their contribution as part of the ongoing story of our great nation. Lest we forget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's with some frustration I rise to speak yet again about the failure of the government to adequately support the incredibly important Home Care Packages Program. Home care packages play a really important role in ageing. They allow people to stay home as they age, whether they need a small amount of support on level 1 or a great deal of support on level 4.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, with the release of the latest data on home care packages, it appears that the fate of many older Australians is sealed when it comes to receiving the support they need to age with dignity in their homes. Not long ago I spoke about a woman in my electorate of Parramatta, Mary Seeward, who died before she received approval for a level 4 home care package after waiting for many, many months. After speaking about Mary, a number of my constituents called to relay their own family stories about their issues with My Aged Care. One person's mother had been assessed in March and had still not heard anything back in August. He waited 5Â½ hours on the phone to speak to My Aged Care before he gave up. Another man had been waiting for the assessment of his needs for My Aged Care. After prompting from our office, the assessment was finalised, but he still has to wait for three to six months for a level 1 package and nine to 12 months for the package that he requires, which is a level 2.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the population is ageing. There are more than 18,000 people aged over 65 in my electorate alone, but on this government's watch the home care package waiting list has increased from 88,000 people to 120,000 people. This just isn't good enough. There are 72,000 older Australians on the waiting list who have absolutely no home care package at all. These are real people waiting, sometimes for years, worried and distraught about their future and the condition of their health. Forty-two per cent of people are waiting for level 2 funding, but one in six people are waiting for level 4. These are real people with chronic conditions and in many cases their needs are time sensitive, such as for my constituent Mary, who has now passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the home care model is the best approach for aged care, both economically and socially. What is best for the older person is often the most affordable option for the taxpayer. It just kind of works. Home care allows a person to stay connected to their neighbourhood and their family home with all its memories, to retain connection to their much-loved pets and to keep their independence. For the family, it eases carer responsibility, and for people who are already struggling to balance their work and home life it's essential. And, conveniently, it is the most economically sustainable model for government, as it keeps people from going into nursing homes prematurely and helps prevent the visit to the emergency department. With that in mind, it is incomprehensible that almost 120,000 people are still waiting for their home care packages to be approved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a no-brainer. If you manage the program well, everybody wins. Yet the government is idle, standing by while this incredibly important program fails so many of our older neighbours. The unbelievably long waiting list for home care packages is symptomatic of a deeper crisis of underresourcing. It is a system collapsing before our eyes. This month, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reported the findings of a study of almost 5,000 aged-care staff, and what they had to say should be of great concern to everybody in this House: 81 per cent of workers said they did not have the time to do the tasks they are required to do, and they admitted that they are so stretched they're cutting corners and not giving the elderly people the help they deserve, leading to more residents being left unshowered, rushed during meals or placed at the risk of serious injury; and 67 per cent of home care workers reported an increase in complex needs, including more people with dementia. This is a growing need, and this government is failing to address it. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is responsible for billions of dollars of cuts to the aged-care sector in the past five yearsâ$1.2 billion cut from aged care in his first budget as Treasurer, backing in the $500 million cut in the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of the growing needs of an ageing population, there is both a challenge and an opportunity for our nation. Aged care is not even a cabinet portfolio. There is no holistic, whole-of-government approach to aged care. In addition to underresourcing, blowouts in waiting times and funding cuts, there is a labour crisis, which has only been made worse by the government's cuts to TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the plan? Waiting times now are ridiculous, and a third of aged-care workers plan to leave the industry in the next five years. It's going to get worse. There will be more people in care and fewer people to serve them. Scott Morrison has no plan now and he has no plan for the future. If he doesn't think there's a problem then he's seriously out of touch. He needs to act and he needs to act now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  In moving this motion, the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta, referred to her frustration. I can understand and respect that, because an elected member of parliament who stands at the podium here or in the chamber does so because they seek to pursue the best interests of the community that they represent and, as part of that, to make sure that we are providing the support services to people when they are at the most vulnerable stages of life. That's what this government has been doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The frustration that I and other government members feel is that, after committing billions of dollars towards extra home care packages, as we have, including in the last budget, to make sure that all senior Australians at that vulnerable stage of life get the support and care they need, we come into this chamber and have an opposition member move a motion such as this, when at the last election she ran on a platform of providing exactly 0.0 dollars for extra home care packages in Australia. Let's think about that. This goes to an issue of trust. When it comes down to who Australians trust to provide the support and assistance they need, we know it isn't the opposition that Australians trust. This is not a partisan attack, but it is a criticism of the honesty that sits behind this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done so much to reform aged care and provide the support and assistance that people need at the different gradations of health and wellbeing associated with their ageing. We've made sure that people are in a situation where there is sufficient funding to make sure that people can get aged-care places. That is particularly challenging because the number of people who are staying in their homes is growing and they are staying there for longer periods. Those who are going into residential aged care need support at a more acute level, particularly around issues such as the rising rates of dementia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons that people are able to stay in their homes longerâit is not just out of wish or ambitionâis that the taxpayer, through the Commonwealth, funds support services for them to be able do so. This government has invested $2.2 billion to address the waiting list for home care packages. No-one is trying to pretend that there isn't more work to be done. There is, because of the enormous and increasing number of people who are staying in their homes longer and who are in need of support. But the reality is that there is only one way that we can make sure that we meet that expectation and that challenge, and that is to have a strong economy so that we have the tax revenue to make sure that we can fund the ongoing services. That's the basis on which this government was elected and is meeting the aspirations of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you compare that to the alternative approach, that of the opposition, of going to the election with 0.0 dollars of extra commitments, you start to see very clearly why some of us find motions such as this frustrating. We're investing an extra $150 million over three years from 2019-20 to expand Commonwealth Home Support Program packages in priority across Australia, and around 18,000 people are expected to benefit. And, of course, since the 2018-19 budget, the government has provided $2.2 billion, as I already mentioned, to release an additional 34,000 home care packagesâ34,000 more home care packages than those put forward by the mover of this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time we had an honest conversation about the challenges confronting Australia in aged care. It's part of the rich challenge that we face with an ageing population. The basis on which we start that conversation is by actually being honest. That's the problem I have with this motion. For this mover to stand at the lectern and move this motionâwhen those opposite offered nothing to the Australian people when they went to the election; perhaps that's one of the reasons why they now sit on the opposition benchesâand to make political use of some of Australia's most vulnerable people without full acknowledgment of their lack of support and care for them, is something that, frankly, I find despicable. But that is their choice and they'll be judged accordingly for their conduct. I think what we should focus on as a parliament is continuing to bring people together to support the government's program and to support the home care packages that Australians so desperately need. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I will pick up on what the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, was saying. He is 'frustrated' that he's got to defend this government's appalling record. He wants an honest conversation about what's happening in aged care in this nation. Well, I'm going to give him one, and I'm going to give him some honesty, because, whilst the government is 'frustrated' about motions in this parliament, I wish it were frustrated about the 120,000 Australians who, on its watch, are waiting for home care packages. That is practically an entire electorate of people who are not receiving the care that they desperately need. Perhaps most shocking of all is that 72,000 elderly Australians have no home care package at all. There are 72,000 people in this country with their names on a listâparents, loved ones, people with children and grandchildrenâand the government come to this chamber and say, 'We're frustrated that we have to get up and talk about these issues.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I bet you they're frustrated! How about the people who are frustrated and worried about their parents, their mothers-in-law and grandparents who are frail and invalid in their homes? That's what's frustrating, not sitting in this chamber and lecturing everyone to just wait until you get a stronger economy. Where is it? Where is the stronger economy? When's that happening? The last time I checked, our economy was starting to tank. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not have any more weasel words from this government. Get on your feet and start apologising to Australians. That's the first step you need to take. The number is growing. In their time, in almost seven years in government, the waiting list for home care has grown from 88,000 to 120,000 older Australians. We have been calling for action on reducing the waiting list since the first release of data, and we are not alone. Doctors and nurses are banding together to call for immediate action to fix the nation's aged-care system. Fine, ignore what Labor has to say, but listen to what the health professionals are saying. Listen to what doctors are saying about what we need to do with regards to fixing the aged-care crisis in this country. The AMA President, Dr Tony Bartone, said that the peak medical body 'can no longer wait and watch the aged-care system in Australia deteriorate'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is part of their detailed submission to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which has been extended for six months and has so far received more than 6,000 submissions and heard hundreds of hours of evidence, including of alleged neglect and mistreatment. People in aged-care facilities are malnourished. People in aged-care facilities are dehydrated. And we hear from this government that it's frustrated that it's got to come and debate a motion today. I'll tell you what's frustrating: it's when you're in an aged-care facility and you're dehydrated and malnourished, or you're a son or grandchild worried about the care of your parents or your grandparents in their own home. There is no more serious statistic in the AMA submission, when they called for a big investment in home care packages, than that there are 119,524 older people waiting for the level of package they had been assessed for in June, and 16,000 people had died waiting for one. And the previous speaker says, 'You shouldn't politicise this issue.' Well, it is political. You're in charge; do something about it! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only would we be saving people's lives; this would also help the budget, because at the moment  many older Australians are waiting for more than 12 months for the package they have been approved for and some are waiting for more than two years. This is unacceptable. We know that 14,000 elderly Australians have had to enter residential aged care because they could no longer stay at home waiting for the care that wasn't there. Others enter the hospital system and emergency departments. A week does not go by without another disturbing account emerging about the mistreatment or neglect of older Australians in residential care. Review after review has been ignored. Recommendations after recommendations have been ignored. Not only are the government not putting extra money in aged care; what's worse is that the government are cutting funds meant to find ways to improve the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see time and time again that the health and wellbeing of our eldest Australians should not be a political football. I will agree on that. But this should hardly come as a shock when we have a prime minister with an awful track record when it comes to funding for aged care in this nation. We know that the government has ripped billions of dollars out of the aged-care sector for the past five years. Funding for residents has indeed gone backwards. The Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from aged care in his first budget paper as Treasurer, backing in a $500 million cut in the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Not with a mediocre handout but with a decisive response that this crisis deserves, this government should be hearing these messages. I commend the member for Parramatta for sticking up for older AustraliansâI'll continue to do so, as every single Labor member will.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion on this government's actions to assist older Australians to stay in their homes longer. As I said in my maiden speech, we do need to do more for our older Australians who need assistance. I commend the minister and this government on making it a priority to invest more in aged care. In my electorate of Cowper, 27 per cent are over the age of 65 and that is rising at 1.3 per cent per year. This government promised to increase the number of home care packages, Commonwealth Home Support and residential home care places and that is what it has done. And it can only be done with a strong budget underpinning investment. We have increased our aged-care funding from $13.3 billion, when this government came in, to over $23.5 billion in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months we have increased the numbers of home care packages from 99,000 up to over 125,000. This is now projected to increase to 157,000 by 2022-23. This increase has seen a significant reduction in the waiting times and a decrease in the number of people waiting for their approved packagesâdown by 9,000 in the previous quarter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition claim that this government cuts spending on aged care when it has actually increased year on year. They need to stick to facts, look at the real story and offer meaningful debate over the best way to address the challenges ahead in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national prioritisation system, or queue, provides a framework for the assessment and allocation of home care packages consistently and equitably across the nation based on a person's needs and circumstances. A person's position in the national queue is determined by their priority for home care services and the time they have waited for care. People receiving approval for packages can receive an interim package whilst remaining in the queue. Over 97 per cent of people are provided with the opportunity to access services under the Commonwealth Home Support Program to ensure that they have options to address their care needs whilst awaiting their approved home care package. The system ensures that most people who are approved for care, and particularly high needs of care, have access to some level of subsidised care in their home whilst waiting for packages at their approved level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 June 2019 there were 47,000 people waiting for home care packages at their approved level who had been offered a lower level package. This figure is down by over 5,800. In the June 2019 quarter, 74 per cent of people had accepted the offer of an interim package while still considering their offer. Just over 12,000 of these people did not take up the offer for various reasonsâperhaps they decided to go into residential care, they did not need the level of care approved for that time or they were happy with the services they had been receiving. I accept, if we're going to have an honest conversation, that there are still 72,000 people who are waiting for a home care package at the approved level who have not been offered a package. However, that figure is down from the last quarter. Whilst this figure represents a considerable challenge, 95.6 per cent had been provided with access to the Commonwealth Home Support Program. Importantly, the number of people approved for level 4 packages who have not yet been offered a package fell by 34 per cent, or 11,000 people. The number waiting for a level 3 package also fell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like many of my colleagues, would rather engage in policy discussion on how to ensure older people in our regions and rural and remote communities can have a choice in providers, can access services and can stay in communities and close to their families. I recently met with a constituent in my electorate. Her husband has approval for a level 4 package but cannot find a provider to travel the 53 kilometres from Kempsey to provide services that will enable him to come home from his residential care facility. I'm pleased that the number of home care providers has continued to grow, including in my region of the mid-north coast. I will continue to work with my constituents, our regional providers and my colleagues on how we can improve access to services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more work to do. There are challenges now and into the future. The government have a plan and we have been doing that in a calm and considered way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Parramatta for the opportunity to talk on the subject of this motion today. In my electorate on the New South Wales south coast we have one of the highest numbers of age pensioners in Australia and I'm regularly hearing from people who are suffering because of this government's failure to provide them with adequate home care packages. One hundred and twenty thousand people in Australia are waiting for home care packages. This sounds like a high number; it is. But I want to talk about a smaller number: the individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January, Margaret was approved for a level 2 home care package. Margaret has mobility and neurological issues that cause her back and neck pain. She was discharged from the hospital in February and began receiving help through the Commonwealth Home Support Program. She was paying $140 out of her pension every fortnight for support services to help her shower, dry and dress, as well as cleaning and transport for shopping. It took Margaret eight months even to be offered an interim level 1 package, but this was less support than she was already receiving. In September she was reassessed and approved for a level 3 package, but all she has been told is that she will have to wait another three to six months before she can even get a level 2 package. Margaret, like many people in my electorate, lives on her own and is frail. She needs more support, but she has been abandoned by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Laurel. When she contacted my office, Laurel was in desperate need of a wheelchair. She needed help with weekly shopping, transport and social services. She needed to be on a level 3 home care package. She had been approved for the level 3 package, but she was only on an interim level 2. When she first applied for the level 3, Laurel was told that the waiting time was 12 months, but this soon blew out to 18 months. But, in fact, she waited 20 months, close to two yearsâlong enough for her needs to have increased, and she is now approved for a level 4 package. I understand she is still waiting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not isolated cases in my electorate. I was recently contacted by the daughter of a 92-year-old woman from Berry. She has a severe hearing disability and is very frail, but she wants to stay in her home. In July 2018, she was approved for a level 2 home care package. She is asking for someone to help with the housework and general maintenance. She wants a personal alarm in case she falls, because she won't be able to get help. These are just basic things to help this lady in her 90s stay at home. At the moment, all the help she gets is two hours of housework a fortnight and someone once a month to take her grocery shopping. After waiting 12 months for a home care package, her family tried to find out how much longer it would be and they were told she would have to wait another three to seven monthsâsome quite distressing news for her family that wants to grant their mother's wish to remain independent. Perhaps the most heartbreaking case of all was the poor gentleman who tried to get some help for his wife. She had been approved for a level 4 package but was only receiving an interim level 2 package. She was terminally ill, but she waited six months for her home care package. Devastatingly, she passed away before that assistance arrived. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't about statistics. It isn't about numbers. It is about peopleâreal people who are struggling, real people who deserve better than to wait years for the small level of help that can give them the dignity, support and independence they deserve. Without the support of these packages, many of these people could end up in our already overrun hospital emergency departments. They could be forced into aged-care homes before they are ready or before they should have to go into them. They could injure themselves, deteriorate their conditions further, or worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of my electorate deserve better. Their families deserve better. We need urgent action from this government to fix the mess that it has created. The government has to act now to stop the waiting list from continuing to blow out. It needs to show some real compassion and care to older Australians. These aren't numbers; these are real peopleâsomeone's mother or father, someone's wife or husband. They are someone to somebody. They are someone to me, and I will keep fighting to make sure they get the help they deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I thank the member for Parramatta for highlighting this pressing issue. Assistance to age in place has become the most in demand form of aged care. It's about showing respect for the wishes of older people to remain in their homes and part of their communities. Of the 72,000 people waiting without having been offered any package, 11,000 are assessed as requiring a level 4 package to stay in their homesâworth $50,000 per year. That most of those waiting have been approved for Commonwealth Home Support Program, CHSP, services is not an adequate remedy. It is a confusingly similar name but a very different program. The CHSP is designed to provide entry-level care to an amount below the lowest home care package. This is far less care than someone waiting for a level 4 package needs and deserves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see this lack of adequate care in the thousands of people on the waiting list being forced to enter residential care even though they can and want to stay at home. One man with motor neurone disease wrote to me to say he was told that his waiting time would exceed his prognosis, and still they put him in the queue. Another man wrote to me about how his wife was waiting so long for a home care package that he was no longer able to take care of her and had to place her in a residential care home. This makes little sense for government, as the annual spend on residential care per resident is higher than for a level 4 home care package. The lack of packages being made available is preventing the use of a lower cost option that the person concerned would actually prefer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current waiting time for packages is over 12 months. I have heard from constituents who have been waiting for over two years. We heard about them here this afternoon. But, in many cases, their care needs arise suddenly and they need immediate help. Earlier this year, I heard from a constituent who was the full-time carer for her husband. She was involved in an accident and needed to go to Melbourne for surgery. She was unsure how long she would be away. Not wanting her husband to go into care, she could not get the surgery without first getting funding for a full-time carer to replace her while she was away. When care at home is needed, older people are rarely in situations where waiting is easy. It puts strain on their families, and on their communities as well. When a person is approved for a package, they are assessed for what their needs are now, not in 12 months time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concern about waiting for home care is of special importance in regional and rural areas. We have older populations who are increasingly needing care. In my electorate of Indi, 21 per cent of people are over 65, compared with 15 per cent nationally. People in regional areas use residential care less than those in cities and face higher costs in travelling to services. In the Hume region, where my electorate is, there are 948 people on the waiting list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government for increasing the number of packages available and reducing the length of the waiting list in the last quarter; however, for older people and their families who need help now these changes are not moving fast enough. If we want to offer a consumer driven and market based home care system, we cannot have the number of packages capped so far below demand. I encourage the government to increase their rate of releasing new packages to clear the backlog. And, if the government cannot solve the problem, then we need to legislate maximum waiting times so that, in the future, older people can be certain of getting the right amount of care at the time that they need it.</span>

We do acknowledge that the government has done a little bit of work here, but when you've got 120,000 people on the home care waiting list, when you have seen the waiting list blow out from 88,000 people 2Â½ years ago to 120,000 now, when it's only due to political pressure from the community, from this side of the House, from unions, from workers in the sector that the government has finally actually done somethingâit wasn't a priority prior to that pressureâthen I think it shows just what sort of government this is. This government isn't doing anywhere near enough when it comes to aged care generally, as we've seen from the royal commission, but particularly in home care packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something the government could fix today if it wanted to. The government could easily bring forward packages that are in the forward estimates and deal with this issue today. The government also knows that there's about half a billion dollars currently sitting in unspent funds that could be utilised for people who have been approved a home care package. The government could also prioritise people with terminal illnesses who have less than six months to live or people in their 90s. The government could do so much more today if it chose to do so, but the fact that we've had six years of this government, four ministers, and the waiting list blowout over the last 2Â½ years, from 88,000 to the 120,000 that it is today, shows that whatever the government's doing it is nowhere near enough and it's not good enough for all of those people and their loved ones who are advocating so hard to try to get them the care they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard from so many speakers, these people want to stay in their own homes. They're able to stay in their own homes with a little bit of support. When you're in your 80s and your 90s and you've contributed to this country and you want a bit of support to stay in your home, you would have thought that the government of the day would actually be able to provide that support. Well, that's not what's happening in Australia today. We're a wealthy nation; the government should be able to fix this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, tragically, 16,000 Australians died whilst they were waiting for home care in the 2017-18 financial year. They died without receiving the home care they had been approved to receive. We also have heard that around 14,000 people on that waiting list went into residential care or hospital before they wanted to, or before they needed to, because the care that they needed to stay at home was also not available under this government. The government needs to listen to these stories; it needs to do more. You had the Prime Minister on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> saying that aged care, and home care particularly, was a priority. Well, it's not something you sit on for years if it's a priority; it's something you act on if it's a priority, and the government has been very slow to act. As I've said, they only acted in response to pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to turn up that pressure. Indeed, the parliament last week in the Senate approved a motion that was moved by my Tasmanian colleagues Senator Carol Brown and Catryna Bilyk that actually condemned the government for the shameful number of home care packages and the number of people on the waiting list today. So that's one chamber of this place that has actually moved a motion, which has been supported, to say the government needs to do more, as well as condemning the lack of action to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, we have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook coming later this yearâit's just a few weeks awayâand this would be an opportunity for the government to do something about the home care package waiting list. You've got the Prime Minister saying, 'Well, it's a priority for me,' on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> and then a couple of weeks later we have him in the parliament saying, 'No, no, no; I'm going to wait till the end of the royal commission.' This is something that doesn't have to wait. My call to the Prime Minister is this: you can fix this today. You can do things today to help people on this waiting list today. You have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in late November, early December. This is a great opportunity for the government to show that it is prioritising older Australians, to show that it will actually fund some home care packages. The government needs to deal with the home care package waiting list. It is simply not good enough that we still have today 120,000 older Australians on that waiting list. It is terrible to get those callsâas many members in here do, as we've heard todayâfrom loved ones trying to advocate for their loved person, to get them care so that they can stay at home, because they prefer to stay at home. In this country today, this should be able to happen. Australians who want to stay at home should be able to stay at home.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  Each October in our community we eagerly await the Strathalbyn country show. It is a traditional country show with a fierce fruitcake competition and rows of prize sheep and cattle. But, amongst the fairy floss, there is also a show of force from the Strathalbyn and Communities Suicide Prevention Network. The group spent the day promoting mental health by handing out quick guides on how to access help when you need it and working to ensure that we reduce the stigma of suicide. They visited every stall, including mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The network adopts a community based approach to mental health and empowers individuals, groups and organisations to look after the mental health and wellbeing of 'their patch', of each other, in our community. As they explained to me, it's about having the right conversations, offering the appropriate support and encouraging our communities to adopt a culture where it's okay to talkâan important message to get across in our rural communities at a time when even earning a living is proving to be a challenge for many of our farming families. Sadly, it is often our young men who find it hardest to speak up and ask for help when they are struggling to cope with the pressures of life. In 2018, suicide accounted for over 43 per cent of all deaths among 15- to 19-year-old young men and almost 40 per cent of males aged 20 to 24 years of age. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a federal MP, you attend many funerals in your community, showing your support, paying respect and joining your community to say goodbye. Earlier this year I attended a funeral not as an MP but as a friend to a young man just 19 years of age. I've known him since he was four, when he was at kindy with my eldest son. He was a little blonde Harry Potter. He was bright. He was creative. He had so much to give and live for. But he didn't realise, and it was too much. And now his family will never, ever be the same. I think of him so often and his beautiful, attentive mum, who kept every kindy painting. She adored her son. She will never get to see the man that he should have had time to become. She recently said to me, 'It's an epidemic, Rebekah.' Since the loss of her beautiful boy, she has heard from so many young people who have attempted or thought of suicide and from family members of people who have completed suicide. It is a fear that so many of us as parents face. The vulnerability of our young people is forever real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken at great length in this place about the need to improve services available for our young people in rural and regional South Australia, and I will continue to advocate for increased resources for headspace services in Mount Barker and Victor Harbor and the surrounding regions, including Strathalbyn and Kangaroo Island. My community, before I was elected, did not have a single headspaceâno footprintâacross more than 9,000 square kilometres. Headspace is not a panacea for all mental health issues for young people, but it is certainly a start. We must do all we can to equip our young people with the skills they need to navigate life, because the statistics show that they will confront the same if not greater challenges in later life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ABS data collected from Mindframe shows that, for men, the highest suicide rates occur after the age of 80. In 2017, Monash University reviewed 140 nursing home suicides that occurred between 2000 and 2013 in an attempt to better understand why. The study identified a diagnosis of depression in two-thirds of cases and that two in five experienced loneliness. This is something very real. Over half of men and women in residential care suffer from depression, compared to 15 per cent of individuals who live in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A KPMG report commissioned by Suicide Prevention Australia and released in September this year found that tackling social isolation in aged care is a priority because the statistics are high. But depression is not a normal part of ageing; we need to look at how we are caring for the physical and psychological health of our older Australians. I hope that when we have the interim report from the royal commission it will shed some light for us onto the treatment of mental health in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just like to close by saying that we're losing too manyâtoo manyâof our good young people and older people in our community. It is such a wicked problem that people have such a great sense of loss and a feeling that there is no hope. We must change this, and we can do this in our society.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I rise to acknowledge the recent World Suicide Prevention Day. The mental health of each of us in our community is one of the most important things that we can pay attention to. I recognise and celebrate the fact that we are taking action to deal with suicide issues all around the world, but particularly here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental disorders affect up to 45 per cent of Australians, and they have far-ranging effects that are long lasting. In fact, 3,000 Australians die each year from intentional self-harm. That's 3,000 individuals, 3,000 families and 3,000 communities affected by the terrible outcome of suicide. It has a major impact on our society. In fact, more than 100,000 life years are lost every year, and that's more than from all the 20 leading causes of death around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, men are affected more than women, with the suicide success rateâif you can call it successâof men being three times that of women. My own family has been affected by suicide. In fact, my brother Tim was lucky enough to survive multiple attempts at suicide. But my cousin Matthew, unfortunately, did not. That's because of the lack of services which we could wrap around my cousin Matthew, who was actually in a rural area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm very proud to be part of the Morrison government, which is making prevention of suicide one of its highest priorities in health. There has been a significant commitment to the Long Term National Health Plan. This is not only a personal priority of our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison; it is also a personal priority of Greg Hunt, our Minister for Health. This is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just an investment in terms of money; it's an investment in terms of strategy. There is $736 million being invested in mental health. That's a significant investment; in fact, it's the largest investment to date. Of that, $500 million is for youth and Indigenous mental health, and to look at suicide prevention plans. Importantly, Christine Morgan has been declared the National Suicide Prevention Adviser. That's to ensure that we have a whole-of-government approach to suicide. Because mental health actually affects so many different sectors of society, we need to have a whole-of-government approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the specifics of what our government is doing with regard to investment in this very important problem? We are establishing 12 National Suicide Prevention Trial sites across Australia. These are to look at trials and factors that can be used to prevent suicide. There is $48 million being invested into this initiative to help understand how to improve strategies for the effective prevention of suicide. We're also investing $9 million in infrastructure projects, through state and territory governments, to ensure that we can deter people from using locations which we know are at high risk of being used for suicide. We're investing $33 million in Lifeline, which is an incredibly important telephone crisis support service. We're investing $36 million in the National Suicide Prevention Leadership and Support Program and we're investing $12 million in Suicide Prevention Australia. Importantly, as we know, headspace is a wonderful initiative for our youth. It helps with prevention, and we're rolling out 36 new headspaces across the whole of Australia. I'm delighted that one will be rolled out in Higgins, my own electorate. This is important because we have one of the highest proportions of young people in my electorate and we have a thriving LGBTI community. We know that those who are from that important community have a much greater burden when it comes to issues with regard to mental health and suicide. So I'm very delighted that this vibrant community in Higgins will be supported by the new Higgins headspace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  Tuesday 10 September marked World Suicide Prevention Day, a day which we observe to raise awareness and to commit to action to prevent suicides in our communities. Suicide is an issue that no doubt directly affects many communities and families across the nation. Recent statistics by the ABS have found that last year alone 3,046 deaths by suicide occurred. Suicide rates amongst males are three times higher than for females. To put these figures in perspective, that's eight people dying by suicide each day in Australia. These numbers make it remarkably clear that we must work together to develop an integrated and coordinated response to this very concerning issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this note, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the tireless efforts of an organisation called MATES in Construction. It's an undertaking and it's worked in this sphere, and I pay particular respect to a good friend of mine, Brad Parker, who is the CEO of the New South Wales division of MATES. I pay respect to his dedication and commitment to leading the charge against suicide in construction. MATES in Construction was established in 2008 with the support of employers and the trade union movement to address high levels of suicide in the construction industry. It was formed in direct response to a report commissioned by the Australian Institute of Suicide Research and Prevention. The report found suicide rates in the construction industry were up to 2Â½ times higher than the national average. The research also revealed some very confronting facts. Every year, 190 Australians in the construction industry are taking their own lives. This means that we are losing one construction worker to suicide every second day. Research also indicates that most men in these industries tend not to speak about their feelings and emotions with their colleagues at work, pride being the main barrier. But also they found that a second problem was people not being prepared to seek out support. Given that I have two sons, Nicholas and Jonathon, both working in the construction industry, this area is pretty close to my heart. MATES in Construction's program is based on the notion that suicide is everybody's business. In order to see a sizable improvement in the building and construction industry, we must not shift the responsibility solely onto mental health professionals; rather, we must ensure that everybody in the industry is playing their role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For workers in construction, suicide appears to be part of the reality of working in that industry, which is dominated by tough working conditions, very strict guidelines, time constraints and a highly transient workforce. MATES in Construction recognises that the program must be aimed at providing both training and support. Without both, the results would be insufficient. According to MATES, to do only training, without pathways, is potentially dangerous, and to do support without raising awareness is simply another employee assistance program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The MATES in Construction program delivers general awareness training to workers on site, firstly to raise awareness that there are problems with suicides in the construction industry and also to alert workers to the contributing factors and warning signs that they should look out for amongst their fellow colleagues. The next step is to provide support through clear pathways of help, with case management processes being an integral part of ensuring that workers in need of support are connected with the appropriate help. Onsite visits by field officers are also conducted to support a site and its workers, ensuring their presence until the site is closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As have many of my side, I have had the opportunity to attend training sessions with MATES in Construction. I did one at one of my local construction sites and got to see firsthand the grassroots work that they are undertaking to improve mental health and to lower suicide rates in the construction industry. As I said, MATES in Construction is supported by all major employers in the industry, as well as by the various unions operating in that space. I encourage every member to get behind this great organisation. Make an arrangement to attend, as I did, a training session on a site. You'll get to see the absolutely instrumental and groundbreaking work being undertaken by this organisation, which is making a difference for the better in our industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  World Suicide Prevention Day is a time to reflect on those lives we've lost to suicide and to share the responsibility that we as a community have to check in on our loved ones. It's also a time to restate the commitment the Morrison government has to progress the goal of zero deaths from suicide. I'm pleased to see the government's support for mental health and suicide prevention delivering more than $60 million to the Gold Coast in the five-year period from 2016-17 to 2021-22 for various programs. Unfortunately, the Gold Coast endured a higher suicide rate than the national average of 12 lives per 100,000 people, losing 14 lives per 100,000 people between 2013 and 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Moncrieff, there are some very special community groups who provide invaluable services to our community to assist those with mental illness. Southport headspace are to be commended for the wonderful job they do to assist youth living with mental illness. Suicide continues to be one of the leading causes of death for our young people, as we've heard from many members today. This is why the Morrison government is delivering over $1.1 million in the next year to headspace Southport for the services they provide to those in need of help in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending the headspace day, where a toolkit for a healthy headspace, with seven tips for a healthy headspace, was highlighted. The seven tips are to get into life, to learn skills for the tough times, to create connections, to eat well, to stay active, to get enough sleep and, of course, to cut back on alcohol and other drugs. Myf and Steve and the rest of the team are doing a terrific job to raise awareness of issues such as bullying and alcohol and drug use. Headspace Southport is one of the busiest centres in the country, with 11,600 occasions of service in the last financial year, compared to the national average of 3,700.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gold Coast Centre Against Sexual Violence is another organisation doing an incredible job of providing free counselling, advocacy, information and practical legal support for women who have experienced sexual violence. This centre was founded by Di Macleod and is the only one of its type on the Gold Coast. I commend her work and the work that she does at the coalface, which changes the lives of many Gold Coasters. It was incredibly moving to hear the brave survivors' stories as part of their candle-lighting ceremony recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Towards the latter years of our lives, there can also be a tendency to feel lonely or depressed. I want to acknowledge the great work men's sheds are doing in my electorate, helping our senior Aussies with their mental health and wellbeing by preventing social isolation and providing meaningful projects. On the central Gold Coast we have the Veterans Support Group Men's Shed, the Ashmore Men's Shed and the Nerang Men's Shed. I recently visited the Ashmore shed as part of national Men's Shed Week. The fellows there are currently putting the finishing touches on a mezzanine and a refreshments area, which is looking great. I was privileged to hear the stories of the president, Gil, and of Graeme, David, Mal and Don. Don summed up the importance of the men's shed quite perfectly when he explained that if it were not for his new mates at the men's shed he'd still be at the pub instead of enjoying two years of sobriety and a healthy social life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnam Veterans Federation has just received additional funding from the Morrison government's BEST Program. The $135Â½ thousand will go to supporting their advocacy service, for which there is high demand and which assists ex-service personnel and their families with their entitlements. The service is important because it assists in reducing the waiting time when our veterans most need it. Next door to the advocacy service is a men's shed for male and female military veterans, which is an additional place for support. Congratulations to Peter and Peter, who have worked to get this project off the ground. Nerang's men's shed will be hosting an expo at Country Paradise Parklands this weekâ74 sheds have been invited to attend the event. Unfortunately, I will be unable to make it, but I congratulate them on holding this event, which is connecting men's sheds around Australia. There are so many great organisations that play an important role in reaching out to some of the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity to commend the government's commitment to work with local communities to reduce the number of deaths by suicide in Australia. I welcome the establishment in 2019 of the office of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser to support a whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention. This will ensure the coordination of suicide prevention activities reach Australians in the right way at the right time. To close, a conversation can make a difference and it can save a life. Be sure to ask your loved ones the important question: R U OK?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  This motion, noting World Suicide Prevention Day, provides an opportunity for this parliament to acknowledge the grief that we feel across our community about those we have lost to suicide and to share the responsibility for preventing further suicides. Modelling released in September of this year by Suicide Prevention Australia shows that suicide rates will grow by up to 40 per cent over the next 10 years without better prevention and earlier intervention. The government has the full support of Labor to bring about that better prevention and earlier intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's target of reducing the suicide rate to zero, along with the appointment of Ms Christine Morgan as National Suicide Prevention Adviser to the Prime Minister, is commendable. Like all other Labor members, I look forward to working with Suicide Prevention Australia and members of the government to bring about this ambition of zero suicides. There is of course much to be done by all of us in this chamber and across the community, working together, to achieve it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations in the newly released National Mental Health Commission's 2019 report on mental health and suicide prevention reform are an excellent starting point for the work we need to get on with together, such as the collection of high-quality data, particularly on the scope of disorders and high-risk community groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; undertaking a mental health service gaps analysis and implementing a National Mental Health Commission workforce strategy; addressing the broader social and economic factors that contribute to mental illness and suicide; fixing the NDIS so that streamlined access for people with psychosocial disability is working and continuing to deliver support for those who are ineligible for the NDIS; and making sure that all relevant government departmentsâHealth, Education, Justice, Social Services, and Housingâare responsible for the design and implementation of all future national suicide prevention strategies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While suicide doesn't always occur with mental illness, experts tell us that vulnerable individuals who have an accumulation of adverse life events and are experiencing mental illness are particularly vulnerable to taking their own life. Each year, around 950,000 young Australians aged 12 to 25 will be affected by a mental health issue. Nationally, there are 110 headspace centres that support young people to strengthen their wellbeing and manage their mental health. We are very proud of the Frankston headspace, in my electorate of Dunkley, which is operated by YSAS. It delivers support for young people in the areas of not just mental health but physical health, drug and alcohol issues, and work and study, including through a youth health clinic staffed by local GPs; a GPs in schools program at McClelland College and Mornington Secondary College; and Peninsula Pride, which is a queer-straight alliance youth program funded through the Victorian state government's Healthy Equal Youth project that aims to raise awareness, promote diversity, eliminate stigma and discrimination and improve the overall mental health of young LGBTIQA+ people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> While headspaces across the country, like ours in Frankston, encourage resilience in young people today and every day, it is important also to note the unmet demand for youth mental health services. Headspace has assisted 520,000 young people since it was established in 2006, but we know that close to a million Australians aged 12 to 25 will face a mental health challenge each year. The majority of young people with mental health difficulties do not access services, and that's something that we need to change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working in my community to do that. On 2 October, the Mental Health Foundation of Australia held a Youth Suicide and Mental Health Forum in Frankston. I was fortunate to be on the speaking panel with Professor Richard Newton, the clinical director of Peninsula Mental Health Service, whose keynote speech was informative and challenging, and I'm grateful to him for providing me with a lot of the data that he relied on, and which I am relying on today. We have high rates in our area of people presenting to ED with self-harm. We have high rates, unfortunately, of people committing suicide and we have a number of young people who have killed themselves who are connected, but we are working hard in my community to support programs to address this. One of those programs is THRIVE, which is a commitment to ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of every member of the school communities of Elisabeth Murdoch College, Langwarrin Primary, Langwarrin Park Primary and Woodlands. It's the Langwarrin positive education and community network, and it is doing terrific work: students thrive, parents thrive, teachers thrive and the community thrives. I'll be pleased to keep supporting that initiative as I continue as the member for Dunkley.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Death is such a dark topic, and suicide, in particular, is such a dark topic. We all know the statistics: eight people in Australia die by suicide every single day. Between 2013 and 2017, the average was 2,918 deaths by suicide per year. It's the leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 44. Seventy-five per cent of people who die by suicide are men, 68 people of people who attempt to take their own lives are women and 65,000 Australians have attempted suicide over the past year. For every death by suicide that occurs, there are families and loved ones who, like me and countless others across Australia, are bereaved and struggle to put their lives back together with the loss of their loved one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the darkness, what has given me hope in this space since I have been a member of parliament is the number of people who have made it their life's mission and focus to do something about suicide prevention. We have something of the order of 35,000 organisations in this country. It's worth just saying that number again:  there are 35,000 organisations that deal with mental health and suicide prevention. That says something about the scale of the challenge and the wide effect that suicide has right across our community. As we know, not everybody who has a mental illness will die by suicide and not everybody who dies by suicide has a mental illness, but there is a strong connection between the two of them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be part of a government where the Prime Minister has made zero suicides a focus of his policy. It would have been easy to say, 'We'll promise to reduce the suicide rate by 10 per cent,' but he's taken the courageous decision of saying, 'Let us reduce it to zero.' The Prime Minister is right in doing so, because any death by suicide is a death that should have been avoided. We need to send the message to Australians more broadly that the world is better off with them. That's why I think the government's focus, particularly on the mental health and suicide prevention of young people and Indigenous people, is so important. There is the package of over $500 million targeted at Indigenous people, particularly in the Kimberley, and those two committees that are being chaired by the minister himself. We are looking at ensuring that you've got round-the-clock phone counselling and culturally appropriate material for Indigenous people, and also that you've got awareness across the community of the signs people might see when somebody they know might be contemplating suicide, and awareness of what to do about itâthat's such an important process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are three particular areas where we can make an impact on suicide prevention. First, we know people who are released from acute mental health units who have made an attempt on their own lives are the most likely people to die by suicide. If you go to hospital for a broken leg or a broken arm you'll often go to rehab. Sadly, in our country, not everybody who is discharged from an acute mental health unit goes into a community mental health facility. It's the reason why the government chose, in the previous budget, to fund Beyond Blue for some of the work they're doing with the way back program, providing rehabilitation and getting people back into their communities. We need to continue to do this because they are the obvious group of people who we know are most at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we know that the crisis linesâall privately run, like Lifeline, good people doing good worksâtry and answer as many calls as they can but they don't answer every call. The government has provided, in the previous budget, $34 million to increase the number of calls that are being taken by Lifeline, but we can always do more to increase those calls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we need to create greater community awareness so people know the signs and know what to do if a person might be contemplating suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to end my contribution today with a quote from Arthur Miller's <span style="font-style:italic;">Death Of A Salesman</span>. At the end of that play, Willy Loman's wife, Linda, has this to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the paper. He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I'm very pleased to be able to speak on this bill. In a previous life, prior to coming to this place, I served as a police officer in a country town. I attended many suicides as a police officerâmany dozens over a period of four years. In fact, on one particular day I attended on three suicides. I'm very pleased to hear today that both sides of the floor are bipartisan and intent on reducing deaths by suicide to zero. I'm also very pleased to be part of a government that has that policy and is working towards that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect that suicide not only has on the families of those who die, but has on the community around them is astounding and tragic. It's tragic for the first respondersâthe police, the ambulance, those who have to attend, the medical officers and the people around themâparticularly attending on those who are young. They were the hardest deaths to attend as a police officer, the teenagers. The teenagers who felt that they had nothing or had no-one and had no future, and yet the signs were all around that that's how they felt. But that was back in the late eighties, early nineties, and so much has changed since then. We have changed to recognise that firstly we need to have that conversation. We need to have that conversation about mental health. Over the past two or three decades, we have come so far to talk about that, to have that conversation, to ask, 'Are you okay?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of headspace centresâand I'm particularly proud of the headspace centres in Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour and the work that they do. I can say that they are overloaded. They are stretched so thin. I can guarantee them that I will continue to fight for further funding for those centres. I am also very proud to say that there will be a further headspace centre set up in Kempsey where the overrepresentation of youth suicide exceeds far and beyond not only the state but Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy to be able to speak on World Suicide Prevention Day, as I am on headspace day and R U OK? Day, because this government has now invested a record amountânever seen beforeâtowards suicide prevention, towards talking to the community and towards talking to those who feel that they have nothing to offer. In my 18 years as a criminal defence lawyer I dealt with many who had mental health issues. I dealt with many who, unfortunately, took their lives by their own hand because of the situations they found themselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel that if the progress which has been made over the last 10 years had not been reached we would still be in that position. But because of this government's investment, and because of the bipartisan approachâand I thank the other side for thatâwe are working towards that zero number. But it will take more than the government's contribution; it will take the contribution of those in the community to step outside of their comfort zones and speak to somebody, asking: 'Are you okay? Do you need help?' They need to refer them to somebody, a professional, even sometimes against their own will. That's because in time they will turn around and say, 'Thank you.' That's what we need to do for the benefit of our nation and for the benefit of our people. One life matters, and we can make that difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Morrison government and I thank the other side for their bipartisan support. I will continue to do everything I can to support people with mental health issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Recently, I met with James Fletcher, a resident of Warringah, who is very concerned about the government's move to replace the CapTel handset service. James is one of 4,000 hearing impaired Australians who rely on CapTel to maintain communication with friends, family, government services, clients, business associates, technicians and tradespeople. The existing CapTel service works like any phone, except the caller's voice is changed to text on a small screen attached to the phone, with captions provided by the National Relay Service. From 1 February 2020, the NRS will no longer support the CapTel handset, so users must switch to a teletypewriter in order to receive captured phone calls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At my meeting with James, he invited me to use this new service. I have to say I was shocked at how difficult, complicated and prone to error it was. From my experience that day and from feedback I have received from James and many others like him, it seems this new service is a step backwards. It is too difficult to use, especially for the elderly. We are facing the very real danger that members of our community who are already in a vulnerable and isolated state are about to lose a very important service and sense of connectivity. I urge the government to reconsider its decision and to discuss with both CapTel's Australian licence holder and Concentrix ways to enable the continued use of the CapTel handset.</span>

Jack Gerdes, a 27-year-old constituent of mine who came from Mount Perry, died on 7 July 2019 as a result of a coalmining accident at Baralaba coal mine in Flynn. The hearing into this mining fatality is taking too long. It takes an average of six to 12 months before a decision from the workplace health and safety mines inspector to finalise his investigation. That is far too long. Why does it take so long? There have been six workplace fatalities in the mining industry in the last 12 months. That is six too many.</span>

It appears that Jack was searching for a pair of reset buttons that were tucked in behind the rails of the staircase leading to the machine. This incident was an avoidable tragedy and highlights the need for practical safety procedures to protect our mining community while they work. Anyone who works in a coal mine expects to come home that night in a safe condition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  In 2017, the Uluru Statement from the Heart outlined a pathway towards reconciliation and towards constitutional recognition of our First People. I am very pleased to say that, on Thursday 7 November, Senator Pat Dodson, from Western Australia, also known as the Father of Reconciliation will be coming to my electorate of Macnamara to deliver a lecture, 'On the road to reconciliation'. It is fitting that Senator Dodson will be delivering this lecture, which is the Marek Edelman Centenary Lecture. Marek Edelman was a freedom fighter. He fought in the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising. He was actually the leader of that uprising after Mordechai Anielewicz was killed in the fight in the Warsaw Ghetto. After the war, Marek Edelman served in Poland as a senator, fighting against fascism and standing against anti-Semitism, and, of course, he was famous for standing up against the silence of the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s. It is fitting that Pat Dodson is delivering the Marek Edelman lecture this year as Pat talks about the pathways to righting the wrongs of the past, to building an Australia that is inclusive of our First Nations people and to making sure that Australia is a place where we bring people together and we celebrate our differences and we celebrate our shared past.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Congratulations to Dr Graeme Stevenson, who was named the 2020 Tasmanian Senior Australian of the Year on Friday. Hailing from Somerset on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Graeme affectionately refers to himself as a 'poo-ologist.' He's a soil assessor, an agronomy consultant, a Landcare volunteer, an author and an educator. Graeme's particular passion is spruiking the benefits of introducing dung beetles and earthworms into gardens and pastures. Graeme's been a Landcare volunteer with the Elliott and Wynyard Landcare groups since 1993. During that time, he's managed almost $1.5 million worth of projects for Landcare in Tasmania. He's also been involved with the Somerset and Camdale Coastcare, Burnie Farmers Market, Tasmanian organic groups and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If all that isn't enough, Graeme shares his soil knowledge with school children as his alter ego Dr Spluttergrunts. He takes poo and his earthworms into classrooms and he spreads the good word about the importance of soil health. So you can imagine the important conversations that are held after school when mums or dads ask the question, 'What did you learn today?' and the kids answer, 'Poo.' Well done to Graeme for improving the health of our natural and working landscapes and encouraging people in our region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  The international community and thousands of Cambodian Australians will be watching Cambodia very closely on 9 November, the Independence Day of Cambodia. This comes after a lengthy period of growing oppression of civil and political rights in that country. We've seen the assassination of activist Kem Ley. We've seen the imprisonment of opposition leader Kem Sokha and the shutting down of free media like The Cambodia Daily and the local Radio Free Asia outlets. We've seen the deregistration of the official political opposition, the CNRP, and most recently the laying of additional trumped-up charges against long-time opposition leader Sam Rainsy. Mr Rainsy has announced his intention to return to his homeland from exile on Independence Day on 9 November. Cambodians are showing their support for Mr Rainsy's return with the 'nine fingers' campaign. In response, the dictator Hun Sen has threatened to cut off the fingers of those who have been showing their support that way. He's also threatened violence against Mr Rainsy and any supporters who accompany Mr Rainsy on his return on the ninth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the Australian government to watch these events very closely. As a key player in the Paris Peace Accords 28 years ago, Australia has a particular responsibility to speak out strongly in support of civil and political freedom in that country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I just want to give a shout-out to the Bundaberg Christian College and their year 9 groups, 20 of which came through my office on 11 October. This is part of a year-long unique right-of-passage educational program, and I want to congratulate Sue Hibbard, the secondary schoolteacher who organised and coordinated all of these groups. Why was it so important? Because it was a little bit different. What it was about was ensuring that individual groups of students can come into a local MP's office, or somewhere like the city library or the Bendigo Bank or a post office, and they had some challenges put forward to them. They had to ask to speak to the nominated person. They had to ask four general questions. They had to introduce themselves and their team with a firm handshake and to look in the eye of the person they were speaking to. I think that's an incredibly good thing to be doing in terms of education, because it teaches them to be independent, to be organised, to be on time, to be confident and have a go. There were a few which were a little bit challenging for them to get past. The eye contact, I have to say, was difficult for a couple of participants, but they got through it. I want to congratulate the Christian college and, once again, Sue Hibbard for the work that she is doing to encourage independence in our young students and to encourage confidence, because, if I could give our young children anything at all, it would the confidence to get on with what it is that they want to achieve in their life. There are opportunities galore if you just have the will, if you want to do the work and you are confident enough to take it on.</span>

The Morrison government is abandoning Stones Corner, leaving businesses in the dark and leaving local loyal postal workers without jobs. Shockingly, LNP Senator Stoker and a local LNP councillor petitioned their own government to save the post officeâthey didn't pick up the phone to their own government colleaguesâbut, since the government's refusal to step in and save this vital community service, the local LNP have just given up, calling this a win for our community.</span>

Is it that four long-service local post office workers are losing their jobs without compensation or is it that the stripping of post office boxes from many small and local businesses reliant on its service is going ahead? With friends like the government, who needs enemies?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way to protect vital community services in our local community is to vote this mob out. Vote them out of government and vote them out of council. That's why, at the council election in March 2020, I will be supporting Patrick Condren for lord mayor and our local Labor team, a team ready to stop the perks and get to work, a team ready to put residents back at the heart of council.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Last week Clean Seas Seafood won the South Australian Exporter of the Year award at the Business SA 2019 Export Awards. They also won the Adelaide Airport Agribusiness, Food and Beverages Award. They also, in 2016 and 2017, won Best Fish at the Australian Food Awards. Their Spencer Gulf hiramasa kingfish is grown in the cold waters of Spencer Gulf. They have powerful marketing, great packaging, classy promotion and a superb product. Seven or eight years ago, their industry was in crisis when they were losing up to 80 per cent of their stock to a problem with the food supply. They retreated down to Port Lincoln, but they have stabilised those problems. They've overcome those problems and they are back with a vengeance. They are planning to double production over the next three years, to 4,000 tonnes a year of premium product. They won $2Â½ million from the Regional Jobs and Investment Package into the Upper Spencer Gulf and have been negotiating to bring fish farming back to Whyalla, where it had been previously successfully done. They've had a few teething issues with the council, getting access to the marina there, but I am very confident that resolution will be found soon and this great industry will be expanding back at Whyalla.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  On Wednesday 9 October I hosted the 2019 Holt Local Sporting Champions grant presentation at the Arthur Wren Hall at Hampton Park. I was very proud to present 12 young sporting champions with an award for their sporting achievements. I especially thank the parents and grandparents who attended and who offer so much support to these young stars. The Local Sporting Champions program provides financial assistance for competitors aged 12 to 18 participating in state, national or international sporting championships. These 12 exceptional young athletes were recognised at the ceremony. As well as receiving grant amounts of between $500 and $700, the recipients received a framed certificate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to put their names into the parliamentary record: Aedan Nelson, for tennis; Riley Simmons, for basketball; Blake Shankland, for swimming; Mia Foster, for swimming; Shahd Mohamed, for athletics; Wadah Abdelrahim, for athletics; Zoe Nitsiopoulos, for gymnastics; Andy Tapatuetoa; for rugby league; Baylin Dixon, for karate; Katelyn Faifili-Boon, for rugby league; Alannah Gillespie, for basketball; and Jemma Reynolds, for basketball. This program allowed, for example, Blake Shankland, from the Casey Cavaliers, to compete for Victoria at the under 18 junior championships and Shahd Mohamed from the Frankston Athletic Club to compete in the athletics Australian all schools championships. It's a great program that provides opportunity for young people to achieve their dreams in athletics and other sports.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Dr Robin Crisman of the Somersby Animal Hospital for receiving a Practitioner of the Year award at the Australian Veterinary Society's ASAV conference earlier this month. Dr Crisman received the prestigious award for her outstanding service to the veterinary profession and the public, for her academic qualifications, standard of practice, professional profile and altruism. Dr Crisman has been practising veterinary medicine for over 25 years, during which time she has managed smaller-animal emergencies as well as routine healthcare check-ups for household pets, farm animals and racehorses. When Robin isn't working at the Somersby Animal Hospital, she's providing veterinary services for race days right across New South Wales and veterinary care to wildlife at both the Australia Walkabout Wildlife Park in Calga and the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby on the Central Coast. Robin's passion for her role as the head veterinarian and director at the Somersby Animal Hospital is a true asset to our community, and her humility is an example to all of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Somersby Animal Hospital is one of many great veterinary services in my electorate which provides care and treatment for pets and Australian wildlife, so I take this opportunity to thank also the Walkabout Wildlife Park and the Australian Reptile Park for the fantastic work they do locally in ensuring our beautiful native wildlife is conserved. I congratulate again Dr Robin Crisman on receiving this prestigious industry award.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  This weekend in my electorate of Fraser we recognise the exceptional contributions, hard work and determination of remarkable residents and community organisations through Brimbank City Council's community awards. Today I would like to recognise the winner of the Culture, Arts and Tourism Award, which recognises outstanding contributions to the rich cultural heritage, tourism and artistic fabric of my local community. The award was won by the Sunshine Short Film Festival. Now in its seventh year, it has added culturally to the area and created awareness of Melbourne's west on a global scale, attracting entries from overseas filmmakers. Often original content entered into this film festival goes on to win awards at other local and international film festivals, including the St Kilda, Sydney and Canada film festivals, to name just a few. The event encourages young people to embrace creative and positive pursuits, and the festival also has an important educational function in my electorate. This event is the culmination of nine months of work for the dedicated volunteers, who successfully promote strong positive messages about the vitality, diversity and cultural richness of Melbourne's west, also helping to dispel some misconceptions of the area. This wonderful event has also made the Millennium Man of the old Sunshine Harvester Works justifiably famous. I also congratulate the other winners of the awards.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to thank and congratulate the service men and women and the families of the 7th Brigade from the Gallipoli Barracks in my electorate of Ryan as they mark the end of their ready period. For over 12 months the 7th Brigade has been in their ready period, which made them the go-to brigade for Australia's land force requirements. The period involves significantly more training as well as a number of operational deployments for the service personnel across that period. Within the brigade there were almost 2,000 people who were deployed during the ready period, on five different operations overseas, as well as 400 members that went for training in Malaysia. They've had a particular focus during the ready period on our pacific regionâour neighboursâwith a number of them having come to train in Australia with our forces. So, for the service men and women of the 7th, this has been a key period of their service where their skills were put to the test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For their families it was a particular sacrifice requiring the serving mums and dads, husbands and wives to be away from their loved ones for lengthy periods. These families, who play an enabling role, are just as important as the service personnel themselves. They mark the end of this busy ready period with an open day at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, where those families can come and spend some time on the base and share some quality time together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The open day was well supported by the local community who especially enjoyed seeing the new boxer vehicle, but, like me, they wanted to extend their gratitude to the service men and women of the 7th and their families for their efforts and sacrifices.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Kat Jeffress and her family used to have a dog called Banting, named after Frederick Banting, inventor of insulin. One night, Banting jumped up on Kat's bed, waking her up. Kat realised one of her children's glucose alarms was going off. Like its namesake, Banting has saved the life of Kat's son, Ethan. Kat and husband Stuart have three children: Amy, Ethan and Mia, and the youngest two have type 1 diabetes. Ethan and Mia showed me their small fingertips, each marked with dozens of pinpricks. They showed me their continuous glucose monitors and talked about how good it would be if in the future the monitors could connect with insulin pumps and make injections easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a strong commitment to addressing type 1 diabetes through better funding for research and devices. Unfortunately, it's been nearly eight months since the Morrison government promised Australia's 120,000 type 1 diabetics that they would have access to the Flash glucose monitor on the National Diabetes Services Scheme. The monitor gives diabetics a choice in how they read and monitor their glucose, but without a listing many diabetics can't afford it. Alongside research, Australia's diabetics need access to new technology to help manage their condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ethan and Mia Jeffress are amazing people who deserve as bright a future as any young Australian. My thanks to JDRF and it's campaign team, including Mel and James Eveille, for their valuable work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I rise to reflect on and pay tribute to a school in my electorate, St Peter's Girls School, which celebrated it's 125th anniversary at a remarkably well attended dinner on Saturday night. I was very honoured to be one of the special invited guests and to be with more than 600 people at a sellout celebration of their 125 years educating young women from Adelaide. It was a spectacular celebration of the history of a school that's educated more than 10,000 young women who have gone on to contribute so much to the city of Adelaide, the state of South Australia and, in fact, the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about so many components of the school's history of success in academia, in leadership and in the sporting field. In particular, I might note for members that the school has made two very significant contributions to this building, because two of the old scholars are the Hon. Amanda Vanstone, a former senator who is also the longest-serving female cabinet minister in Australia's history, and Julie Bishop, who was the member for Curtin until the recent election and the first female foreign minister in Australian history. I was very appreciative of being one of the special guests on the night, and I pay tribute to a school that's contributed so much to my city and my country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  After 170 days, the government has finally appointed a CEO for the NDIAâthanks to political pressure from people with disabilities, their advocates and Labor. The jury's out on new CEO; some in the sector describe his best qualification as 'managerial digital wonk'. We do wait for him to detail any real lived experience of disability, but we remain positive. We need to actually start fixing the neglect, negligence and red tape suffocating the vital national project which is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It doesn't start with P&amp;L spreadsheets, corporate KPIs, managerial mumbo jumbo or millions of dollars to private consultancies of well-known companies. It starts with a focus back on people with disability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what Labor has been doing since the election. I've visited six states and territories, and held 20 disability forums and events. And I have discovered there tend to be two types of participantsâthe two Davidsâof the scheme that I have had the privilege to meet. For David Carey in Melbourne the scheme has lived up to its original promise. But then there are people like David Morrell, who I met in Launceston. David Morrell is severely vision impaired; he carries a cane. To get by in daily life he needs a text-to-voice electronic document reader. Due to a shortage of NDIS accredited allied health professionals in Tasmania, there's no-one who can give him the expert approval that the agency needs to give David the money to get his device. After months of torturous negotiation, he's now getting his own money together to fly to the mainland. This isn't good enough.</span>

Labor's Scott Stewart, Aaron Harper and Coralee O'Rourke are constantly missing in action. To be honest, I think they just don't care. I think they have given up. I think they just don't represent their constituents well whatsoever. This is very evident when we're talking about Palm Island, which is in the electorate of Herbert. Palm Island residents have had to boil their water and now have to get bottled water shipped across because Scott Stewart hasn't done his job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went to Palm Island as a candidate, we announced $2 million to help out with their water security. Scott Stewart said, 'We don't need it.' What did he do next? Just couple of days ago, he jumped up in the media and said, 'Where's this money?'âthe money that he told me he didn't need. I also found out he emailed the Minister for Indigenous Affairs at 10 am and then demanded, at 1 pm, that we abide by his request. That's not how it happens. He's putting politics above people, and this is just continual. They can't talk about mining, they hate coalâdon't even get me started on thatâand crime is out of control. They've done nothing and they'll do nothing. They have no policies. They've shut down boot camps. They love bail houses. They just don't represent their constituents anymore. They don't represent us.</span>

Close to 1,000 locals came on the day to enjoy the new park and take part in the activities. Wally Bell provided a great welcome to country, Farrer Primary School provided the music, and there were plenty of activities for families. Congratulations on the day to the Farrer Residents Association, the Farrer Primary School community, the Fox and Bow cafe, the Tuggeranong Arts Centre, Kael da Costa Photography, the Farrer Neighbourhood Watch, the Woden Community Service and the ACT Labor government. In particular, congratulations to Alex from Fox and Bow, Wallo from the residents association, the hardworking Farrer P and C and my friend Chris Steel MLA for your commitment to the Farrer community and your hard work in making this a reality over the last two years. It's a great example of the community coming together to deliver an imaginative recreation space that local families will enjoy for years to come and of what happens when the community and decision-makers work together rather than take a divisive us-and-them or winner-takes-all approach.</span>

I'd like to take this moment to thank the Brisbane Sikh community, who yesterday celebrated the birth of their spiritual master by hosting a successful community tree-planting day at Eagleby wetlands in my electorate of Forde. Off the back of our motion this morning about multiculturalism, I think it's very relevant and very heartening to see so many people from different cultural backgrounds and faiths come together for the benefit of the environment. Many families with children and babies in tow showed up to roll up their sleeves and plant over 1,000 saplings for the conservation of the local environment. The attendees also enjoyed a traditional brunch served by volunteers and watched a performance by a choir and martial art demonstrations by the kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme of the day was to reconnect with nature, because one of the concerns of the Sikh community is that, as we're becoming increasingly dependent on technology, that is disconnecting us from nature and each other. I believe doing this environmental work begins with local communities fostering a connection with their natural environment, so I'd like to extend my thanks to the Brisbane Sikh community for their efforts and hospitality and, of course, to everyone who pitched in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Today I want to pay tribute to a very good friend of mine and a really true believer who lies gravely ill in a palliative care unit at the Alice Springs Hospital. Peter StrachanâStrachy as he's known to his matesâwas born in March 1949 in Melbourne, where he grew up and went to St Dominic's, St Kevin's and the University of Melbourne. He became a public servant in 1973. He spent his life serving the public. He became the regional manager of the Commonwealth Employment Service in Alice Springs in 1992. He later joined and worked with Tangentyere Council and the Central Land Council. For 25 years he's been a member of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He met his wonderful wife, Fayeâthe love of his lifeâand was welcomed into a large network of family and friends. They had a daughter, Laraâthe light of his life. He is a most devoted supporter of the Pioneer Football Club in the Central Australian Football League and, sadly, a Collingwood tragic. He's been my pew buddy at mass over many years. Strachy's now into time-on, having played the game of his life to the whistle without argumentâriding the bumps, always putting his team and family first. Yesterday his daughter Lara's high school graduation ceremony took place at his bedside. He was surrounded by loving family and friends and the school community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strachy is resolved as he confronts the time ahead. He is nurtured by his very strong faith. And, by his many barrackers, his family and his friends across the country, he is much loved.</span>

That's why the Morrison and the Marshall Liberal governments are working together to bust congestion and fix the Springbank Road intersection. Together, we are investing $60 million to ensure that local residents can get to work, get their children to school, get to the reactivated repat hospital site, get to Flinders Medical Centre or get to Flinders University quickly, safely and easily. This is part of our $100 billion federal government commitment to busting congestion around Australia, which in my electorate also includes fixing the Hove crossing and upgrades to the main road corridor in the hills and the Fullarton and Cross Road intersection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure will be holding public information sessions for local residents on the Springbank Road intersection upgrade so they can find out more about the project and provide feedback on the early concept design. I encourage everyone in my local community to come along and have their say. Drop-in sessions will be held at the Colonel Light Gardens RSL this Wednesday 23 October between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm and this Saturday 26 October between 1.00 pm and 3.00 pm. My state colleagues Carolyn Power, Sam Duluk and I will continue to work hard to keep local residents up to date on this project and to see this critical congestion busting infrastructure project delivered for our community after many years of Labor government inaction.</span>

It's a great example of a model that represents the power of early intervention. It allows deaf children to get the best possible start to their education while navigating the challenge that hearing loss presents. Graduates of the early intervention program have better than average language outcomes compared to their normal hearing children. My niece Kelly was one who graduated some decades ago and now leads a fulfilling life because of what they provided. I congratulate Dr Jim Hungerford, CEO of the Shepherd Centre, and his team for creating and maintaining a long history in improving education and social outcomes for children who are deaf or who have hearing loss.</span>

We began at NIOA where Rob Nioa himself inspired us with the story of how his father's business, selling firearms to local farmers from the back of a ute, has grown to form such an important part of Australia's domestic defence industry sector. We toured the warehouse floor and the heavy duty vaults that contain NIOA's cutting-edge ammunition and weapons. We inspected their indoor firing range where military personnel are put through their paces on small arms weapons systems and were shown some of the 155mm artillery shells that NIOA and Rheinmetall will be manufacturing as part of their Maryborough Forging and Manufacturing Facility.</span>

We saw seven of these undergoing the maintenance and even had the rare privilege of sitting in the cockpit. I'd like to thank Rob Nioa, Andrew Mathewson, and everyone at NIOA and Airbus, who so enthusiastically supported our visit, as well as the Fisher business leaders who took part.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  There were 25,566 women transported to Australia between 1788 and 1853, of whom 1,600 came to Newcastle and to the Hunter more broadly. For over 15 years, the Roses from the Heart project has travelled Australia and the world. Part of that is the Bringing the Bonnets Home project, where a bonnet has been made for every woman who came to Australia under hard and terrible conditions. We brought the bonnets back to Raymond Terrace, to Sketchley Cottage, on Saturday afternoon and had a magnificent high tea. I say thank you to Ken Barlow, the president; Laraine Brown, the secretary; Brett, the retired chef and the member who is in charge of the food; Boris, the life member; and Matt Garrett, our MC; as well as to Pia and the other members of the Raymond Terrace and District Historical Society, who have done such a magnificent job of bringing our history to life in Raymond Terrace, sharing it with school children, interested old people in our community and people who just want to know about our history. A big shout out to Vicky Osborne: Vicky, you've done a magnificent job of coordinating the bonnets. I know that many thousands have been on display, and you have been a particular champion of this project and our history. Thanks Raymond Terrace, and bring on the high teas!</span>

In various areas of my electorate and, indeed, Australia where drought is an unrelenting fact there are whole communities bearing the weight of an unpredictable future. It is vital that they be able to depend on one another and on all levels of government to help them shoulder this weight. The Morrison-McCormack government has focused on our farming communities and is flexibly addressing the serious needs resulting from this prolonged drought in the here and now and into the future for our farmers and our communities. It is this last component I wish to speak about today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Drought Communities Program invests $1 million into shires that meet criteria determined by the department of the minister for drought. The funds have been well utilised by the Buloke shire and the local sporting community of Charlton. I had the privilege of being there yesterday to open the new Charlton Park. What a wonderful resilient community they are, who have shown through persistence and collaboration that great things can be achieved together. I commend the committee for pulling together the whole community and the various sporting clubs for coming together for the hope that is provided that community. Well done!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  On the economy, investment and wages are down right across the nation, with our economic growth at its slowest since the global financial crisis, leaving more Macarthur households and businesses feeling the pinch. Despite worldwide economic devastation during the GFC, the then Labor government steered Australia into being one of the fastest-growing economies. Unfortunately, today under the Liberals we've dropped to 20th, according to the OECD. As Ross Gittins very ably points out in his article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> today, the government's policies might make good politics, but they're very bad economics. Minister Cormann has described wage growth as sluggish and has made it clear that this performance 'is a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture'âthey are his commentsâarguing that wages should be flexible to meet changing economic conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's shameful that the Liberals have run on platforms of jobs and growthâ'If you have a go, you'll get a go'âyet go out of their way to restrict wage growth and cut penalty rates. Hospital waiting lists are blowing out for both outpatients and elective surgery. Australians don't want the Morrison government to shift the focus away from the real issue. Australians need an economy that provides for them and they deserve a government that works for them. Scott Morrison and the Liberals have been in government for six years, with the Prime Minister having once been Treasurer, so the buck must stop with them. We need to do more to stimulate our economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Â Â Â I wish to congratulate the students of Holy Cross Catholic Primary School at Bondi Junction in my electorate of Wentworth, who have worked together with SolarBuddy and Origin Foundation volunteers to build solar powered lights for their fellow students in Papua New Guinea. Holy Cross is one of 55 schools participating in this program to build solar powered lights which are then sent overseas to children living in remote communities. The lights are small, portable and waterproof. They work for eight to 16 hours. Just a few weeks ago, 4,000 of these solar powered lights were delivered to villages along the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40 per cent of children under the age of eight in Papua New Guinea can't read or write. In part, this is due to a lack of lighting after dark. This is an entirely preventable issue, and yet without adequate lighting for study a child's ability to develop the skills needed to read and write to break the cycle of poverty is impeded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The SolarBuddy workshop aims to tackle social injustice in the sphere of learning, and highlights the importance of light in a child's education. In Australia, lighting is a resource we take for granted, and it's certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about study resources. However, in countries like Papua New Guinea it is just as important as pencils, paper, books and teachers. The students at Holy Cross primary school are the bright future leaders of our community, and have become conscious global citizens. They're committed to doing their best to help their fellow students in other countries.</span>

The Meriton Group is proposing one of the most outrageous cases of overdevelopment in this small community. The Meriton proposal will see high-rise towers on Little Bay Cove cast a dark shadow over the future of this coastal community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This big developer has ignored the approved master plan for the site, which already permits lower density, low-rise residential development of up to six stories. But, no, that's not good enough for Meriton. They've come in with a proposal for 22-storey towers and a hotel on the site. That translates to nearly 2,000 more units in blocks of up to 22 storeys, along with the hotel, and yet the existing master plan was in place when Meriton bought the land in 2017. They knew very well what they were buying and now they're selling out the Little Bay community. It's a developer that wants to double the population in an area that's already struggling with traffic congestion and poor public transport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 4,000 locals have already signed a petition against this outrageous case of overdevelopment. This Sunday, a community led rally against Meriton's rezoning application will start at McCartney Oval in Little Bay from two o'clock. I'll be joining the rally with a large number of others from our community, and I encourage everyone who is from a community that is sick of Meriton developments destroying their area to come along to Little Bay on Sunday afternoon and have their say about this outrageous case of overdevelopment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Our year 12 students are about to say farewell to their school days, with final exams currently underway. I want to start today by wishing all of our year 12s the best of luck now and in the years to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional youth are 40 per cent less likely to go into tertiary education than their city counterparts. While some of our graduating students may choose other pathways, such as traineeships or apprenticeships, others risk being left behind in their education journey due to the hindrances of living in regional Australia. Where you live should never determine the scope of your potential. The Morrison government has a plan to reduce the disparity facing our regional communities. Our National Regional, Rural and Remote Tertiary Education Strategy aims to implement federal policies to ensure our regional youth get a fair go once they leave school.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial support is often the main factor driving a wedge between a person's aspirations and their reality. My colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to ensure regional youth get access to the support they need while they study. I'm pleased to say that the hard work has paid off. Just last year we made further legislative changes to make it easier for regional youth to access youth allowance. I want to see greater access to secondary and tertiary education in the regions, to generate greater opportunities and choice for our young people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see our young people reach their full potential, uninhibited by the additional challenges they face because of where they live. This government, through improved access to education, will unlock the potential in our regions to build an even better and stronger Australia.</span>

The award was accepted by Trish Heffernan and Steve O'Byrne in acknowledgement of everything that Djerriwarrh Community and Education Services has accomplished since 2007. Over that time, Djerriwarrh has been working in partnership with Western Health to create stronger pathways to employment. This project has two purposes: to create sustainable, ongoing employment opportunities for local job seekers and to provide work-ready applicants for roles in health services assistance at Western Health.</span>

The course includes an industry placement at one of Western Health's locations and it's a wonderful example of work-integrated learning in action, leading to positive, sustainable and enduring post-study employment. Students who successfully complete the certificate II are eligible to apply for a paid traineeship at Western Health, leading to a Certificate III in Health Services Assistance and ongoing employment. I acknowledge Djerriwarrh for their success and thank them for their contribution to the Brimbank and Fraser communities.</span>

Jane was awarded the Clunies-Ross Entrepreneur of the Year award by the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering for her achievements as scientific and operations director of Ego Pharmaceuticals. Jane leads the research and development of evidence based skin products that change people's lives. In the process, she has created hundreds of export orientated jobs for talented students of science and engineering. I have been to the factories, and they are most impressive and a proud representation of the innovation and entrepreneurship that sits at the heart of the Goldstein community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jane's team produces skincare products that provide sun protection and treat head lice, eczema and skin tears. Jane is enthusiastic about productivity enhancing technology and is hoping to bring forward the next phase of manufacturing, where interconnected machinery can produce better products more efficiently and, critically, make more jobs here in Australia to export products to the world. Equally, Jane advocates for Ego's products to be sustainable by minimising water and energy usage as part of a sustainable environmental agenda. Many Australian advanced manufacturers are world leaders in delivering high-quality and innovative products to meet a diverse range of needs. Well done, Jane and husband, Alan, for your contribution. We admire your talent and your entrepreneurship. Keep going.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this motion states, 29 October this year marks the 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organization. That's a century of advancing social justice and promoting decent work. There's a reason to celebrate, because quite simply the world today is a better place because of the ILO. As a specialised agency of the United Nations, it's been a key force across borders in helping to reduce exploitation, discrimination and inequality, and promote collective bargaining. The organisation was established following the First World War in an effort to bridge the gap between governments, employers and working people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILO rose from the ashes of that disastrous conflict, the war that was meant to end all wars, created  in the belief that social justice is essential to universal and lasting peace. Originally an agency of the League of Nations, the ILO has continued as a specialist agency for over a century. Today, 187 member states work together on improving labour standards and developing standards throughout the world. It's a tripartite organisation that seeks cooperation between governments, employers and workers through the development of policy, standards and programs that reflect the views of all representative groups. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILO has a rich history of fighting for some of the world's poorest people. It's played an important role in Australia and beyond our shores by improving incomes, working conditions, safety, equality and protections at work, as well as boosting productivity and living standards. The organisation has been a driving force behind reforming oppressive work practices, removing discrimination and, importantly, ending child labour. The ILO has passed some of the most important international agreements that Australia is a signatory to, including the Forced Labour Convention of 1930, banning forced or compulsory labour; the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention of 1948, providing the right to union organising for collective bargaining; the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention of 1949, protecting against discrimination for joining a trade union and taking collective action; the Equal Remuneration Convention of 1951, providing the right to equal pay, and the removal of gender discrimination; the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention of 1958, providing the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin; and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention of 1999, prohibiting the worst forms of child labour, notably slavery, prostitution, drug trafficking and other dangerous jobs. Today the work of this wonderful organisation has made a profound transformation. The next century will see globalisation and technological change create even more new paths to prosperity, but so too will existing work arrangements be upended. The disrupters will soon be disrupted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change, shifting demographics, migration and changes in the organisation of work will affect all societies, including our own. The demand for some jobs will change, while others will disappear or may not resemble what they used to be. The ILO will remain a constant among this certain change. That's why Labor calls on the government to adopt a more cooperative approach to workplace relations in Australia, in the model of the ILO tradition that's been in place for 100 years. That tradition is one of the parties getting together and working together on problems in workplaces throughout the world, ending some of the worst forms of discrimination; introducing equality; boosting the wages, conditions and living standards of workers; and, in doing so, lifting national income and lifting people out of poverty in so many societies throughout the world. It's that tradition, instead of one based on conflict and union bashing, that we call on the government to adopt in their approach to industrial relations. Working with unions and employers can help to improve Australia's incomes and living standards, and I'm very pleased that the member for Cooper, who has had a long involvement with the ILO through her role as the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, will be seconding this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I'm extraordinarily grateful to the member for Kingsford Smith since he gives me the perfect opportunity to highlight once again for the benefit of the House the stark contrast which exists between some of the best of what has been achieved in protecting workers and the diabolical conduct of the absolute embarrassment which passes for a trade union in the Australian construction sector today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Banning forced or compulsory labour; prohibiting discrimination on race, gender, religious or political grounds; and working to stop dangerous child labour are critical projects, and doubtless the International Labour Organization has played a valuable and worthwhile role. But, in stark contrast to these admirable achievements, what is today's CFMMEU fighting for? It is the right for workers to walk off the job if the temperature exceeds 28 degrees Celsius and the humidity rises above 75 per cent in South-East Queensland. For the benefit of our southern members, 28 degrees is not a hot day in South-East Queensland. Frankly, I hope the CFMMEU officials who dreamt this up are ashamed of themselves, but I wouldn't hold my breath. There were 13 days last year which would've been lost as a result of these conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's what today's CFMMEU is fighting for: nearly an extra three working weeks off for its members, which most workers would be ashamed to take, surely.  Those are 13 days a year on which our police officers, firefighters, council workers, farmers, and posties will carry on working and contributing to this country while watching our construction workers shirk off for a lie-down in the shadeâthat is, only those construction workers working on a CFMMEU building site.</span>

                  </a>  I'm a builder, so there you go, shut down. Unfortunately, however, as we know, today's CFMMEU gets much worse than simply proposing unproductive and unfair rules like this. Just a few days ago we saw the latest in a seemingly endless procession of fines imposed on the CFMMEU for unlawful behaviour. No amount of financial penalties, it seems, is enough to make these recidivist law-breakers reconsider their constant contraventions. There's an irony to this motion coming, as it does, in the wake of this latest judgement. The member for Kingsford Smith asks the House to recognise the ILO's role in promoting freedom of association, while, all over Australia, it's a freedom that the CFMMEU consistently denies to workers in the construction industry. In the most recent case, a CFMMEU official, Kevin Pattinson, defied that right by preventing an electrician and a young apprentice from working on a site at Monash University, because they were not members of the union. As Justice Snaden said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is bad enough that it should so casually intrude upon rights of free association so valued by societies of conscience; much worse that it should do so, yet again, in deliberate defiance of the law that it has been told time and time again that it must obey. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt the fines of $69,000 imposed by the court will do anything to stem the tide of CFMMEU law breakingâ$16 million of previous fines have not. As Justice Snaden pointed out, there is a 'long list of judicial officers whose exasperated admonitions appear to have been met with studied indifference'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorian state secretary John Setka is reported to have been dismissive of judges who:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ call us criminals [and] all sorts of things [and] fine us millions of dollars [despite having] probably never done a dayâs work in their li[ves].</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Mr Setka and his co-conspirators in the CFMMEU do not want their organisation to be called criminal, I would suggest that a simple remedy exists: stop behaving like criminals, learn to obey the laws of the country and get back to work. This week Mr Setka is taking part in the CFMMEU's national conference in Adelaide. I understand he's trying to bring the South Australian branch of the union under his own branch's control. God help the country and God help the currently successful and growing construction industry in South Australia if his empire building is allowed to go on. </span>

It then ran smack bang into the turmoil of the Great Depression, fascism and the resulting Second World War. In the midst of that war in 1944, the US and other allies had the foresight to recognise that the ILO would be a key part in building a more prosperous and peaceful world. In 1944, the countries that could gathered together as the ILO issued the Philadelphia declaration. The declaration formed a series of key principles to embody the work of the ILO: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 73 years, the governing body of the ILO, the annual International Labour Conference, ILO committees and ILO expert bodiesâwhich I have proudly been a part ofâhave played a major role in making us think about global standards for workplace rights and safety, fair jobs and social protections. The remarkable thing about the ILO is that it is tripartiteâthe only United Nations organisation so structured. One half of the votes are the participating nations, one quarter are representatives of employers and one quarter are representatives of workers organisationsâunions. This means that, when conventions and recommendations are adopted, they've been carefully worked through to achieve an outcome that most tripartite partners are comfortable with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other remarkable thing is that, unlike the mythology about UN organisations, no outcome is imposed on any country. Apart from the core eight conventions, it's up to individual countries themselves to adopt and ratify conventions and their recommendations. However, the foundation of the ILO is a recognition that isolationism by wealthy countries will be to the detriment of every country. That is because unless you lift living standards and workers' entitlements then we all know that poverty and inequality within and between countries will lead to conflict and that low wages and low living standards will see capital and jobs move from one country to another. That is even more true today than it was in 1919 or 1944.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the modern world, the ILO has an enormous amount of work to do to ensure that we consider and understand the future of work, consider the effects of mass migration of labour and consider the behaviour and responsibilities of transnational corporations. In a world where many of them have bigger budgets than many small countries, it has been the ILO that has done such important work in the last two decadesâin Burma, after democracy was restored; in Bangladesh, after Rana Plaza; and in Cambodia. The ILO assists developing countries to build modern regulatory systems, and it would be to our detriment and to the detriment of millions of workers around the world if we did not have these standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the problems that face workers today are age-old in nature. To name just a few, there is modern slavery, sex discrimination and lack of social support. I'm honoured to have been part of the ILO process and, in particular, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention. I actually pay tribute to the then Liberal IR minister, Eric Abetz, who ensured that it was ratified by Australia. There is the Domestic Workers Convention. There is the Violence and Harassment Convention, which absolutely outlines that employers and workplaces have a role in dealing with family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition governments over the last six years have not fulsomely funded Australian ILO participation or the work of the ILO. On the occasion of the ILO's 100th anniversary, we should recognise it as one of the most enduring, important and successful of all the United Nations bodies. We should all recommit, in a bipartisan way, to supporting the ILO in its important work and to funding it accordingly. I say today: happy birthday to the ILO, and thank goodness we have it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  It's a privilege to be able to speak on this motion, because at the heart of this motion is the very aspiration of a nation and a global community to achieve the good ends of a hard day's pay for a hard day's work, of people living with the dignity of work and of being able to build a better world. That's why I'm actually quite happy to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organization. It's an organisation that, despite the protests of the member for Cooper, is built from the idea that countries work together to achieve global ends based on our collective interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we won't be dictated to by those organisations; we will simply do what we can to work together with others when it achieves our ends. Of course, the mover of the motion, the member for Kingsford Smith, particularly called on those in the government to, as he said, stop union bashing. I might remind the member for Kingsford Smith of the traditions and the foundation of the modern Liberal Party. In fact, I have on my phone right here a flyer where the author, Sir Robert Menzies, talked about how we believe in the rights of wage earners and we stand for the best wages and conditions that industry can afford. We stand for incentive payments for increased production and for profit-sharing wherever possible and practical. We stand for the right of unions to express their wishes through the democratic medium of the secret ballot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition governments have consistently supported the rights of working people. What we have never supported are the interests of trade unions over their members. We have stood by the workers, not by collective centralised interests. The member for Kingsford Smith, if he were honest, would recognise that he should not be calling for the end of union bashing; what he should be calling for is the end of union bashers, particularly where unions bash their members and their interests. That's why the member for Fisher was so prescient in his observations, particularly about the CFMMEU and in the calling out of their conduct and their misbehaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about the ambitions of the International Labour Organization, you think about global aspirations for the type of world that we want to live inâone where people can work, where we're free from discrimination and slavery, where people can go about living their lives freely without coercion. Do you think today that's an aspiration that shared by people like John Setka, with the type of conduct that he has sanctioned and endorsed? Whether they like it or not, the Australian Labor Party, by choice, are joined at the hip with the CFMMEU and their acolytes, and, by that continued relationship, they are ultimately sanctioning and endorsing that type of conduct.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just look at some of the statements that have been made not by me, not by members of the government, but by people of independent courts, like Justice Bromberg from the Federal Court:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there is no evidence before me â¦ of any compliance regime ever put in place by the CFMMEU to address its long history of prior contraventions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what's the response? Fine after fine after fine for their conduct. Justice Burnett from the Federal Circuit Court said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The CFMEU, as a holistic organisation, has an extensive history of contraventions dating back to at least 1999. The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the organisation either does not understand or does not care for the legal restrictions on industrial activity imposed by the legislature and the courts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the despicable history of the CFMMEU, amongst many others.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the 100th anniversary of the ILO and the aspirations that sit behind it, we look to the Australian trade union movement and their political representatives in this place and say: 'How about you aspire to meet the aspirations of the organisation that you want to celebrate on its centenary? Why don't we live up to the aspirations and why don't you sign up to the aspirations of improving living standards, engaging in lawful conduct and making sure we remove slavery and discrimination?' That would be a sincere motion in defence of and advancing the aspirations of the ILO today. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the motion from the member for Kingsford Smith paying tribute to the International Labour Organization for reaching this incredible milestone of 100 years. It's a pity that the speaker before me didn't seem to actually appreciate the significant role that Australia has played as a founding member state of the ILO and a continuing key partner in the ILO in promoting in a decent work agenda for people across the globe. Indeed, the cooperation between Australia and the ILO in our region is profound and absolutely worth celebrating. As I said, Australia has been a member of the ILO since it was founded back in 1919. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILO was the first specialised agency of the United Nations. It started at the end of World War I with the mission of advancing social justice and human and labour rights by establishing international labour standards. A former ILO director-general has described the primary role of the ILO today as being:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter which part of the world you live in, your ability to get decent, secure work will have an enormous impact on the kind of life you're able to live. It's very easy to take things like the eight-hour working day and minimum wages for granted, but we need to remember that they don't come about by themselves or by accident. They come about through the tireless commitment and hard work of organisations, of bodies, like the ILO. Indeed, the ILO has been at the forefront of defining, defending and enshrining these sorts of rights across the globe since its inception. It has a century's worth of achievements in bringing to an end exploitation, standing up to discrimination and addressing inequality. And it's driven some of the most important and wide-ranging international labour agreements and conventions in history. These include the banning of forced and child labour, enshrining the right to organise and the right to equal pay regardless of gender, and protection against discrimination on any grounds, including race, gender, religion, political affiliations or union membership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILO has also worked tirelessly to address specific issues of worker exploitation on the ground. I was very fortunate to be part of a parliamentary delegation to Doha last month. I was especially pleased to meet with the head of Qatar's International Labour Organization Project Office. We discussed the ILO's work on the ground and the groundbreaking reforms they were embarking on in Qatar to protect the rights of migrant workers, including the freedom to change jobs, the removal of exit permits and a non-discriminatory minimum wage. Given that 90 per cent of the population in Qatar are migrant workers, these changes are profoundly important, and I am very pleased that Qatar's Council of Ministers has now formally endorsed these reforms and that they will come into force in January of next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this has been achieved through a very unique tripartite governing structure. Here representatives from government, employers and workers work together to debate and develop these important labour standards. The ILO has demonstrated time and time again that this is a fantastic model that works well. But of course it takes genuine commitment from all sides to be negotiating in good faith. This government could learn a lot from this model. Too many times we've seen this government take an actively aggressive position when it comes to workers' rightsâwe've just heard the rhetoric from the speakers before me. Indeed, the only thing that seems to energise those opposite is attacking organisations that are there to protect workers and fight for better conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has left energy policy to languish and hasn't attempted to solve issues like homelessness and poverty, it has devoted an incredible amount of time to policies designed to tear down unions and slash workers' pay and conditions. We all know what that's led to: record profits and flat-lining wages, which, in turn, have driven widespread inequality, a hollowing out of the middle class and dangerously flagging growth. I urge this government to look at the evidence, listen to the experts and start a genuine engagement with workers and the organisations that represent them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I'll congratulate the International Labour Organization on its 100th anniversary, because what all of us know in this place is that to achieve 100 years in terms of longevity is incredibly difficult, whether it's you as a human, whether it's a business or an organisation, or whether it's something like the International Labour Organization, and congratulations should be given.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ILO's decent work agenda helps to advance the economic and working conditions that give all workers, employers and governments a stake in lasting peace, prosperity and progress. But there is an incredible difference between the ILO and the current Australian Labor Party, I have to say. Quite simply, the Australian Labor Party has abandoned workers in this country. They do not represent working people anymore, and I'll expand on that as in the next few minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where do they come from? According to the ABS Characteristics of Employment in August of 2018, of the 10Â½ million employees who were surveyed in August 2018, 15 per cent reported being a member of a trade union associated with their main jobâso roughly 1Â½ million members. Where have they come from? In 1976, there were 2Â½ million members. I think if we want to compare and contrast the 1976 ALP with the current one, we need to look at the change in population. In 1976, there were just 14 million Australians. There are now 25 million. That is an incredible change, over four decades, as to who was actually representing working people. Why is it so? Quite simply, the decisions made by Labor governments, whether they be state or federal, have not been in the interests of people who are out there working hard, who are putting on their steel cap boots and their high-vis shirts and their working helmets and construction gear and going out there and earning a living. These are individuals who are proud of what they do; they're proud of their job and they're proud of their industry, and they have every right to be so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some examples we only need to look at the true Premier of Queensland, Jackie Trad, who said to the entire resources industry, 'You need to transition out of your industry into another job.' This was to an industry that provides over $200 billion of GDP for Australia and over 200,000 jobs. And in some places generations of one family have worked in that industryâthree, four or five generations, all the way back to when the first coal was actually shipped from here to India in the 1800s! It might have been earlier than that, but it was substantially a long time ago.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Australian Labor Party no longer represents working people at all. If we look at the sugar industry: what they've done now in Queensland is extend what they called the reef regulations into my region. These are the reef regulations which have been in place in Far North Queensland, in areas where there is run-off that goes out towards the Great Barrier Reef. But what we know, and what's been put up by scientists, is that my area of the catchment simply doesn't go into the reef. So they have put another layer of legislation and bureaucracy over those hardworking individuals who are on farms, whether they are members of unions or not, for a regulation which makes absolutely no difference to the outcome for the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at vegetation laws, it's exactly the same. There is no greater renewable industry than the timber industry. It is the useful product which grows over a period of time and which can be replaced. It's been a very important industry right across Australia for a substantial amount of time and yet we have Labor governments continuing to put those people out of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So once again we can look at what Australian Labor says compared to what it does. It is not about working people. That's because it wants to take away their jobs and their right to earn; the ability for them to pay for themselves and their families, to educate their kids, to put food on the table and to pay for their own housing. I just think it's abhorrent where the Labor Party has ended up over this period of time. Unfortunately, it now represents some kind of inner-city trend which is the slogan of the day. This morning we saw the announcement of a climate emergency. It was so important to the Australian Labor Party that there were six of them in the chamberâjust six! That is sloganeering at its absolute worst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can look at what happened in Queensland with the Paradise Dam. What a debacle! The Australian Labor Party and the Queensland Labor government have tried to spin their way out of this. The first thing was that it was free water for drought-stricken farmers. The next one was that it was an inquiry into emergency management procedures for downriver communities. The latest one is, 'We've filled the weir at the Gregory River,' which supplies the townships of Woodgate and Childers. Now of course we have an unspecified safety issue. The reality is that the loss of that water is the loss of wealth in my community; it is the loss of future jobs. It is something that the Australian Labor Party should be standing up for and delivering opportunities for those individuals, whether they live in the cities or in the regions. Unfortunately, they have absolutely lost their way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important issue that I speak about today, this private members' motion that I've put forward. I'm pleased to speak on it because road safety is everyone's responsibility. It doesn't matter whether you're a truck driver or a cyclist or a pedestrian, you have a responsibility to use the road network, our road transport system, in a way that ensures that you get home safely and that your conduct gives other road users the best opportunity to get home safely. We all need to strive for that goal of zero fatalities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, and in most of the developed countries, we've adopted a safe systems approach. This is a methodology that's built on the premise that humans, road users, are fallible and that we will make mistakes and that we need to educate drivers to the best of our ability. But we also need to ensure that we have the best technologies for our vehicles to make them as safe as possible and that the standards for our vehicles are as high as they possibly can be. Another responsibility is, of course, building safe infrastructure and that's a very important element of the safe systems approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal government our main responsibility with the road transport network is the national highwayâsome 14,000 km of national highway. We heavily fund big infrastructure projects in conjunction with the states, but we mustn't forget, and we don't forget, as a government that there are some 900,000 kilometres of roads in this country and they are the responsibility of both the states and the local governments. That's where the Commonwealth helps out with other kinds of funding, such as the Bridges Renewal Program and the Roads to Recovery program. These are major funding initiatives under which the Commonwealth, in conjunction with local governments and the states, puts forward money to ensure that we have the safest road network. The Black Spot Program fits into that category.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Spot program is part of our National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020. It's a program that enables individuals, local governments or states to apply for funding where a location has a crash history or a record of serious incidents. Under the funding we can put in some form of treatment to remedy it. That treatment might be signage or a roundabout or lights. There are any number of different options that can be put forward under the Black Spot Program, which is why it is a successful program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government takes this program very seriously. In the last budget we committed some $50 million in addition to the existing $60 million that had been contributed to the fund, putting our annual contribution to $110 million a year. Over the decade 2013 to 2023 we'll have spent some $1 billion. Already since we've been in government some 2,300 treatments to roads, improving their standard, have been completed under the Black Spot Program. We know that the majority of serious crashes happen in rural and regional areas, so 50 per cent of all black-spot funding is assured of going to non-metropolitan areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The true indicator of the value of the black-spot funding is the results. It has been proven that where black-spot funding has been used there has been a 30 per cent reduction in fatal and serious accidents. That is quite an outstanding reduction in accidents and is something that we need to take note of. It's certainly something we need to continue to fund. It's estimated that some 280 lives will have been saved and 14,000 serious crashes will have been prevented in the decade. I encourage everyone to ensure that they keep a close eye on this program and put in an application where possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of the motion of the member for Wide Bay. The Black Spot Program is vitally important in any electorate but is particularly important across the rural communities that the member for Wide Bay and I represent. I acknowledge the latest round of funding, announced by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development in July, when the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development funded three black-spot projects in my north-east Victorian electorate of Indi. In Towong shire the program is contributing $179,000 to improve safety on the Lake Road near Bethanga. In neighbouring Alpine shire, on the spectacular Bogong High Plains Road, it's providing $1.418 million for major safety upgrades. In the southern shire of Murrindindi it's contributing $51,000 for kerb warning and speed signs and markers on Skyline Road near Eildon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department's Black Spot Program web page shows that funding is mainly available for work to reduce road risks at known black spots or to improve safety on road lengths when there is a proven history of accidents. Eligibility can be considered when at intersections or mid-block or short road sections there is a history of at least three casualty crashes over a five-year periodâon lengths of road there should be an average of 0.2 casualty crashes per kilometre per annum over the length in question over five years; sites have a recurring problem; and, finally, there are road locations that could be considered as accidents waiting to happen, where there should be a road safety audit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I'd like to draw the chamber's attention to a notorious section of a major highway in my electorate that should qualify for support from this program.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day before the 2019 election result was declared in Indi, I was visiting the communities of Marysville and Alexandra. In two meetings, local people again told me about the Black Spur section of Maroondah Highway. The highway has a history of distressing, fatal and numerous serious injury crashes, but community concern about the risks at Black Spur is so pronounced that two weeks ago at Marysville Community Centre up to 200 people gathered to discuss what can be done. My colleagues from the Victorian parliament Cindy McLeish MP, member for Eildon, and Tania Maxwell MLC, member for Northern Victoria, were present. So was Murrindindi Shire Council's chief executive Craig Lloyd, representatives from Murrindindi Inc. and VicRoads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maroondah Highway is the only direct major road from the Yarra Valley town of Healesville, up towards Narbethong and through to Buxton or across to Marysville. It then goes north to Taggerty. From there it heads on to Alexandra, while another arterial road branches from it at Taggerty to carry traffic to and from Eildon. The highway is critical for business and tourism between Murrindindi communities and Melbourne's east. It's also a spectacular drive, described to me as the ranges' version of the Great Ocean Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Black Spur remains a serious challenge for people and communities on the highway because for much of its winding length of about 10 kilometres it is impossibleâand illegalâto overtake. It's a road that needs better signage, more slow vehicle turnouts, better sealing, bicycle lanes and active management of old roadside trees, because the road passes through a wonderful forest of mountain ash. As it is, when trees fall or accidents occur, the road is often closed for hours. This forces travellers to take major detours on unsealed forest roads or back through Yea to drive an alternative route to Melbourne. Maroondah Highway is to be closed for three days this week and one day next week in daylight hours for major tree-felling works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in the communities of Murrindindi want a safe and reliable highway. The Black Spot Program can help to deliver one. I look forward to working with government to make this happen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  Road safety is a national priority for the Australian government, and it's committed to reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes. The Black Spot Program is part of that intention. It's estimated that over 10 years these 2,374 projects will have saved 280 lives and prevented 14,400 crashes. The Black Spot Program provides funding for safety works, including roundabouts, crash barriers and street lights at places where there have been serious crashes or where serious crashes are likely. Of the $1.7 billion federal contribution, a total of $19,720,471 has been put towards projects in my electorate. That's a lot of money. In Monash, so far 55 of the proposed 68 projects have been completed, with the remaining 13 to be completed in the near future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2019-20 budget the Australian government has committed to an additional $50 million per year to the Black Spot Program from 2019-20. This additional funding is part of a $2.2 billion Local and State Government Road Safety Package. The government will provide $1 billion to the Black Spot Program from 2013-14 to 2022-23. A total of 275 projects across Australia have been approved for the 2019-20 program year, bringing the total number of projects approved since 2013-14 to 2,374. I am concerned about where this money is being spent. I've just been made chair of Victoria's Black Spot Program committee and I've learned a whole lot more about the program than I knew before. Thank you to the Deputy Prime Minister for the appointment, which carries no benefit but probably a lot of hard work!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is this: having been a product of local government, having known local government and having been in local government reform, we design councils so that they would be more viable around Victoria. The city based councils, which I think we should go a lot further with than we did, are basically wealthy entities. They are very well funded, whether they be Casey or whether they beâ</span>

                  </a>  Well, Dandenong has its issues, but it still has a very strong rate base. But it also has its problems with expenditure on social issues and other reasonable issues. But basically all the councils are quite wealthy, whereas all the councils in regional Victoria or outer Melbourne are struggling with two things. One is enormous growth in the outer suburban areas and the huge need for infrastructure to follow that program. The other is that they don't have the rate base that the city councils have. It's my view that none of this money should be spent on roads that have been in existence for many years and for which there have been enormous upgrades of the infrastructure around the city driven on by the state and local governments. One hundred per cent of this money should be going to the problems that the member for Indi just outlined on the Black Spur.</span>

                  </a>  Stop the press, call out the cavalry, do what needs to be done: this money from Roads to Recovery and other funds are spent in regional areas, but there should be a predominance. The member who brought this motion to the table talked about only 50 per cent of this money being actually allocated to regional and country areas. All of this money should be going to regional and country areas. The deaths described by the member for Indi, the deaths described by the member who spoke first and the deaths that happen in our own constituencies are issues that affect country people in a much greater way than they ever affect metropolitan people. The metropolitan councils also have the benefit, as they pay for their roads and as they develop these given areas, that the safety aspects are in these new roads. These regional roads are old roads that need the coverage of this Black Spot Program. I'm calling on all of us now to consider that our regional friends and our regional colleaguesâthe people who live in the regions, outside of the citiesâneed to be protected in exactly the same way in which we're doing our best for those who are in drought affected areas. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I have spoken many times in this place about the safety of the Princes Highway. As the main road connecting many communities along the coast, its local and economic importance cannot be overstated. But the highway is not the only road that is in desperate need of safety upgrades in my electorate. Local roads in regional areas can be impacted by a number of things, like our population quadrupling over the holidays. We are a farming and defence community. Tractors, trucks and other heavy equipment are regular users of our roads. We are proud of our industries and we rely on our holiday-makers, but our roads can sometimes bear the brunt of that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shoalhaven City Council has over 1,700 kilometres of council serviced roads to maintain, an expensive exercise by any estimation. The Black Spot Program is there to help councils make our roads safer, so we can try and reduce the ever-climbing national road toll. This program delivers strong road safety benefits, but it needs to have the right investment to achieve this goal, and there are real consequences for delays in that funding. All three councils in my electorate have applied for funding under the latest round of this program, and I want to talk a little about why these projects are so important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shoalhaven City Council has 13 projects on its wish list, totalling almost $7.9 million. I understand that council's top priority this year is to fix the Currarong Road. The campaign to fix this road has been running for years, and residents have been left disappointed in the past. The Currarong Community Association has been leading this campaign, and, sadly, we have recently seen yet more evidence of why this road needs to be fixed. Our community has been left devastated by the news that a 17-year-old man from Erowal Bay has been left in an induced coma following a crash on this road on 12 October. There is a tragic list of injuries to this poor young man, and a GoFundMe campaign that has been set up to help his family has had strong local support. This road is dangerous. It needs fixing, and I am pleased that this is a top priority for council. If successful, funding will be used to widen the road and install a shoulder and for other safety treatments on a stretch of road spanning between 7Â½  and 11Â½  kilometres. At a total project cost of $4.6 million, this project is expensive. That can make it harder to meet the benefit-cost ratio the program requires, but it doesn't lessen the urgency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another priority for council is Kangaroo Valley Road on Berri Mountain. Council wants $317,000 to install some fence line guideposts and rub rails to try and make the 12Â½  kilometres of this notorious road along the edge of the mountain safe. Council is also hoping to fund roundabouts at Currambene Street in Huskisson and Osborne Street in Nowra. Some of council's projects are more modest than others: $60,000 for design and investigation works at the corner of Osborne and North streets in Nowra, an intersection across from the local schoolâa small price to pay for our children's safety. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eurobodalla Shire Council has three projects on its wish list. Council is asking for $4.3 million for a protective right lane turn and traffic signals on Beach Road, Batemans Bay. Council also wants $3.8 million to realign the bends on George Bass Drive at Lilli Pilli, and $3 million to enhance the shoulders, improve the line markings and increase sight lines at Tomakin Road at Mogo. Recently, Kiama Municipal Council successfully updated Crooked River Road in Gerroa, with more than $97,000 from the program to install Raptor crash cushions and other safety measuresâa great example of the great things this program can do. This year, council is again asking for funding, with a focus on improving pedestrian safety in the area. These are all worthy projects, and it is obvious that the need in my electorate is great. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this program can save lives. We know that the road toll continues to soar, and across Australia it is higher today than it was four years ago. That's why I feel disheartened that the Morrison government continues to overpromise and underdeliver on the Black Spot Program: $123 million over the last five years has been underspent. Why? There is a huge need for this financial assistance in my community. No-one should have to face what the Currarong community is facing. No family should have to crowdfund so they can be with a loved one who has been critically injured on one of our roads. Let's hope that this year the government delivers what it promised. Our community cannot afford to wait.</span>

He's someone who is really passionate about road safety, and not just this motion but his behaviour in the party room and in this place generally is proof positive of that. He and I are both chairs of our respective state's black spot committees, a position I am very much honoured to hold, and it's one which calls upon us once a year to sit with various stakeholders in a very constructive, collaborative meeting where we determine allocation of this funding. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can go to the point the member for Gilmore made in error at the end of her contribution: I'm sure she didn't intend to suggest our government wasn't allocating funding to the Black Spot Program. In fact, funding to this program is a billion dollars over 10 years, and this year's annual funding goes from $60 million to $110 million, an increase of $50 million. She did point out that there's been an underspend. There's an underspend because this funding is provided to state governments, who go about undertaking the works, and in some cases, sadly, this work is not being done on the ground. There's no issue in terms of the allocation of these funds. The projects are funded, and I see it in the work I do in the black spot committee in South Australia. I have been incredibly disappointed with respect to one project, at Holder Top Road in Waikerie, which took not one but two years to break ground after we had approved the improvement of a dangerous intersection. That's where this issue is. Quite frankly, to point this out is really just to go and find statistical politicking and point-scoring. It's not becoming, quite frankly, in this debate. Nobody in this place wants to put Australians in harm's way in any endeavour. In fact, if it relates to road safety, I think we can all say across any aisle that it is a multiparty intention in this place to make road safety a very high priority. Of course, as a government, we're doing that not just in relation to the Black Spot Program; there's $100 billion worth of infrastructure projects being rolled out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation for this contribution, I asked for details of total federal government expenditure on the road network in my electorate since I had the privilege of being elected the member for Barker. I can tell the constituents of Barker that since I was elected in 2013 over $990 million has been expended on the road networks across my electorate. Almost $1 billion has come in to improve the road networks of Barker or is slated in the forward estimates to do so. I can point to $200 million for the Princes Highway and $70 million for the Renmark-to-Gawler section of the Sturt Highway. That is considerable funding in terms of the Black Spot Program. But, rather than spending this time highlighting each and every one of those projects, I can say, as someone who drives 100,000 kilometres in my electorate, that we need to do more. Governments need to do more. Local governments need to do more, state governments need to do more, and the federal government needs to continue to make a significant contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conducted over 40 community meetings during the course of the last year or so, and in all those community meetings I asked constituents: 'If there were one thing you could do to your road network to make it safer, what would you do?' On balance, we came to the resolution in each of those meetings that they wanted to see wider roads. Wider roads are safer roads, and I'm talking in particular now of a country electorate like mine. So over time I'd like to see us undertake a serious program of road widening across my electorate and, indeed, across all of our rural electorates. We know that it costs about $100,000 per kilometre to widen a road. That's a small fraction of the cost of resurfacing a road, and it has a significant impact in terms of reducing likely road fatalities. I commend this motion to this place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I'm a strong supporter of the federal Black Spot Program for regional roads. At more than 9,000 square kilometres, Mayo has a large road network and, sadly, a disproportionate number of South Australia's fatalities and serious accidents. A program that successfully identifies where often limited amounts of federal funding can save many lives and prevent serious injuries is, without a doubt, an excellent use of funds. However, for my electorate of Mayo, analysis has found that most of the federal government's chosen funding commitments have not necessarily matched where we have the greatest number of crashes and casualties. Now I recognise that a good black spot program will also seek to identify where crashes are likely to occur and prevent them before they happen, but the mismatch between the data and the funding commitments is sometimes challenging. As the federal member, I would greatly appreciate more transparency around that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although it is a little dated, the casualty crash data for Mayo for the five years between 2011 and 2015 identified three particularly bad intersections. The corner of Pfeiffer Road and the Woodside-Nairne Road, the corner of Nine Mile Road and Willyaroo Road between Strathalbyn and Willyaroo, and the corner of Main South Road and Norman Avenue in Normanville. The worst four stretches of road are the section of Mt Barker Road between Aldgate and Bridgewater, Birdwood Road between Gumeracha and Birdwood, Onkaparinga Road west of Mt Torrens, and Willunga Hill Road. Sadly, there are further dishonourable mentions. I've spoken about the perils of the Victor Harbor Road extensively in this place, as well as those of Main South Road between Myponga and Yankalilla. Sadly, Long Valley Road has seen many tragic, and quite recent, accidents in my community. The state government continues to promise it's going to act, with a review. We're yet to see the findings from that review, and I hope that their inaction will not cost any more lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that our country roads are funded and fixed. It's not too often I agree with the member for Barker, but I certainly think a widening program would be particularly valuable, particularly because we have so many cyclists on our roads now. We have cyclists and trucks together, and the two combined are often a tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention the intersection between Old Princes Highway and the Woodside-Nairne Road, which, while less likely to cause death and serious injuries, is still a dangerous spot, because vehicles bank up over the railway line and there are morning commuters. It's an issue that's happening for years in Nairne and one that many of us avoid, but sometimes, if you live right near there, you cannot avoid that. In the last South Australian election, the state government promised to upgrade the intersection and, while survey work has been done, there are no plans on the table for the promised community consultation. I really urge the state government to work on that. I know the local member, the member for Kavel, has been particularly vocal on this matter, and that's what's important: state and local members talking about what's needed in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will mention the on and off ramps that need to be extended on the South Eastern Freeway. Sadly, they too can be deadly, with slip lanes being particularly short with the uphill merges. I continue in this place to advocate very strongly for federal government funding for the Verdun interchange to be a properly upgraded bidirectional interchange as well as ensuring we can have a timely start to the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment to Mayo for an additional lane on the freeway between Crafers and Stirling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to reassure my electorate that I will continue to push for ongoing supplementary road funding for South Australia. This remains a deeply critical source of funding for our state's local roads. Centre Alliance's advocacy has already returned $80 million in supplementary road funding to South Australia. This is for our regional roads, and approximately $9.2 million of that goes directly to Mayo. Anyone who lives rurally sadly knows people that we have lost in our community. In Mayo we have black markers and we have red markers, and all of those people are loved and deeply missed by their family. They're often young people. In our community we have huge gum trees that, while they look beautiful on our big roads, are, sadly, very unforgiving. I encourage, in particular, young people and P-platers to drive carefully on our rural roads. Your mum and dad will miss you too much. I commend this program. I'm so grateful the federal government puts funding into our rural roads.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  As previous speakers have mentioned, we lose far too many people on our roads. In Western Australia, with the enormous distances that we travel, we see a disproportionate number of people lose their lives on country roads. The road toll in Western Australia reflects that around 50 per cent of the people who die on our roads die on country roads, and only 20 per cent of the population lives in regional areas. So as I say, a disproportionate number of people die on our country roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm very pleased that the Australian government has committed an extra $50 million per year to our road Black Spot Program. That will take the annual allocation from $60 million to $110 million. For WA, with that money distributed proportionally, that will see around $13Â½ million allocated to Western Australian roads. Under the funding formula, 50 per cent of that money has to be allocated to rural roads, so we'll see around $6 million to $7 million allocated to our rural road network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we saw some good projects funded. The South Coast Highway between Albany and Denmark saw money allocated for a slip road at the turn-off to Young Siding, and I was also very pleased to tell my great mate, Nat Manton, the CEO of the Corrigin Shire, that there were two projects within the Corrigan Shire totalling together $650,000, which the shire will be able to upgrade. So we've been doing some good work, and I'm pleased to say that the assistant minister, Scott Buchholz, has appointed me as the chair of the Western Australian committee for allocating this funding. I look forward to early in the year meeting with the agencies involved: Western Australia Main Roads, the RAC and other agencies that are on that body. We'll be meeting in late January or early February to allocate this year's funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some numbers on the success of the program so far. It's estimated that over 10 years there'll be 2,400 projects funded, around 280 lives saved and up to 14,400 crashes prevented. It's a very worthy project, I'm sure you would agree, Acting Deputy Speaker Wallace. It's vitally important that the community is involved in nominating these black spots. So I would say to all of my constituents, where you see an issue, where you see an intersection or a section of road that you think is dangerous and may well lead to an accident in future, then, please, nominate that black spot and let the committee know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about a couple of other road projects, which are very much related to road safety but not necessarily under the Black Spot Program. Under the urban infrastructure fundâthe congestion busting fund, as it's come to be knownâthere's $140 million from the Commonwealth government towards the Albany Ring Road project. In my home town of Albany we have a major intersection, a five-exit roundabout, which sees people in very small vehicles, particularly elderly drivers, interacting with three-trailer road trains. About a million tonnes of grain freight comes through that roundabout, and probably another half a million tonnes of woodchips, so there are a lot of very large trucks interacting withâ</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the Albany Ring Road is critical to take these heavy trucks, as I said up to three trailers, out of that roundabout and away from the residential traffic and get them out of the town.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other significant projectâthere are actually many significant projectsâis The Outback Way, which is the road from Laverton to Winton in Queensland. It's through the outback, passes Uluru and goes through my electorate for nearly 1,000 kilometres, and particularly through the towns of Warburton and Warakurna on the way to the Northern Territory border. We've invested, in total now, I think about $160 million in the project. The reason that that's important is that there are about 1,600 kilometres of gravel and there any many people who are using that roadâtourists and othersâand tragically this week two motorcyclists were killed in separate incidents. Thank you very much.</span>

He, like me, is passionate about black spots in our local electorate and making sure that our residents get home sooner and safer. This was key election of commitment to the people of Ryan at the last election, that I would do everything in my power to advocate for additional infrastructure funding for them to ensure that they and their families were safe and were freer of congestion than they are today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the member for Wide Bay's motion as an opportunity to talk a little bit about the importance of black spot funding and some of the local projects that I have going on in my area. But before I get into the detail of that, let's not be confused about Labor's lack of support for fixing infrastructure and black spots in their local areas. We've heard a lot of nice words from Labor members opposite as part of this debate, but we also hear lots of words in the chamber like, for example, when they were deriding minister Tudge just recently when he was talking about the importance of fixing local roundabouts, which are black spotsâ</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SIMMONDS:</span>
                  </a>  I take the interjections from Labor members, who were again just now deriding the fact he was fixing a roundabout. These are the local black spots that are so important to our community members. The roundabout in question is in fact a local black spot. There have been over 16 accidents in the last five years, 11 of which required hospitalisations, seven of which where people were very seriously injured. For Labor members opposite to simply deride it as a local roundabout just goes to show how out of touch they are with the Australian people, who are looking to the government to make sure that these kinds of black spots and safety issues are fixed within their local areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise the Labor members opposite would deride something like fixing local congestion, because they don't believe in investing in roads. They don't want to do it. They've shown time and time again what they're more interested is the social engineering of forcing behavioural change and getting people out of their cars, forcing people to leave their cars, whether it's via congestion tax or simply failing to invest in the local infrastructure that enables people to use their roads in a non-congested way. They're trying to force people onto other forms of transport, or to get out of their car, whatever it is. The Labor Party is about removing choices for people, rather than investing in the local infrastructure that allows families to make the decisions that are best for them, to make the decisions that suit their families the best and allow them to enjoy a good and strong quality of life. That is why it is so important for the Morrison government that we're investing in infrastructure, particularly in the Black Spot Program, not because it's an end in itselfâit's no surprise that every politician loves cutting a ribbon; I won't deny that. But at the end of the day we invest in this infrastructure not because we can, not because it is there, but because we're helping everyday families. Because every bit of infrastructure that we upgrade allows them to spend more time at home with their families, allows them to do more sport or things on the weekend, allows them to get home safer so that no family has to go through the experience of getting a call late at night from the police that something has happened to a significant loved one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Spot Program is particularly important in this regard, because it targets those bits of infrastructure which have a demonstrated record of being unsafe. As part of the local and state government Road Safety Package, announced in the 2019-20 budget, the Australian government has committed an a additional $50 million per year for the Black Spot Program in 2019-20. I know from experience as a local councillor just how important this funding is for local councils, to be able to partner with the federal government, to achieve real outcomes on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has, in fact, provided a billion dollars to the Black Spot Program between the 2013-14 financial year and the 2023 financial year, with an ongoing commitment of $110 million for each following year. As I said, it's an important part of the National Road Safety Strategy. The strategy's vision is to challenge the perception that serious injury or death is just an inevitable cost of road travelâit is not. We can and should do better. We should ensure we are doing everything to keep our roads as safe as they can possibly be and that they're maintained to a high standard. It's important the community gets involved in nominating local intersections or bits of road that can be dangerous, where serious crashes have occurred, that can be part of this program. I'll be encouraging local Ryan residents to do exactly that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms McBRIDE:</span>
                  </a>  I move this motion because as a pharmacist, the only pharmacist in this place, I am dismayed by the Minister for Health's shameless politicisation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by spruiking the listing of new drugs and then claiming the credit. It occurred again this weekend with the long overdue listing of Symdeko, seven months after it was approved. As Niki Savva points out in Plots and Prayers: 'Previous health ministers would release the names of listed drugs en masse during the working week with little fanfare, receiving little or no publicity. Hunt knew how to get attention.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my view that a PBS listingâthat is, the subsidising of a medicineâshould not be turned into a political stunt or self-promotion event. Listings are in the interest of public health and they matter. They should not be reduced to a photo opportunity for a political agenda. It is worth noting that the minister's public 'announcements' don't deliver a single clinical outcome. These are delivered by the hardworking research scientists, by industry and by clinicians. Other health ministers haven't engaged in this sort of fanfare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in my career, new medicines were routinely listed on the PBS at set intervals. One of my jobs was to make sure the floppy disk had been installed and the PBS updates had been applied in the community pharmacy where I worked. That was it. But if the minister must take credit for each new listing he must also take responsibility for the growing delays and failure to list medications which have been recommended by the independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Labor's record on the PBS, unlike that of those opposite, is rock solid. From its introduction by the Chifley government in 1948 in the face of strong opposition, including a High Court challenge, through to the first safety nets of the Hawke government in 1986, it is something that we on this side of the chamber can be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I gave notice of this motion in early September we were aware of some 20 medications that had not been listed, despite having been recommended by the PBAC. Since then the PBAC has made public its recommendations from the July meeting, which took the total number of drugs waiting to be listed by Minister Hunt to almost 60. These are drugs that have been recommended for listing by the independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, because they stack up on both clinical and cost grounds. Australians who are sick deserve to have a medication which has been approved by the PBAC listed as soon as possible. But this just isn't happening. At the same time the government's recent budget updates showed a $155 million underspend on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's failure to act on PBAC recommendations to list medications in a timely manner or to list them at all is not the only barrier to Australians accessing affordable medicines. The government's own figures show that many Australians don't fill prescriptions because they just can't afford them. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to cost. The rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas as it is in the least disadvantaged areas, meaning that the cost of medicines is contributing to health inequality in Australia todayâand that's assuming that you can see a doctor to get a prescription.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New Medicare figures confirm what Australians already know, that the out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor is higher than ever before. The government's own data shows that the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP is $39.55, up $10.40 or 36 per cent since the Liberals were elected. The same is true for the cost of seeing a specialist. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a specialist is now $91.50, up a staggering $33.40 or 58 per cent since the Liberals were elected. These costs are pushing household budgets to breaking point. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfareâthe government's own expertsâsay that 1.3 million Australians a year delay or avoid Medicare services due to cost. That's just not good enough. It's worth repeating: in a country that prides itself on universal access to health care, over a million people every year can't afford basic essential health care. The minister has repeatedly promised that if a medicine is recommended for listing by the experts, that if a medicine is recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, that he will list it. That is just not true, and it's not good enough. The minister can't spruik drug listings and claim the credit for them. It's not okay.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  Thank you to the member for Dobell for bringing forward this important debate. I have mentioned before about Bennelong being the capital of innovation. We have some of the most cutting edge companies in the world. We've invented things that make your life better, from wi-fi to the Granny Smith apple. One of the biggest drivers of this innovation is the pharmaceutical companies. Most of them are based in Macquarie Park in Bennelong, so many that it is commonly referred to as 'Pill Hill'. From these, over a dozen companies, come many of the drugs that are listed annually and are saving lives daily, thanks to the PBS. The PBAC considers and recommends medicines for listing on the PBS three times a year, and critically this government has a policy to list all positive recommendations on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From October 2013 to 1 September 2019, 2,185 new or amended items have been listed on the PBS. In 2012-13, the average was 321 days from PBAC recommendation to approval. But, last year, this was down to an average of 189 days. Obviously we can still get these numbers down further, but I think it's important to recognise the efforts that have already been made in this area and government's efforts to make this better for companies and, more importantly, for their patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this weekend Minister Hunt announced that patients can gain access to Symdeko and Orkambi immediately, with the manufacturer agreeing to the government's request to provide early access until the medicine is listed on the PBS on 1 December. This is expected to provide new or improved treatment options for over 1,400 patients. People might otherwise have to pay up to $250,000 a year for Symdeko or Orkambi. These two are amongst the 32 new and amended listings made by the government per month, approximately one per day. This is at an overall cost of around $10.6 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst these dozens of listings are a number of local 'Pill Hill' contributions. These include Apotex, which received a listing for flucloxacillin for treatment of serious staphylococcal infection and osteomyelitis. In 2018, more than 525,000 patients accessed a previously available brand of antibiotic for this condition and may now benefit from this new listing. And memorably, back on 1 June 2018, the government committed to $241.3 million for Spinraza, made by a local company Biogen. This is a life changing medicine that treats the devastating illness of spinal muscular atrophy. Without subsidy, patients would pay more than $367,000 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, since October 2013, the government has approved more than 100 new and amended listings for cancer on the PBS at an expected cost of more than $6.6 billion over the forward estimates. Local contributions to the cancer space include some really exciting innovations. MSD's Keytruda is an immunotherapy that could change the game for cancer treatment. It has already been listed for patients with local or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer, saving 430 patients over $91,000 per course of treatment, and many more will benefit as its listings grow. A newcomer to Bennelong, Merck, has had Bavencio listed, at a cost of over $81 million, for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and highly aggressive type of skin cancer. This will save 160 patients close to $150,000 a year. In 2019 under the PBS patients will pay a maximum of $40.30 per script, with concessional patients, including pensioners, paying just $6.50. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is continuing to meet its commitment to invest in new medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The government will list all medicines that are recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The industry has seen some tough legislative times in recent years, but thanks to an agreement signed by Medicines Australia and the dedication of our current excellent health minister, the future is looking bright for patients who need to access cutting-edge medicines. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I rise to support this important motion put forward by my colleague the member for Dobell about affordable access to medicines when Australians need them. I want to adopt what my colleague, the only pharmacist in this place, saidâthat access to affordable medicines and health care shouldn't be a political stunt. It's above politics because it's about egalitarian access to health care, universal health care. It's really one of the great manifestations of one of the most fundamental of Australian valuesâfairness. It's something that we in this country are rightly proud of, and it's something that we have to hold precious and hold dear and fight to protect. The promise of universal health care is the promise of an egalitarian societyâa society where, no matter how much money you have in the bank, how much money you earn, or even if you don't earn any money at all, if you are sick, you know that you'll have access to the best medical care, including the best medicines. When you're sick, the last thing you need to be worried about is how you're going to be able to afford to go to the doctor, to see the specialist or to buy the medicine, which in many cases is life-saving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1948, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, proudly introduced by a Labor government, has been one of the most important elements of Australia's universal healthcare system, along with that other great Labor reform, the Medicare system. We know that the aims of the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, are to ensure timely access to medicines that Australians need at a cost the individual and the community can afford, and also to make sure that medicines meet appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. It is really important that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the work of PBAC, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, are not politicised, are not used as a weapon against the other side, and they're allowed to go about doing their job; and when PBAC says, 'These medicines should be put on the PBS,' then that's what happens. As the member for Dobell said, if the health minister wishes to claim credit for every drug that is put on the PBS, then he has to accept responsibility for the fact that there are 60 drugs which have been recommended by PBAC to put on the PBS which are not thereânot only drugs that would improve the quality of life for many Australians who need it but drugs that in many cases would prolong and save Australians' lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also drugs that the Australian government needs to put on other schemes. One of them is flash continuous glucose monitoring. Despite the shadow minister for health tabling a petition of some 214,000 signatures requesting the Minister for Health to list the flash glucose monitor on the NDSS as soon as possible, it is not on the NDSS. That means that people like my constituent Jacqui can't afford to pay for it. Jacqui is very lucky that she's been put on a trial of FreeStyle Libre with Frankston Hospital. She came in to see me and told me how flash continuous glucose monitoring has changed her life as a diabetic. It has allowed her to undergo daily activities that most of us take for granted and to monitor her health and wellbeing. She came to see me and said: 'Peta, I'm not just here for myself. In fact, I'm predominantly not here for myself. I'm here for all the other diabetics who are out there whose lives have been a constant battle just to have stability. I want them to have access to whatever they need so that they can be a contributing member of society and can feel that they're a contributing member of society.' I join those 214,000 Australians and the shadow minister for health and call on Minister Hunt to get flash glucose monitoring on the NDSS as soon as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;" />
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">We know that out-of-pocket costs for health care have gone up and up. We have Australians living with flat and stagnant wages, with rising household expenses and rising out-of-pocket costs for health care. We know that those who are the most disadvantaged, those who are struggling the hardest to get by, are the ones who are going without when it comes to health care. That is not good enough. That is undermining the promise of universal health care, and, like every other member of the Labor caucus in this federal parliament, I will stand up as often as I can to say we must fight for it and not let it be undermined.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I'm very proud to be talking to this motion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Everyone in this room recognises that it is a wonderful system that was brought in by none other than Ben Chifley, as the member for Macarthur has pointed out. No-one disputes that; it is a great system. And, since 2013, it has gone ahead in leaps and bounds. I'll just outline some of the things that have been achieved, and then I'll correct the record on some of the distortions of fact that are appearing on the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, we have listed 2,100âin fact, there are now 2,102âitems on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since we were given the responsibility of running government in 2013. That's an exceptional golden period of new drugs. The latest ones that were listed on the weekend were for cystic fibrosis, the dual listing of Symdeko and Orkambi. I don't know of any other jurisdiction that subsidises the cost of these wonderful, life-changing drugs for people who are born with cystic fibrosis. We've also lowered the age at which it becomes available, down to the age of two. Previously, you could only access one of these drugs once you were over the age of five.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For lung cancerâone of the commonest and probably the most fatal of the solid organ cancersâwe've got Keytruda, Tecentriq and Avastin. Now for those last two, it's $189,000 for a course. For Keytruda, it's $90,000 for a course. We've added treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Sprycel; there are new drugs for ovarian cancer, for heart disease, for asthma, and the list goes on and on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, clause (2) of this motion refers to the government not listing 20 drugs. I have checked with the minister's office, and he has in turn checked with the department. The department is not a political animal; it's a deliverer of the great health system that we have. There are noâI'll just get the exact words, so I'm not misquoting. The department says, 'The PBS schedule will shortly be updated to reflect a number of additional medicines that will be listed on the PBS on 1 November.' What they are referring to is the PBAC. It makes it's recommendations; it does that three times a year. There is a delay between when it recommends it andâthere's correspondence sent to the makers of these drugs. There was recently a nine-month delay for one drug before the overseas company agreed to the listing conditions; it took nine days from that letter being received to these last couple of drugs being listed. So it's a pretty quick system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's in the budget papers and it's on the public record, but there can be delays. In 2011 the then Labor health minister, Nicola RoxonâI give her marks for being honestâsaid:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately I think the important point is that we can't in every instance guarantee that a drug will be listed immediately because there are financial consequences for doing that â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, for some of the drugs that had been recommended, there was a willing seller, but there just wasn't money in the budget. That was for severe asthma; COPD, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; endometriosis; IVF treatment; and some schizophrenia drugs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very proud record of delivering for the people of Australia. You do have to manage your budget, because we have high-cost medication listings across the board. They do cost a lot of money, but those cystic fibrosis drugs will actually add, on average, 20 extra years of life to people who are born now and who start these wonderful drugs, which improve their lung function, at an early age. All the thick mucus damages their lungs and their pancreas and affects their bowel. All that will be limited. They will be better nourished. Their lungs will work. They will have a much better outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be celebrating the wonderful system that we have in this country. We have managed our budgetary pressures well. We are listing, at the moment, all the ones that have been recommended and the companies we've responded to have been listed, which is a pretty amazing outcome. What a turnaround since 2013.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  One thing I will not do tonight is politicise the argument about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The history is well known to everyone in this place. I think it is absolutely disgraceful that the present health minister is politicising what for 70 years has been a bipartisan scheme, and I will not do that. I've been very pleased to speak on the motion moved by my good friend the member of Dobell. She is someone who has worked as a hospital pharmacist for many years. I'd like to thank the member for bringing this important matter before the chamber and I associate myself with her words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank my friends from the other side of parliament, the member for Bennelong and the member for Lyne, for speaking on this motion, together with the other speakers. In the motion, the member of Dobell has hit the nail on the head. It has been the longstanding practice of successive governments to accept and act on the advice of independent expertsâthe Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committeeâwhen listing medicines on the PBS. If we don't do that, we end up having an arms race of lobbyists who lobby for these respective medications. That is something that we must not do. It also leads us to an exploitative manipulation of our patients. As a doctor, one who has prescribed medications listed on the PBS for now over 40 years, I think that that is the last thing we should be doing. I think it's a great shame that the current health minister has attempted to do this. What we need are evidence based ways of prescribing medications, and that's what the PBAC does with the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to what the member for Lyne has said, we don't really know what the long-term benefits of some of these newer listings will be. It appears in the short term that medications such as Kalydeco and Symdeko for children with cystic fibrosis will extend their lives, but there is not enough accumulated evidence to really know that in the longer term. We rely on short-term evidence and the advice of experts to decide whether we should list these drugs. Cystic fibrosis is a dreadful, horrible disease, and any parent who has a child with cystic fibrosis knows what they have to go through. Certainly, at the present time, life expectancy is relatively short, although it is much better than when I started as a paediatric resident in the children's hospital in 1979. We hope that these newer medications will improve lifestyles and life length in the long term, but we really don't know the exact ways and the exact end point. That's why we rely on the advice of experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over recent years, we also have become accustomed to seeing this health minister grandstand and congratulate himself each and every time the government follows the independent advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and I think that's a great shame. The PBS has enjoyed bipartisan support since it began in 1948. As has already been mentioned, it was started by the Chifley Labor government. As a doctor, I cannot underestimate the significance that the PBS has had on our society since its inception in assisting Australians to access affordable medicines. I want that to continue, and I want it to continue in a bipartisan way. We're now being faced with an absolute tsunami of new medications and new treatments. That will ramp up with the development of the new biologic and genetically targeted medications. I think that KEYTRUDA has already been listed as one, but there are many thousands that will need to be looked at and decisions made about their listing in the next few years. That number is increasing every day, even as I speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a bipartisan, fair and equitable way of deciding which medications to list and which we don't. The health minister sometimes delays listing because of cost pressures. Recently, there was the example of a treatment which was a multipronged catheter for use in a condition called atrial fibrillation. I knowâand the minister told meâthat they would delay the listing because of the cost pressures. So to get up there and say that because their budget is going so well et cetera is why they list things is rubbish. We act on independent advice, we act on advice that is given to the minister and to the PBS, and that's how it should stay. We should stop exploiting patients.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I am pleased to speak on this motion today, because it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the fantastic work our government is doing in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison Liberal government has a strong record of delivering more medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and making those medicines more accessible and more affordable for Australians. We are listing all medicines that are recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on the PBS as a matter of policy. Since 2013, our policy has resulted in approximately 2,200 new or amended medical listings on the PBS, valued at around $10.6 billion. This is an average of around 30 new or amended listings per month, or approximately one per day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday, the health minister announced the addition of cystic fibrosis medicine SYMDEKO for patients over the age of 12 with specific gene mutations. The minister also announced that the listing for the medicine ORKAMBI would be expanded for children between the ages of two and five years old. This is expected to provide new or improved treatment options for over 1,400 people who might otherwise pay up to $250,000 a year. We are also helping 3,000 women with breast cancer by subsidising the medicine KISQALI, which, without subsidy, can cost more than $71,000 per year. We are also subsidising SPINRAZA for Australian children with spinal muscular atrophy, which would otherwise cost these families more than $367,000 a year. Clearly, that is completely out of reach for pretty much every single Australian. The cost of accessing these medicines without subsidy would just be completely prohibitive for these individuals and for these families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: these listings make a life-changing difference to these people who need the medicines, to their families and to their friends. That's why our government is committed to continuing our strong record of making more medicines available to more people. In order to do this, we are lowering the PBS safety net threshold amounts for concessional and general patients and their families from 1 January 2020. This will benefit up to around 1.6 million concessional patients and 129,000 general patients, allowing them to reach the PBS safety net sooner and reducing their out-of-pocket costs. We can do all of this because of our government's strong economic management. When we have a strong economy we can afford to invest in essential services like hospitals, like Medicare and like the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have to look back too far, unfortunately, to understand the impact of poor economic management on delivering medicines to those who need them. Last time the Labor government, those opposite, were in government they reversed the policy of the coalition to list all medicines approved by the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, because they couldn't manage the economy. On 25 February 2011, Labor announced the unprecedented deferral of the listing of seven medicines under the PBS for conditions such as severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, IVF treatment and schizophrenia. In 2011, Labor's then health minister, Nicola Roxon, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately I think the important point is that we can't in every instance guarantee that a drug will be listed immediately because there are financial consequences for doing that â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, due to their own financial mismanagement Labor stopped listing medicines approved by the PBAC in an attempt to cut costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is yet another attempt by Labor to play politics with an issue of critical importance to so many Australians, but it does, however, give me an opportunity to remind those opposite of some facts about the process for the addition of medicines to the PBS for the benefit of so many Australians. By law, the government cannot list a medicine on the PBS unless it has been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC meet three times per year to consider and recommend medicines for listing on the PBS. The time it takes for a medicine to be listed following a PBAC recommendation is usually determined by the approach of the sponsoring pharmaceutical company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by saying that the PBS needs a responsible government managing a strong economy, and that is exactly what the Liberal Morrison government is delivering.</span>

                  </a>  The National Broadband Network has well and truly arrived in my electorate of Boothby. Thanks to our government, more than 95,500 premises in my community are ready for service and almost 54,000 are already connected to the NBN. Nationally, the NBN is now available to more than 10.6 million homes and businesses, with over 5.8 million active connections providing fast and affordable internet across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those connections belongs to Gary Paradise and his team at Concept Data, a fantastic local business in my electorate, in the suburb of Torrens Park. Concept Data are providing innovative IT solutions to clients and using the National Broadband Network to do so. I recently visited Concept Data with the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts and representatives from the NBN Co to hear direct from Gary about how their connection to the NBN means they can deliver a better service for their customer base, which includes some of South Australia's biggest brand names. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognise the minister for his commitment to listening to the experiences of business owners like Gary and for the minister's hard work to resolve the NBN rollout challenges that we inherited from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is connecting more users to the NBN every two weeks than Labor connected in six years of government. I'll just repeat that: we're connecting more people to the NBN every two weeks than those opposite managed to connect in six years of government. Those opposite, the former Labor government, missed every rollout target they set themselves and they connected just 51,000 premises to the fixed-line network in six years. Labor's fibre-to-the premises NBN policy would have cost $30 billion more and taken six to eight years longer to complete. This would have increased broadband bills by up to $500 per year. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to pass just two per cent of Australian premises. The rollout was so badly managed that contractors downed tools and stopped construction work in four states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast, all Australians will be able to connect to the NBN by 2020 under the coalition government. In regional Australia, the NBN rollout is over 99 per cent complete or under construction, and in metro areas the rollout is more than 93 per cent complete or under construction. We're now rolling out a multitechnology mix just like the USA, UK, Germany, France and many other countries. This multitechnology mix will include fibre to the node, fibre to the curb, fibre to the premises, HFC, fixed wireless and satellite. We're rolling out better broadband across Australia in the fastest and most affordable way so Australians can get access to fast broadband sooner at a price they can afford. The coalition's changes to the NBN rollout have saved taxpayers around $30 billion, avoided a $43 increase in monthly internet bills and will connect all Australians six to eight years sooner. As you can see, our government is delivering on our commitment and delivering NBN for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, unfortunately, we continue to see misinformation and false claims made in this place and in the media about the rollout of NBN. I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify some of this information, as it directly relates to my community. In August, it was reported in the media that suburbs in my electorate, including Somerton Park,  Glengowrie, Darlington, Warradale, Oaklands Park, Sturt, Seacombe Gardens, Glenelg, Glenelg North, Glenelg South and Marino, were in NBN limbo. Understandably, this was of great concern to me and residents in my local area, and, as a result, I immediately contacted the minister seeking clarification about the claims. I'm pleased to inform the House today that I've been advised by NBN Co that the majority of premises in my community, specifically in the suburbs I have just listed, are live and ready for service. If you break down the suburbs I have just noted, all but one are live. The majority of these connections were made in 2017-18, and the remaining module will be connected and ready for service by May 2020. NBN Co is working closely to resolve any connection difficulties experienced by individual households and businesses in these areas. I ask anyone needing further assistance to contact my office for helpâyou are most welcome to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I thank the member for Boothby for moving this motion, as it gives me a chance to talk about the disaster that the NBN has been for many residents of Werriwa. Despite the spin, the NBN is a hotchpotch patchwork of a multitechnology mix that will rely on a very aged copper network well into the future. In fact, the copper wires in my suburb have been there for 58 years. This is not a network built for the future; it is a scattergun approach that has been put together by the Liberal government. When the NBN was planned by the Labor Party, it was a network that enabled fibre-to-the-premises connections for nearly all Australians. For those who have that connection, which was provided in the early rollout in my electorate, they have brilliant, high-speed connections. Unfortunately, too few have fibre to the premises. What they do have is slow, unreliable internet connections reliant on copper connectionâif they have an NBN connection at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rollout is ongoing and delayed in Werriwa. Take the suburb of Long Point. Long Point is a suburb in the bushland along the Georges River, and it is heavily reliant on stable connections to the internet so it can be made aware of bushfires and so forth. Long Point is also just one example of many in my electorate and around the country of the failure of the rollout and the multitechnology mix. The people of Long Point have experienced frequent delays that have plagued the installation of the NBN over this small suburb of just three streets. Emails from NBN Co tell of the expected rollout to Long Point in the latter half of 2017. Yet, today in 2019, only a portion of the suburb is actually connected. That's right: it's two years later and most people in that suburb are still waiting for their NBN connection. The latest problem, I'm told, is an infrastructure shortfall that is expected to be fixed by 2020. The NBN has provided the following explanation to me: 'This service area appears to be ready for the service, and most premises will receive NBN by fibre-to-the-node or HFC technology. There are a small number of premises within the fibre-to-the-node footprint that are unable to receive a connection.' The email continues: 'In this instance, the distance of some of these premises from the NBN network means we can't connect properly, in the same way as we have connected others, because of the length of the copper. The signal degrades over distance, and it wouldn't be possible to achieve a service that meets the minimum requirements. At this stage, the expected service availability date is January 2020.' So, three years after Long Point was originally scheduled for connection, some of the residents may get internet speeds of 25 megabits per secondâhardly First World speeds for 15 kilometres away from Liverpool, and another example of why copper is not one of the best options. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have constituents who often have to go outside to find higher ground just to make phone calls. We have parents who are worried that a lack of internet access will mean their kids will fall behind in school, and there are university students who can't access multimedia and upload assignments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN Co's own figures from February this year show that while the number of premises connected has increased by 38 per cent, speeds were still slow and certainly not up to standard. Australia is now ranked 62nd in the world in internet speeds, falling yet another three spots since 2018. The Ookla speedtest global index has Australia behind Kazakhstan and Cape Verde. It was the Liberal government that moved the majority of the network to fibre to the node, forcing the majority of users to rely on the aged copper network. It was then in 2016, under the same Liberal government, that fibre to the kerb was announced as another way to deliver the NBN, again relying on copper wiring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The internet is meant to connect people through technology, not unite communities and connect people through sheer frustration at the complete failure of government policy. It's sad that in 20 years' time my constituents will still be relying on the copper network, a network that slows or becomes unusable just because it rains, a network that becomes nearly unusable just because it's between 7.00 pm and 10.00 pm at night and the copper lines can't deal with the connection. Patchwork quilts won't serve a community, patchwork quilts won't deliver high-speed internet and patchwork quilts actually have a purpose and it's not for the delivery of NBN. The government really does need to do better.</span>

                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  I begin by thanking the member for Boothby for the opportunity to speak on this motion and moving it for discussion in the Federation Chamber, least because it's important to have an honest conversation about the National Broadband Network. Deputy Speaker, I don't want to leave you under any illusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when Kevin Rudd first came up with the idea. When he thought the best thing that he could do was inject a giant monopoly into infrastructure investment, actively discouraging private investment and telecommunication companies to invest in a network to make sure that Australians had high-speed internet and to say, 'No, no, the government knows best.' I remember that moment and thinking, 'This isn't going to go so well.' And the reality is that is the legacy of the Labor Party and its National Broadband Network in the years it was in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over years, despite the number of written-down notes on the back of aeroplane napkinsâwritten between abusing flight attendant staffâthe reality is that in the six years of the previous Labor government just 51,000 users were connected to the NBN. To put that in perspective, it's a third of the Goldstein electorate. What they thought, with the hubris and the arrogance that sat behind their agenda, was that by dissuading and discouraging private investment they would lead, and somehow be able to build, this perfect utopia. It's a monument to the failure of socialism in one project. They will always stand condemned because Australians have had worse internet, because of their legacy, ever since, and our job has been to fix their failure. I get angry about this, because when you get the chairman of Telstra coming out and saying, 'If you hadn't have gone down this mad path from the get go, Australians would have had better, cheaper, faster internet.' They actively encouraged the digital divide because of their hubris and their arrogance. Some of us need to call it out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we have been in government we have, at every step, been fixing their mess. Under the Liberal-National coalition government over 60,000 premises are being connected to the NBN every two weeks. You compare that to 51,000 over the entire life of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government and you see the exposed sham of their agenda and why we need to stand up and be clear. But it doesn't change the fact that their active discouragement of private investment, their active dissuasion of getting Australians to invest in the future of internet technology in our country, still has lasting impacts. Every day I talk to constituents who have to deal with the consequences of Labor's bad policy decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have more than 10 million homes and businesses connected to the National Broadband Network and we need to continue the rollout. Now we have to make sure that everybody has access to the sorts of technologies that we have. That's why we congratulate the government on its legacy of fixing Labor's failure and fixing the problems that they created which meant that they actively discouraged private investment into the sector. This government, at every point, has shown that prudence and responsibility can still be in vogue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health has undertaken a survey of men's sheds to determine how many require a defibrillator. A competitive procurement process informed by the outcomes of the survey will now commence to determine a suitable supplier.

In future defibrillators will be available through the National Shed Development Programme (NSDP). Defibrillators have previously been available under the NSDP from Round 9 (2014) up to and including Round 18 (2019).</span>
