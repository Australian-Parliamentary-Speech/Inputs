Privately owned EVs spend on average, 10 to 12 hours overnight on charge using electricity from the grid. They are contributing 70 to 80 hours of coal fired emissions into the environment every week just to get people to work and back. More extensive trips require even more charging and using high-capacity chargers just makes the situation worse. Compared to fuel driven vehicles which travel an average of an hour per day getting people to work and back, which are putting 7 or so hours per week of well controlled fuel emissions into the environment each week. 70 to 80 hours per week as compared to 7 hours per week. Anyone who cares about the environment would not drive an EV.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A lack of vision by the Government, when introducing much-needed legislative change in 2002, has thrown countless Australians into legal limbo regarding their citizenship status. Australian citizens who acquired a second citizenship before 2002 have fallen foul of s17. Most who acquired another citizenship probably did so for cultural reasons, and for ease of travel to—and temporary residency in—a nation to which they almost certainly had close, familial ties. To have elected to acquire a second citizenship should not be interpreted as an indication such a person no longer wished to be Australian. Yet this is precisely the erroneous view taken by the Australian Government of the day, and not corrected by any subsequent Government.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">• The 2015 and subsequent amendments evidence the Government recognises the threshold for stripping an Australian of their Australian citizenship is higher than simply holding another citizenship. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Not taking steps to remedy this situation leads to other issues, including:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not—and cannot—know who is affected by this. Many affected people themselves are unaware. The current situation is not tenable and would be remedied by the repeal of s17 with retrospective effect.</span>

The risk of serious adverse advents has been shown to be higher than vaccine's which have been rejected for use in the past such as the Swine Flu vaccine (1976) and Rotavirus Vaccine (1999). Therefore, it is inhumane and simply wrong to continue use of these vaccines until further analysis of new data can be performed. At present, there is potential unacceptable risk to the Australian Public associated with the current Sars-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines. </span>

Interest rate rises or cuts have minimal impact on the AUD, meaning a broader approach can be utilised when dealing with inflation or stimulating the economy. A compulsory savings mechanism for high income individuals (Meaning they have less to spend in the economy, causing inflation to cool), would give the RBA an additional tool. If, in the future our economy slows, these high income individuals would gain access to their savings, stimulating the economy.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current climate of the justice system for sexual violence survivors is shrouded in victim-blaming, stigma towards men and minorities and a lack of understanding for how to navigate conversations in a trauma-informed way. The justice system is incredibly retraumatising, and there is a lack of understanding about dissociative amnesia in regards to cases- the process by which survivors block out trauma- and how the brain responds to danger. There is a lack of comprehensive information for police, which is bountifully available for mental health clinicians, but not those who deal with both the perpetrator and victim. I implore that training covers how to validate and provide autonomy to survivors—including psychologist-approved and survivor-approved training and exams into conversations. Conversation guides would include phrasing such as "I believe you" and how to distinguish victim wellbeing from legal aspects, whereby there may be insufficient evidence. Understanding how the brain blocks out trauma should also be included in this mandated training, to allow for a more compassionate and suitable approach allowing the survivor to remember and process their trauma in a safe environment. It is not enough for police to just know what legal steps to take. Police have the power to either halt or propel healing no matter the legal outcome, and hence our police need to be informed about how trauma is blocked out, and about the best practices to avoid retraumatisation.</span>

Violating the code could result in penalties up to $2.75 million dollars or 2 per cent of global turnover—whichever is greater. According to the draft bill, misinformation is defined as unintentionally false, misleading or deceptive content. however, during the pandemic we saw that any information that went against the narrative or made the government look bad was branded "misinformation", even if it was true, while government disinformation (for example, branding people who opposed lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccine mandates "far-right extremists") was allowed to proliferate unchecked. If the legislation is passed, these new powers will be abused. Free speech will be restricted and inconvenient truths will be suppressed. There are also privacy concerns around requiring social media platforms to disclose records regarding misinformation and disinformation, potentially leading to persecution of individual dissidents. </span>

The group was deemed a Specially Designated Global Terrorists by the US (2020) and a terrorist entity by Canada (2021). RIM, which has affiliations across Europe and the US, offers training in urban warfare, psyops and tactical medicine to extremists and neo-Nazis across the globe, including those who committed bombings in Sweden in 2016. RIM members don't recognise Ukraine as a country and have fought with pro-Russians in the Donbas since July 2014, as well as fought as mercenaries in the Middle East and North Africa. The Kremlin funds and aligns with RIM and uses the group to politically destabilise the West by using terrorism as the weapon; with the group believed to be behind a letter bomb campaign in Spain in 2022 on behalf of the Russian Intelligence. </span>

Determining RIM as terrorists aligns with similar reasons for those already deemed by Australia, e.g. Islamic State, Hamas, Hezbollah.

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to alian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to take immediate action in addressing the issues presented with the current online queue system for popular event tickets. We ask that the ACCC enforce new regulations requiring ticketing companies, like Ticketek, to provide clear and accurate estimates of wait times for consumers. By implementing these changes, we can ensure a more transparent and efficient ticket purchasing process, thereby alleviating the unnecessary stress and economic impact experienced by thousands of Australians. Your support is invaluable in driving this significant improvement in consumer experience.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Federal Parliament has the power to veto legislation by Territories of the Commonwealth, we the undersigned, call on the Federal Parliament to override the ACT Government's compulsory acquisition of Calvary Hospital. The ACT Legislative Assembly passed legislation to take-over Calvary Hospital on July 3, 2023. The ACT Government has demonstrated that it is unwilling to dialogue with hospital authorities and ACT citizens. As the ACT Government is already struggling to provide adequate services at Canberra Hospital, there is no reason to believe that it can competently run a second hospital. Moreover, it has failed to demonstrate that it is necessary to compulsorily acquire Calvary Hospital. The Territory continues to need a major, independently run hospital that provides high-standard services, as Calvary Hospital already does. The petition has been circulated to people of many religious faiths as there is serious concern among faith communities that this action will extend to state intervention in other faith-based institutions. Across Australia, the Catholic Church has established hospitals, trained medical professionals and served the community for 170 years. Today, 21 public and 54 private Catholic hospitals treat more than 1.5 million patients annually, or three patients every minute. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">e-Waste is a growing problem facing not just Australia, but the world. The e-Waste problem is growing due to the inability for people to repair their hardware which they have bought with their own money. The rights of people to be able to repair their own purchased hardware should be protected. This will help reduce the e-Waste that is generated day by day. For example, instead of replacing the entire phone, replace a component that is faulty. Could we really imagine a world where the manufacturer of a car refuses to replace a seat and recommend scrapping the whole car and suggest buying a new one?</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians walked out of the global pandemic but soon found we were greeted by the soaring interest rate as the RBA lifted the cash rate target from 0.1 per cent (May 2022) to 4.1 per cent (June 2023), representing a skyrocketing increase of 40 times in just 13 months. Coincidently if not causally, electricity prices also increase by 20% or even higher from 1 July 2023. Australian families are demanded to pay more and harder with the hike of interest rate, home rent and commodity prices. Furthermore, Australia has entered into a nuclear-powered submarine deal with foreign countries, costing Australians up to $368bn. Australia has about 33% of the world's uranium deposits and is the world's third largest producer of uranium. While countries like the US, the UK, Canada and France are using their nuclear power plants to supply electricity to their civilians, Australia does not follow suit; rather, it is banning the operation of any nuclear power plant for civil use. We wish to call for meaningful action to drop interest rates and electricity prices. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The housing crisis in Australia is a multifaceted problem characterized by soaring property prices, rising rental costs, and a scarcity of affordable housing options. Short-term rentals, such as those facilitated by Airbnb, represent only a small part of this larger crisis. However, they contribute significantly to the diminishing availability and affordability of housing, exacerbating the problem for long-term residents. The conversion of residential properties into lucrative short-term rentals reduces the stock of long-term rental properties, making it increasingly difficult for individuals and families to secure stable housing. While regulations or a potential ban on short-term rentals alone may not solve the housing crisis, addressing this aspect is a crucial step toward creating a more equitable and sustainable housing market that prioritises the needs of long-term residents.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to draw inspiration from the successful example of state cooperation following the mass shooting in Port Arthur, which led to the creation of the National Firearms Agreement. This cooperative effort resulted in effective gun-control measures, we implore the government to harness the power of the National Cabinet to address the issue of short-term rentals. We request that the government, if federal regulation or a ban is not immediately feasible, add the regulation or banning of short-term rentals to the National Cabinet's agenda. By fostering collaboration and unity among all levels of government, we can work towards comprehensive solutions to alleviate the housing crisis and create a fair and sustainable housing market that prioritises the long-term well-being of Australian citizens.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We are raising awareness about the brutal attacks on Parachinar and its surroundings in Pakistan's Kurram district. Perpetrated by groups such as the Taliban, Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, Laskhar e Jhangvi, and other anti-state outfits, these violent acts target innocent civilians through roadside attacks and village raids. Parachinar has a tragic history of violence, with a devastating five-year siege from 2007 to 2011 forcing over 2,500 families to migrate and displacing countless individuals. The ongoing wave of violence since May 4th, 2023, including the killing of schoolteachers, has led to a dire humanitarian situation with shortages of food, medicine, fuel, and basic necessities. Educational institutions have closed, leaving the future of the region's youth uncertain, forcing many to migrate in desperation.</span>

With collective efforts, we can improve the lives of those affected and restore peace and stability in the region.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Urge the Pakistani government to adopt comprehensive strategies to protect the vulnerable population from the aforementioned militant groups.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Research students are essential to our country's innovative industries and are the future leaders of our workforce. However, the current national stipend of $32,500 per year is not enough to cover even the most basic living expenses. When considering the average 50 hours of work per week for 50 weeks per year this kind of research often takes, this equates to a meagre hourly rate of $13. Even at the national working hour average of 38 hours per week, the hourly rate is still only $17.10. The national minimum hourly rate is now $23.23. Research students do not receive paid sick leave or personal time off either, and are expected to take unpaid leave instead. This lack of support forces many students to seek part-time employment to supplement their stipend, which negatively impacts their research and increases their stress levels, leading to a higher risk of mental health issues. Many talented individuals are forced to abandon their studies because they cannot afford to support themselves, their families, or cover basic expenses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to provide a minimum living wage to Master and PhD research students by raising the stipend payments to $44,137 per year, equivalent to the minimum wage for 38 hours of work per week for 50 weeks. This will significantly improve the quality of life for thousands of Australian research students. This investment will ensure that our country's innovation is supported and our future leaders are empowered.</span>

Chris Bowens plans were revealed on his recent visit to the Hunter region. The proposal is for at least 130 wind turbines with the possibility of more in the future. The proposal puts them between 10km and 30km off the pristine coastline of Port Stephens. They can be up to 260m in height, by admission of the consultation department, they will be visible from shore. This will not only be damaging to tourism but will also impact fishing, shipping and marine life.</span>

People who applied for this visa have spent three years in the regional area, contributed to the economy, helped with skilled staff shortage and fulfilled their commitment to the government. Yet their lives are now in limbo as without a permanent resident, their choice of jobs are limited because some jobs are only available to Australian residents, their children had to miss out on education as international fees are three to four times higher than domestic student's, some cannot afford a house as they have to pay an extra 7% stamp duty upfront as a foreigner (approximately $40000 more for a median house price of $600000). It is unfathomable why there are 190 and 189 visas being granted every week, yet a visa 191 with much more straightforward requirements and easier-to-verify information (as applicants have been living in Australia) hasn't had a single grant. There has been no update on processing time for 191 visa at all, besides a vague quote that it is assessed on a 'case by case' basis.

Eczema also results in absenteeism from school and work, costing the economy $4 billion a year. Despite this, many Australians struggle to see a specialist due to a nationwide shortage of dermatologists, leading to suboptimal care, including the underuse of topical corticosteroids resulting in avoidable disease flares. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Hon Michelle Rowland MP, Minister for Communications, regarding Petition EN4114, requesting the establishment of a task force to fund and develop the feature film <span style="font-style:italic;">G.I.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The work of the Australian creative sector, including the screen industry, is essential.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This landmark new policy is shaped around the five goals of Creative Australia, established when the Hon Julia Gillard was Prime Minister. <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive </span>is available at www.arts.gov.au/culturalpolicy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive, </span>the Australian Government provides significant support to the Australian screen industry, recognising the important role it plays in shaping Australia's national identity. The Australian Screen Production Incentive is the Government's primary mechanism for providing support to the screen industry. It provides tax incentives for film, television and other screen production in Australia and is available in three streams:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Producer Offset, administered by Screen Australia, entitles a production company to a 40-per-cent rebate on qualifying Australian production expenditure on eligible feature films and 30 per cent on other formats (television, online, DVD) for productions with significant Australian content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Post Digital and Visual Effects (PDV) Offset, administered by the Office for the A1is in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (my department), provides a 30-per-cent rebate on qualifying expenditure for productions undertaking PDV production in Australia. The expenditure threshold for eligibility is $500,000 expenditure on activities reasonably required to perform the PDV production in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Location Offset, administered by the Office for the Arts in my department, provides a 16.5 per cent rebate on qualifying Australian production expenditure for eligible productions with a minimum Australian spend of $15 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government announced the Location Offset will increase to 30 per cent from 1 July 2023. This announcement delivers on the Government's commitment in Revive, Australia's Cultural Policy for the next five years, to encourage investment by large- budget screen productions in Australia. The increase to the Location Offset will secure Australia's competitive position in attracting large budget screen productions to film here and maintain our world-class reputation for filmmaking. It will also benefit the entire screen sector by providing greater employment and development opp011unities for our skilled screen workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive </span>also committed to introducing requirements for Australian screen content on streaming platforms. This will make sure more Australian shows and movies are seen across streaming platforms. These requirements will be implemented as part of the Government's broader reforms to media legislation and are the joint responsibility of the Hon Michelle Rowland MP, Minister for Communications, and myself as the Minister for the Arts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Screen Australia is the Government's primary agency for supporting Australian film, television, documentary and digital media makers, through direct investment in screen development and production. Screen Australia offers funding to support the development, production and marketing of Australian screen content, as well as for the development of Australian talent and screen production businesses. More information is available at www.screenaustralia.gov.au/funding-and-support, or the agency can be contacted by email at info@screenaustralia.gov.au or by phone on 02 8113 5800.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures will build on the significant support the Government already provides for the production of screen content in Australia. In 2021-22, a total of $756 million was invested in the screen sector by the Government through direct funding or incentives. They will allow us to produce even more Australian stories told by Australians, and even more content filmed in Australia using the craft and skills of our dedicated screen professionals.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding petition EN4268 that you presented in the House to formally recognise Taiwan and commit to its protection against Chinese aggression.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and Taiwan share an interest in a rules-based, open, inclusive and stable Indo-Pacific region. Australia values our deep and productive unofficial relationship with Taiwan, underpinned by strong cultural, economic and people to people ties. Australia also works to support Taiwan's participation in international organisations and conferences where appropriate. The Australian Government does not, however, recognise the Republic of China as a sovereign state.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have said publicly that a combination of factors, including Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, and the risk of miscalculation, comprise the most confronting circumstances that Australia has faced in decades.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia opposes any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and recognises that a conflict over Taiwan would be catastrophic for all. Australia will continue to call for cross-Strait issues to be resolved peacefully through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 7 November 2022 concerning Petition EN4272—Request to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interactive Gambling Act 2001 </span>to include games containing loot boxes, in-game currencies operating secondary markets and microtransactions. I note that due to a technical issue, this petition was received in my office on 25 July 2023. apologise for the delay in replying.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 September 2022, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs (the Committee) launched an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. While the inquiry examined online gambling broadly, under the terms of reference the inquiry also examined the appropriateness of the definition of 'gambling service' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interactive Gambling Act 2001 </span>and whether it should be amended to capture additional gambling-like activities in computer games including loot boxes and social casino games. The Committee received 161 submissions and held 13 public hearings with a variety of research, industry, community and government representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 28 June 2023 the Committee released their report' <span style="font-style:italic;">You win some, you lose more'. </span>The Committee did not recommend amending the definition of 'gambling service' to capture loot boxes and simulated gambling. It recommended additional consumer protection measures for computer games containing these products, including default spending controls, tightening of simulated gambling advertising and more transparency on the odds of obtaining rewards from loot boxes. The Government is currently considering the Committee's recommendations and will respond in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 29 March 2023, I announced the Government's intention to seek agreement of the states and territories to introduce a mandatory minimum classification of R 18+ (Restricted to persons 18 and over) for games which contain simulated gambling and M (Mature—not recommended for persons under 15 years) for computer games containing loot boxes that can be purchased.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In its report, the Committee acknowledged the Government's proposed mandatory minimum classifications as an important first step in the regulation of gambling-like products in computer games. The Government is also exploring a number of consumer protection measures to further assist the Australian community to make informed choices about these products.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for conveying a petition that calls for a ban on Australian companies and individuals from obtaining or supplying goods or services, investing or otherwise, with Russian Federation-based entities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia condemns Russia's illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine. We are working closely with Five Eyes, G7 and other partners to impose significant economic and political costs on Russia and those supporting its invasion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to expand Australia's comprehensive suite of sanctions and trade measures against Russia. We have imposed more than 1,100 targeted financial sanctions, and a range of import and export bans. Australia has banned the import of Russian refined petroleum, coal, gas and gold, and the export to Russia of alumina, bauxite and certain luxury goods. At the G7 Leaders' Summit in May 2023, Prime Minister Albanese also announced a ban on the export of all machinery and related parts to Russia and areas temporarily under Russian control, which will be implemented shortly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has also imposed an additional 35 percent tariff on the import of goods produced in Russia or Belarus. In tandem, we have waived tariffs on Ukrainian-produced goods imported to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures have been carefully calibrated to deny Russia access to our markets and ensure Australia does not inadvertently fund Russia's war machine. As a result, Australia's previously limited trade with Russia has declined to negligible levels. From January 2023 to June 2023, Australia's imports from Russia were down 99.96 per cent and Australian exports to Russia were down 99.99 per cent, compared to the same period two years prior.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sanctions are a foreign policy tool to influence state behaviour short of armed force. Appropriately targeted sanctions, imposed in conjunction with other diplomatic levers, can effect positive change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Russia's economy faces a long, slow grind. Sanctions and Russia's partial mobilisation are disrupting and diverting economic resources, contributing to a contraction of Russia's GDP by 2.1 per cent in 2022. Looking forward, Russia's isolation from Western markets will see its productivity decline further, limiting the economic resources it can commit to its illegal war on Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia unequivocally supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. As a true and reliable partner, we continue to play our part to uphold the UN Charter, international law and the rules-based order. Australia's objective, along with our partners, is to empower Ukraine to end the war on its own terms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is in this context that Australia has committed approximately $890 million in important defence, economic and emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. This has included around $710 million in military assistance. Most recently the Prime Minister committed a further 30 Bushmasters to Ukraine, taking our total contribution to 120. This builds on other tranches of recent military support, including the gifting of 70 highly capable military vehicles, and the supply of vital 105mm and 155mm ammunition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's assistance is a critical support to Ukraine's defence. The Government remains steadfast in its commitment to empowering Ukraine to resolve this war on its own terms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence originally dated 7 November 2022, re-sent 25 July 2023, regarding Petition Ministerial Referral EN4294. I note that the original email of 7 November 2022 was not received owing to a technical error at the Committee.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the concerns of the petitioner regarding the impact that military service can have on family members, including children of veterans and first responders. While 'generational PTSD' is not a term used by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), 'intergenerational trauma' is a recognised form of trauma when the experience and consequences of surviving a traumatic event is passed from one generation to the next.</span>

Open Arms provides mental health counselling, relationship counselling, peer support services and group programs for people with Australian Defence Force (ADF) service (current and former serving members) and their immediate families. This includes the young and adult children of veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Open Arms promotes military-aware services by employing counsellors and peer workers with a history of military service, and/or experience as a family member or carer of a veteran. The services provided by Open Arms have been developed as a result of 40 years' experience in providing mental health services to veterans, their partners and their younger and adult children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Open Arms operates within a context of trauma-informed practice to provide specialised PTSD treatment services and a range of other supports for veterans and their families who have experienced trauma and generational trauma. Open Arms' support for partners and children of veterans includes referral for psychiatric assessment to inform treatment planning to ensure that Open Arms interventions are appropriately tailored to the client.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the support provided through Open Arms, DVA also funds the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation to deliver their 'Defence Kids' program across Australia. The 2022-23 Budget provided $13.7 million over three years from 2022-23 to support this program in recognition that children in Defence and veteran families can often live with additional challenges to their civilian peers. This funding will support a focus on children of ex-serving members who may be more vulnerable following their parent's separation from the ADF and the loss of their Defence community support system.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the referral of petition EN4310 regarding the extradition of Julian Assange.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand there is strong interest in Mr Assange's case and a depth of community sentiment. The Australian Government has been clear in its view that Mr Assange's case has dragged on for long enough and should be brought to a close. The Prime Minister and I have expressed this view to the governments of the United Kingdom and United States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As we do for other Australians facing legal proceedings overseas, the Australian Government is following Mr Assange's case closely and offering consular assistance to him. The Australian Government will continue to convey its expectations that Mr Assange is entitled to due process, humane and fair treatment, access to proper medical care and access to his legal team.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is unable to intervene in another country's legal or court processes, just as they are unable to intervene in Australia's. While we are doing what we can between the Australian Government and other governments concerned, there are limits until Mr Assange has concluded legal processes. In a comparable case the resolution by government was only possible once legal processes had been concluded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to present this petition.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 7 November 2022 but received by my office on 26 July, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning petition EN4314 which calls for social media to be banned for children under 18.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge community concern about children spending time on social media and its impact on their mental and physical health. The Government leads a number of measures to help Australian children stay safe online. The Government supports safe and responsible use of social media, where young people are able to enjoy the benefits of the internet and connect to their peers online. The view of the Australian Government is that banning social media for those under 18 would not be a prop01iionate response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers that parents and carers are best placed to make decisions about their children's use of technology. Accordingly, the Government focusses on empowering parents and carers to make educated and informed decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government invests in assisting parents, carers and children to stay safe online. The Government has delivered on its election commitment to provide $6 million over three years for the national rollout of eSmart digital and media literacy products, developed by the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation. Secondary schools across Australia can access free online media literacy resources to equip high school students with critical skills to interpret what they read and view online. More information about the eSmart products can be found at www.alanahandmadeline.org.au/what-we-do/prevention-programs/esmart.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Online Safety Act 2021 </span>supports Australians online by providing the eSafety Commissioner with powers to crack down on cyberbullying, toxic online abuse, harmful content and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The cyberbullying scheme for Australian children provides the eSafety Commissioner with powers to order the removal of cyberbullying material from a full range of online services where children are spending time. Further information about how the eSafety Commissioner can help is at www.esafety.gov.au/key-issues/cyberbullying.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of online and telephone resources that offer support for people experiencing online harms.

Free online webinars, downloadable books, information sheets and resources with easy to follow advice can be found at www.esafety.gov.au/Qarents. The eSafety Commissioner maintains a range of supportive resources about the impacts of spending time online, with advice on how to recognise online harms and how to create healthy boundaries with technology.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter received on 25 July 2023 enclosing petition EN4326, regarding integrated transport and flood resilience solutions for the western suburbs of Brisbane. I note the concerns and observations raised around the impact of flooding events on transport infrastructure in Brisbane, which resulted in isolation of some communities and restricted access to essential goods and emergency/medical services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that Australia is facing more challenging natural disasters than ever before. Close to 70 per cent of Australians were impacted by storms, floods, cyclones and bushfires in 2022 alone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 September 2022 the Australian Government established the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to create a single, enduring, end-to-end agency to better respond to emergencies, help communities recover, and prepare Australia for future disasters. NEMA provides national leadership and strategic oversight across the disaster management continuum, while collaborating across sectors and all levels of government to strengthen resilience.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Planning for, and responding to disasters is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. The primary way in which the Australian Government supports states and territories with the costs of providing relief and recovery assistance to communities is through the jointly-funded Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the DRFA, jurisdictions determine the type and level of assistance to make available following a disaster. Importantly jurisdictions are not bound by the DRFA, and can make available whatever assistance they deem necessary, regardless of whether it is eligible for cost sharing under the DRFA. Programs funded through the DRFA in Queensland are administered by the Queensland Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, local governments are largely responsible for the day-to-day management of local road networks, including road safety, road funding, road maintenance, and heavy vehicle access.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Road funding for councils is provided by the Australian Government though a number of mechanisms, including the identified Local Roads component of the Financial Assistance Grants, the Roads to Recovery Program, the Black Spots Program and the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the matters raised in this petition fall within the responsibility of the state and local governments in Queensland, interested members of affected communities may wish to raise the concerns highlighted in petition EN4326 with the Queensland Government, Brisbane City Council, or their local State Member of Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing petition EN4326 and the signatories' concerns to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government regularly engages with our Indian counterparts on human rights. India understands our strong position on such matters. When Australia and India have concerns with one another, we raise those concerns respectfully and directly.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia encourages the peaceful settlement of the final status of Jammu and Kashmir, underscored by the protection of human rights to ensure stability and economic recovery.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The words and tune of the Australian National Anthem were proclaimed by the Governor-General of Australia on 19 April 1984, after extensive surveys of national opinion, starting in the 1970s. On 1 January 2021, the second line of the Anthem changed from '<span style="font-style:italic;">For we are young and free</span>' to '<span style="font-style:italic;">For we are one and free</span>.'

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 8 November 2022 to the Hon Tony Burke MP, Minister for the Arts, concerning Petition EN4451, requesting the introduction of a new classification (C) for 'lack of consent' on all media containing depictions of non-consensual sexual acts. Minister Burke has forwarded the correspondence to me as the National Classification Scheme (NCS) falls within my portfolio. I note that due to a technical issue, this petition was received in my office on 25 July 2023. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the NCS the Classification Board (the Board), an independent statutory body, classifies films, computer games and certain publications, applying a classification rating (such as G or PG) and providing consumer advice about the content of the work. In deciding a rating, the Board must apply the National Classification Code, relevant sections of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 </span>(the Act) and the relevant classification guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposal to introduce a new classification category for 'lack of consent' would require amendment of the classification guidelines. Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergovernmental Agreement on Censorship 1995, </span>any change to the classification guidelines must be subject to a public submissions process and be unanimously agreed by state and territory ministers responsible for classification. The Government does not intend to propose a change to the classification categories at this time. Research conducted by my department in 2022 found high levels of community satisfaction with the current categories, and the 2020 Review of Australian classification regulation (the Stevens Review) recommended against changing the categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Board has discretion to formulate consumer advice however it considers appropriate. The Board has an established practice for providing consumer advice about depictions of sexual violence, but would usually provide specific consumer advice on other non-consensual sexual acts only if they were assessed by the Board as being potentially harmful, disturbing or upsetting to viewers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Board has recently considered whether it should provide consumer advice about non- consensual sexual activity that may not be understood as sexual violence. In May 2023, the Board announced a number of enhancements to consumer advice to provide more detailed warnings to consumers about content of concern, however the Board has not elected to introduce additional consumer advice about 'lack of consent'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March 2023, the Government announced a two-stage process of reform to the NCS. In addition to regulatory arrangements, the second stage of reform will consider the appropriate scope and purpose of the NCS, including the role of classification in educating community members about matters such as consent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I hope the information in this letter is of some assistance.</span>

It maps the Government's vision for a targeted, simpler migration system, and will form the basis of the Migration Strategy, due to be released later in 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Outline is informed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Migration System </span>Report, led by Dr Martin Parkinson AC PSM. The Review notes that successive governments have chosen to limit the places available for permanent visas for parents because of their large negative economic and fiscal impact in the context of an ageing Australian population. Older migrants increase demand for services, particularly health and aged care, which are already under pressure due to the rapid decline in Australia's ratio of working age people to older people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Reviewers acknowledged that parent migrants contribute to Australia's economy, such as by providing childcare to their grandchildren, which may also allow their child to re-enter the workforce. However, available evidence suggests this comes at a significant cost to the Australian community as a whole.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is now developing its Migration Strategy, with consultations led by Minister O'Neil, supported by the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP. They have held targeted consultations with state and territory governments, unions, business and industry representatives, to seek their views and inform elements of the Migration Strategy. I have copied this response to Minister O'Neil.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 17 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4854, which calls for the withdrawal of ABC Triple J's sponsorship and funding of Groovin' the Moo music festival. The petitioners also ask that a mechanism is devised to mandate content in Northern Australia as part of any Triple J or ABC event sponsorship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC, which includes its radio station, Triple J. The Parliament has guaranteed the broadcaster's independence so that its editorial decisions can be free from political interference. Event sponsorships, editorial decisions and complaints handling are the responsibility of the ABC board and executive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the ABC and Triple J are proud sponsors of the event, I understand that festival venue locations are ultimately determined by the event organisers, Cattleyard Promotions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerned members of the public are encouraged to contact the ABC to put forward their views. Complaints can be submitted to the ABC using its web form at abc.net.au/contact/complain.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Direct contact is the best way to make sure the ABC is aware of these concerns and is given an opportunity to respond. The ABC is also accountable to the Parliament through appearances before committees, including Senate Estimates, and through the production of annual reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 May 2023 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding petition number EN4889, relating to the extradition matter involving Mr Talalelei Pauga.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition asserts that an arrest warrant issued in Samoa on 25 February 2020 for Mr Pauga has been withdrawn and, accordingly, Mr Pauga is no longer an 'extraditable person' within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Extradition Act I 988 </span>(Cth).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For the Committee's assistance, I welcome the opportunity to provide the following information and clarification in response to the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The extradition proceedings in this matter have been progressed on the basis of consultation with the Office of the Attorney-General of Samoa, which indicates that the arrest warrant remains on foot. In November 2021, Mr Pauga filed an application in the Supreme Court of Samoa to quash the arrest warrant issued for him in Samoa, as well as to quash the criminal proceedings filed against him. That application is opposed by the Attorney-General of Samoa. Mr Pauga's application was heard before the Supreme Court of Samoa in March 2022, and judgment is reserved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The application brought by Mr Pauga in the criminal justice process in Samoa is a matter for the Supreme Court of Samoa, to be determined in accordance with Samoan law. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment further.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Samoa maintains its extradition request for Mr Pauga in order that he may face prosecution for a serious offence. That request is being appropriately progressed through the extradition process. The arrest warrant issue has been raised by Mr Pauga in recent extradition litigation, in particular in bail applications in extradition proceedings remitted to a magistrate and before the Full Federal Court of Australia. The Attorney-General's Department's position has been that it is a matter for Samoan authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 April 2023, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia handed down judgment that restored the finding made by a magistrate of the State of Queensland that Mr Pauga is eligible for surrender to Samoa under the Extradition Act. The matter is at the final stage of the extradition process, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment fu1ther.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the steps sought in the petition are premised upon statements with which I am unable to agree, I do not propose to take these steps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 18 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4891, which requests a Royal Commission into the Murdoch media. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern with the Murdoch media. The petition requests that the House of Representatives call a Royal Commission in to the Murdoch media empire and the control and influence they have over Australian democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports a diverse and sustainable media sector. We recognise that quality news and public interest journalism play an important role in the functioning of Australian society and democracy. Australian media organisations play a crucial role in informing Australians about events and developments that are important to their daily lives and enable them to participate in our democratic processes. Journalism is vital in holding public office holders and those in positions of power to account and exposing wrong doing and injustice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There have been a number of reviews and inquiries into media diversity and public interest journalism in recent years, including the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee inquiry into media diversity in Australia. Rather than another inquiry, the Government is focused on working to address past findings and recommendations by implementing measures that support the long-term viability of the sector. These include a $29 million local news and community broadcasting transition package to support regional, local and community media. This includes the $15 million Regional and Local Newspaper Publishers Program to support regional and local publishers to absorb rising print costs. This much needed funding will support the provision of trusted and quality news to local communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 14 November 2022, I announced the first step towards a news measurement framework for the digital era: that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) would consult on a news measurement framework for diversity and localism in Australia. The ACMA undertook public consultation on a new framework for measuring media diversity in Australia between January and March 2023 and received 24 Submissions. The ACMA is considering the feedback and will provide further information on the finalisation and implementation of the news measurement framework later in 2023. For further information visit: acma.gov.au/consultations/2023-01/new-framework-measuring-media-diversity-australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also committed to developing a News Media Assistance Program (News MAP) to secure the evidence base needed to inform longer term news media policy interventions and to develop measures to support public interest journalism and media diversity. We will continue to monitor the status of media concentration in Australia as we develop this evidence base.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 17 May 2023, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning Petition EN4913—the harassment of women online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government shares the petitioners' concerns and believes that all Australians should be able to use online services safely. Keeping Australians safe online is a shared goal across governments, industry, civil society groups and the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the release of the Australian Law Reform Commission's 2014 <span style="font-style:italic;">Serious Invasions of Privacy in the Digital Era </span>report, there have been significant developments in regulating the online environment and protecting Australians online. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Online Safety Act 2021 </span>(the Act), and its predecessor legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015, </span>are impo1iant steps in keeping Australians safe online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Act, the eSafety Commissioner has responsibility for a cyber abuse scheme for Australian adults. The scheme provides a pathway for those experiencing the most seriously harmful online abuse to have this material removed from the internet. The scheme operates on the basis of complaints made to the eSafety Commissioner where services have failed to remove abusive content, and applies to the full range of online services used by Australians. There are significant financial penalties where services fail to respond to a removal notice from the eSafety Commissioner. More information can be found at www.esafety.gov.au/key-issues/adult-cyber-abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eSafety Commissioner also has information-gathering and investigative powers and, in certain circumstances such as when a user is engaging in serious cyber abuse, can require service providers to produce contact information about the end-users. This information can then be used by the eSafety Commissioner to issue removal notices, formal warnings or remedial directions. These powers complement investigatory powers in the Act, which may be used to require a person to appear before the eSafety Commissioner, to answer questions, or produce documents in relation to harmful online conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act also includes a set of Basic Online Safety Expectations that articulate minimum expectations for online service providers (such as social media services) to improve protections for users. The eSafety Commissioner has the power to require service providers to report on their compliance with these Expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may also be aware that the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Action Plan to End Violence against ·women and Children </span>(2022-2032) acknowledged the detrimental impacts of technology-facilitated abuse. As part of the Government's commitment to the National Action Plan, the Government has funded a $10 million grants program, led by the eSafety Commissioner, to support innovative projects to prevent technology-based abuse against women. The program will be delivered from 2023—2028 and there are three rounds of funding available, with the first round having closed on 29 May 2023.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 17 May 2023 regarding petition EN4966 relating to filming in public places. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Filming in Public Places</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no general restriction in Australian law on filming in public places, although there are some exceptions to this. Some States and Territories have provisions in their criminal laws to prohibit indecent filming without consent, and indecent photography of children in private and public places. You may wish to contact the justice department equivalent in your state or territory for more information on relevant State and Territory laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Aspects of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copyright Act 1968 </span>(Copyright Act) could also be relevant to filming in public in some circumstances. Where filming in public captures (copies) copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner, this could amount to copyright infringement. There are a number of exceptions in the Copyright Act that could apply, however, including those relating to the filming of sculptures or other works of artistic craftsmanship in public places, the filming of buildings, or the incidental filming of artistic works. Broader 'fair dealing' exceptions may also apply if the filming is done for purposes such as reporting the news, research or study, criticism or review, or parody or satire. The Copyright Act also protects performers from the unauthorised recording of their performances and provides creators with 'moral rights' over their materials, including the right to be attributed for their work and not to have their work treated in a derogatory way, which could be infringed by filming in public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The common law also provides causes of action which may be used to protect against physical intrusions upon, and surveillance of, a person. Trespass to the person and trespass to land provide some protection against unauthorised interference with a person's body or intrusions into property. A tort of nuisance for unreasonable interference with an occupier's use and enjoyment of land, such as through the positioning of a surveillance camera, is another cause of action under common law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Certain photography may be restricted in some areas by local councils or authorities and a person who causes annoyance or inconvenience to other persons in a public area may be required to leave the area when requested by a police officer. Restrictions may also be imposed by local councils on premises under their control, such as swimming pools. It is advisable to check with the local council for any restrictions on photography or filming.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act) is the principal piece of Australian legislation protecting the handling of personal information about individuals. However, the Privacy Act does not cover individuals acting in a personal capacity, such as neighbours taking photographs or filming in public places for personal use. The Privacy Act deals with the protection of personal data and the security of personal information held by Commonwealth government agencies and certain private sector organisations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to protecting Australians' personal information and to strengthening privacy laws. Earlier this year the Government published a detailed review of the Privacy Act undertaken by the Attorney-General's Department, which will help ensure it remains fit-for-purpose, supports an innovative economy and responds to new challenges in the digital age.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act Review Report (the Report) contained 116 proposals for reform to Australia's privacy laws. The Report proposed introducing a statutory t01t to provide individuals with the ability to seek redress for serious invasions of privacy. The invasion of privacy would need to be either a serious intrusion into seclusion or a serious misuse of private information. The recommendation would require a plaintiff to prove:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If implemented, the statutory tort would provide a remedy for Australians whose privacy is invaded in situations which fall outside the scope of the Privacy Act. For example, an individual taking a video of a person where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy (such as in a public bathroom).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General's Department recently undertook public consultation on the Report. Submissions and feedback received through this consultation will be used to inform the Government's response, which will set out the pathway for reforms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Constitution recognises the States as an integral element of our federation. Various provisions deal with the election of members of the House of Representatives from the States and the election of senators 'for each State'. The Constitution preserves the powers of State parliaments and deals with the relationship between Commonwealth and State legislation. The High Court has, in addition, held that Commonwealth legislation may not impair the constitutional status of the States or their capacity to function as governments.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 22 May 2023, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning Petition EN5010—seeking a ban on sending unsolicited images online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government shares the petitioners' concerns about the online abuse of women.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eSafety Commissioner administers the Image-Based Abuse Scheme under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Online Safety Act 2021 </span>(the Act), which addresses the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Under the Act, the eSafety Commissioner can require the removal of intimate images within 24 hours of a removal notice being issued. For the purposes of the Act, an 'intimate image' is an image or video that depicts or appears to depict a person, and which shows nudity, sexual poses, private activity such as showering, or someone without the religious or cultural clothing they would normally wear in public. Non-compliance with an eSafety removal notice can result in significant financial penalty. Importantly, the scheme applies to the full range of online services where Australians spend time, including social media services, messaging apps, websites, games and hosting services. The scheme also applies to private messages, including SMS messages, direct messages or messages on chat services. Victims of image- based abuse, or their authorised representative, can report image-based abuse to the eSafety Commissioner at www.esafety.gov.au/report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eSafety Commissioner is able to assist Australian women who are at risk of, or experiencing, abuse online. eSafety's website offers practical advice for women of all ages on how to take control of their technology use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">eSafety also provides physical and online resources, as well as toolkits for people at risk and front line staff who support them, such as staff in crisis centres and women's shelters. Further information on online safety for women can be found at www.esafety.gov.au/women.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Every Australian deserves to live free from violence and abuse, and this includes being free from online abuse. To this end, the Albanese Government—together with state and territory governments—has committed to ending gender-based violence through the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032 </span>(the National Plan).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support implementation of the National Plan, the Government provided an additional $3.5 million in the 2023-24 Budget to the organisation 'Teach Us Consent' to develop consent and respectful relationships-related social media content, which aims to reduce sexual violence among young Australians. This funding also includes support for a new youth-led expert advisory group which will provide advice on how to effectively engage young people on consent and sexual violence prevention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023 24 Budget, the Government also committed to providing sustained national leadership and action to work with states and territories to prevent and address sexual violence, including through strengthening and harmonising sexual assault and consent laws. These commitments recognise that a comprehensive, whole-of-society approach is essential to achieving a meaningful reduction in the rates of sexual violence in Australia.</span>

Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws make discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status unlawful in a wide range of areas of public life. In this context, the Government recognises that individuals may identify and be recognised within the community as a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth or during infancy, or as a gender which is not exclusively male or female.</span>

The eSafety Commissioner can consider hateful or dehumanising commentary and symbolism, including when targeted towards LGBTIQA+ people, where it meets the threshold set out in the Act.

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Adult Cyber Abuse Scheme can help individuals targeted by extreme forms of hate speech, including LGBTIQA+ individuals, the Government is considering what more can be done to address hate speech targeting groups of people online.</span>

This includes holding a referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and T01Tes Strait Islander Voice in the Constitution. The Parliament has passed a Bill that enables the referendum to occur. The Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, has said the referendum will be held between late September and December 2023.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed new section in the Constitution would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as Australia's First Peoples.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Constitution has never recognised the unique status of Aboriginal and T01Tes Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of this country. First Nations people face significant gaps in life expectancy, and in educational attainment. They are proportionally the most incarcerated peoples on the planet.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed constitutional alteration both ensures that the Constitution reflects the historical truth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' long-standing and continuing place in Australia, and provides for an institution to improve their lives.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge community concern about children spending time on their mobile phones. However, many children, especially teenagers, have legitimate reasons to have a mobile phone.

              <span class="HPS-Small">There are few jobs more important than being a teacher; having a qualified, committed teacher in front of every classroom in Australia is fundamental to education and student outcomes.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 44(i) of the Constitution makes a person who 'is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power…incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 1 August 2023 regarding a petition (EN5132) presented in the House of Representatives requesting Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) and Airservices Australia (Airservices) to direct all flights from Brisbane Airport that take off over land, to make a U-Turn at altitude to fly over industrial land and return to the bay.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Managing the impacts of aircraft operations on communities around airp01ts is a challenging issue and I acknowledge the concerns regarding operations at Brisbane Airpo1t. The Australian Government recognises the need to balance the impacts of noise on communities near airports with a strong aviation industry that supports movement of passengers, workers and high-value, time sensitive freight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is committed to mitigating the impact on the community from aircraft noise, the safety of aviation operations remains the overwhelming priority and it is not always possible to avoid residential areas, particularly in peak flight periods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Airservices is currently considering opportunities to improve airspace operations around Brisbane Airport and to mitigate noise impacts on smrnunding communities through the Noise Action Plan for Brisbane. In July 2023, Airservices commenced engagement on Phase 2 of the Noise Action Plan, which will focus primarily on options to increase operations over the water. Airservices is holding a series of consultation sessions during August, which I would encourage the signatories of the petition to attend. Information on the Noise Action Plan, including consultation session dates, is available at engage.airservicesaustralia.com/nap4b.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 9 March 2023, the Government also announced the Brisbane Airp011 Community Airspace Advismy Board (AAB) as a new community consultation body around aircraft noise in Brisbane.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Five community representatives from across Brisbane have joined the AAB to oversee the implementation of the Noise Action Plan for Brisbane and ensure the community is adequately consulted on potential airspace changes. Minutes from previous meetings, including the outcomes of action items and further information on the AAB, are available at www.infrastructure.gov.au/aab.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also deliver a new Aviation White Paper in the first half of 2024, which will include consideration of better mechanisms regarding consultation and management of aircraft noise. Details on the Aviation White Paper can be found at www.infrastructure.gov.au/infrastructure-transport-vehicles/aviation/aviation-white-paper.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding Petition EN5149 asking the House of Representatives to create a Royal Commission into COVID-19 vaccine-related deaths. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that the petitioners are very concerned about COVID-19 vaccine-related deaths. However, there is no credible evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have contributed to excess deaths in Australia. While I will outline several sources to support this position below, I would first like to provide some general information about COVID-19 vaccine safety and monitoring conducted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is part of the Department of Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination against COVID-19 is the most effective way to reduce severe illness, hospitalisation, and death from infection. Evidence from more than 13 billion vaccine doses given worldwide shows that COVID-19 vaccines have a very good safety profile in all age groups. The protective benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has a well-established and robust system in place to capture reports of suspected adverse events for all vaccines. Many of these processes have been enhanced dramatically for COVID-19 vaccines, making this the most intense safety monitoring of therapeutic goods ever conducted in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA reviews all deaths reported in people post-administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. Their analysis of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest that the vaccines played a causal role in most of these cases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA also reports on deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines transparently and accurately. Since March 2021, they have regularly and publicly reported on COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring at www.tga.gov.au/news/covid-19-vaccine-safety-reports. This report includes details on the number of deaths reported to the TGA, as well as the outcomes of the assessment of those reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to excess deaths in Australia, recent analysis from the Actuaries Institute found excess mortality remained high in 2022, even after the exclusion of deaths from and with COVID-19 infection.<span style="font-style:italic;">[1]</span> The number of vaccine doses administered in 2022 was approximately half that given in 2021, which clearly indicates that there is not a strong temporal or causal relationship between vaccination and excess mortality. The analysis also reported that most excess deaths occurred in older people (over 65 years of age). The analysis identified that the most likely contributing factors to excess mortality in 2022 were the impact of COVID-19 on subsequent risk of death, particularly from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and dementia, which have all been identified in studies; delays in emergency care during peak COVID-19 and influenza infections; and delays in routine care of non-COVID-19 diseases, such as disruption of medications for people with heart disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, an as-yet unpublished analysis from Australia's National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance reported on a large, nation-wide study that included 3.8 million Australians aged 65 years or over. This study found that a recent COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a reduction in deaths from COVID-19 infection, but also deaths from any cause.<span style="font-style:italic;">[2]</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, review of the patterns in cause of death also does not suggest a relationship with patterns of population vaccination. In the analysis conducted by the Actuaries Institute, the cause of death with the highest proportion of excess deaths was ischaemic heart disease,<span style="font-style:italic;">[1]</span> which is predominantly a longer-term health condition that evolves over time. Ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in Australia, with the proportion of deaths attributed to chronic ischaemic heart disease increasing since 2019.<span style="font-style:italic;">[3]</span> Between 2018 and 2021, there was no change in the 5 most common causes of death in Australia, and diabetes has also remained in the top 10 causes of death.<span style="font-style:italic;">[4]</span> The only change in 2022 was COVID-19 becoming the third most common cause of death. This unchanged pattern in causes of death also does not support a link between vaccination and excess deaths.</span>

Once a petition is presented to the House, the standing orders allow for the Petitions Committee to refer the petition to the minister responsible for the matters raised. The minister is then expected to provide a written response within 90 days. Currently, all petitions are referred to the relevant minister for a response. However, given the significant increase in the number of petitions received by the House since the introduction of electronic petitioning in 2016, the committee is reviewing its approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August, the committee posted an electronic survey on the parliament's website seeking feedback from the public on the issue. As I reported last week, there was an excellent response to the survey, with more than 15,000 people taking the time to share their views. Most survey respondents agreed that a petition should have a minimum number of signatures before it's referred to a minister for response. The majority—76 per cent—supported a threshold of at least 50 or more signatures for the referral of a petition to a minister. This is made up of 15 per cent supporting 50 or more signatures, 26 per cent supporting 100 or more signatures and 36 per cent support 500 or more signatures. The committee is considering these results.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we know that too many Australians are struggling to find a home to rent or to buy right now, facing rent increases and high interest rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional, rural and remote Australians are not immune from this crisis. But we are often ignored in the debate about measures to improve supply. There are multiple policy solutions on offer from the government but not one of them specifically targets the context of rural, regional or remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment (Unlocking Regional Housing) Bill 2023, would kickstart housing supply in regional Australia. It offers solutions on how to equitably and practically fund more houses in regional, rural and remote areas by addressing a major handbrake that rural communities face when creating new places to live. That handbrake is the infrastructure that supports creating new dwellings before you even get to the front door—sewerage, water, power, pavements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the housing supply crisis looks like in regional Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National campaign Everybody's Home found that essential workers in north-east Victoria spend, on average, 44 per cent of their income on rent. The threshold for rental stress is when you spend 30 per cent of your income on rent. In many, many regional towns, rental vacancies are often below one per cent. It's why we are seeing for the first time dozens of people living in tents in forests and by the rivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm constantly hearing from businesses in towns about how hard it is to find accommodation for their workers. The workers in our hospitality venues, factories and health services often can't afford the rental prices. Major employers are scaling back operations because of staff shortages associated with the lack of housing. Even locum doctors to the smaller towns without GPs simply can't find a house to rent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear we must urgently do more to unlock housing supply in regional Australia, and in doing that we need to understand one of the reasons holding back that supply is that, as the people have come, the services that support that growth simply have not kept up. This bill seeks to address that part of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Act. The NHFIC, set up under the act, administers the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, the NHIF. The NHIF is a $1 billion fund set up in 2018 to fund housing-enabling infrastructure, like sewerage, water, electricity, and roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the NHIF has fallen significantly short of achieving its aims. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2021 statutory review found the NHIF has been 'difficult to access and was poorly understood'. Not one local council has successfully applied for NHIF funding to deliver housing-enabling infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, the NHIF has not delivered equitable funding for regional Australia, with annual reports showing an overwhelming majority of projects in the metropolitan areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have raised these issues with NHFIC itself. And I'm grateful to the CEO, Nathan Dal Bon, for accepting my invitation to visit Indi and hear directly from our local governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also taken these issues directly to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing. They've started to listen to me by announcing a $500 million Housing Support Program, to connect essential services and amenities for new housing developments. But $500 million is not nearly enough, and none of it is guaranteed for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses this gap, so that NHFIC can specifically and equitably distribute its funds to regional, rural and remote Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the bill adds an object of NHFIC to provide funding for housing-enabling infrastructure in regional, rural and remote areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill requires the minister to scrutinise what action needs to be taken so that the NHFIC distributes at least 30 per cent of its funds each year to projects in regional, rural or remote areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With almost 30 per cent of the population living outside a major city, regional Australians deserve their fair share of housing funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the bill clarifies that local governments and utility providers can receive NHFIC funding, and requires NHFIC to be more proactive in identifying where this funding should go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, the bill requires regional housing expertise on the NHFIC board. If decision-makers have specific knowledge about the unique housing needs in regional Australia, there are better outcomes for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, the bill requires NHFIC to include in their annual reports how NHFIC's funding was distributed amongst the states and territories, local councils, and regional, rural and remote areas. Right now, we don't know exactly how NHFIC funding is being spent. NHFIC must be transparent about where NHFIC funding is going, so we know if it's going to the right places. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to local councils, community housing providers, not-for-profits, and organisations like the Regional Australia Institute, the Real Estate Institute of Australia and the National Farmers Federation about this bill, and I thank them for their valuable input and their support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in February I supported the government's Housing Australia Future Fund bills, the government's signature policy to address the housing crisis. I attempted to amend these bills in a similar way that this bill amends the NHFIC Act today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the HAFF bills are at a political stalemate with no guarantee on their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the government has made multiple funding announcements for housing supply in recent months, but not one of these is dedicated to regional, rural and remote Australia. There is a blind spot that I am seeking to fix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need action now, and that's why I'm introducing this bill. The housing crisis in regional, rural and remote areas cannot wait any longer, and I urge the government to get behind me and back this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House, and I cede the rest of my time to the member for Calare.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I second the motion. I rise in support of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment (Unlocking Regional Housing) Bill 2023, which amends the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Act 2018. I commend the member for Indi for bringing this very important bill to this House. The reality is that, despite the farm-fresh air, homegrown produce and relaxed way of life, the further away you live from the city, the more likely you are to miss out on the essentials, and that includes housing. That's the cold, hard truth. That's why I am strongly backing in the member for Indi's bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Central West of New South Wales is a wonderful place to live, so much so that we are seeing year on year growth to our population and the great tree change still in full force. But with a rising population there comes rising pressure on housing, health care and essentials. Something must be done to ease this pain and ease this pressure. Constituents of the Calare electorate are frequently contacting me to indicate just how difficult it is to find a place to live in our area, or with innovative proposals to address the housing crisis. For example, the population of Bathurst is expected to grow by 30 per cent to 2041. Our time to act is now. Our constituents want these innovative solutions, and they need help on the double.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent report completed by Shelter NSW, it was determined that 31 per cent of low-income households in the Cabonne area in my electorate are experiencing mortgage stress, while 42 per cent are experiencing rental stress. In Orange, 61 per cent of low-income households are experiencing rental stress and 39 per cent are experiencing mortgage stress. With the rising cost of living, these statistics are only going to get worse. The people of regional Australia need help, and your postcode or socioeconomic status should not determine whether you have access to safe, secure and affordable housing. Time and again, those in our region feel like being west of the Great Dividing Range means they will be forgotten—just look at the recent response to natural disasters in our area and you'll understand why. The member for Indi's proposal to ensure that the National Housing Infrastructure Facility distributes at least 30 per cent of its funds to regional, rural and remote Australia, which is in line with the population of our regions, is a very important step forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to recognise that additional funding and support for homeowners and affordable housing is one important step in providing a roof over people's heads, but the other important element is ensuring that local governments are adequately resourced. Councils like Cabonne Council in my electorate have unfortunately worn the impact of a natural disaster spanning many towns, and their bank accounts are looking much more worse for wear. As with many country councils with a small ratepayer base and significant increases in anticipated population, both councils and residents alike need assistance and funds to provide enabling infrastructure like sewerage, water, electricity, transportation and roads. A solution for this problem is proposed in the member for Indi's bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to support the member for Indi's bill. The people of regional Australia need their voices heard and their needs met, just like their city counterparts do. It's proposals like this one here today before us that bring us one step closer to bridging that great divide between cities and regional Australia. I commend to bill the House. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 1.5 million mortgage holders at risk of mortgage stress. There are 62 per cent of renters in rental stress. But, in the same year in which we've been in one of the worst housing crises we have seen in generations, the Commonwealth Bank has recorded a record $10 billion in profit. There are people going to the supermarket right now making tough choices between feeding their kids and paying the rent; they're finding their grocery bills going up every week. But, at the same time that that is happening, Coles and Woolworths have just recorded record profits. In fact, Coles has just recorded a $1.1 billion profit and Woolworths a $1.62 billion profit. Their profits are going up at the same time as people's household costs, financial stress and cost of living are going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a political and economic system so entirely stacked against ordinary people that we can have Coles and Woolworths come out and talk about how they're going to crack down on more theft occurring at supermarkets while, at the same time, they are robbing millions of Australians blind, abusing their market power and driving up costs, while we have a government—a Labor government—unwilling to hold them to account. I mean, the gall of these massive corporations—making massive profits, then turning it around and saying: 'We don't understand why theft is going up'! Well, what happens when a single mum is at the supermarket and knows that if she can steal a carton of milk then she'll be able to make sure that her kids get a good feed the next day? And all of a sudden, society and the media are focusing on that and not focusing on the fact that these corporations are robbing Australians blind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there is entirely a solution that the government could pursue. Indeed, we've had it costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. The government could introduce a super-profits tax on these corporations. They could make clear to the Commonwealth Bank, to Coles, to Woolworths and to the gas corporations, who are robbing us blind: 'Enough is enough. Every time you earn a super profit, every time you price-gouge Australians, then that will be taxed and we will raise tens of billions of dollars that we can put back towards giving relief to renters and giving relief to mortgage holders. We can use that money to incentivise a freeze and cap on rent increases. We can use it to bring dental into Medicare. We can use it to raise the pension and other government payments above the poverty line, to ensure everyone in this country lives a good life.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the cruellest irony is that, every time inflation has gone up over the last 24 months, the Reserve Bank has solemnly said to Australians: 'The way to deal with the inflation crisis is to raise interest rates.' All that has done is to put pain on mortgage holders, on renters and on ordinary people doing it tough, and it has done nothing to address the real cause of the inflation crisis, which is massive corporate super-profits. Does anyone seriously believe that it's workers and wages that are causing the inflation crisis? A lot of economists now have made it very clear that what is causing the inflation crisis, what is causing the cost of living crisis, is companies like Coles and Woolworths abusing their duopoly power and driving up the cost of living, driving up prices and driving up profits. Then the only solution that our government has had, really, has been to rely on the Reserve Bank to jack up interest rates, which has only put people in more financial stress and more pain and punished the people who have nothing to do with this, while allowing banks like the Commonwealth Bank to drive up their profits even more. That's how rigged this system is against ordinary people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we do have solutions: a freeze and cap on rent increases; taxing super-profits, to make sure those corporations are disincentivised from driving up their prices because they'll know that if they do then we'll just tax that and use that money to do things like bringing dental into Medicare; building public and affordable housing; and fully funding our public education system, so the public schools aren't forced to charge exorbitant student fees—things that have been done before in countries around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, but also we could, for instance, scrap student debt. That's the other deep irony—the cruel feedback mechanism that is screwing people over: every time Coles, Woolworths and the Commonwealth Bank drive up their prices, thus driving up inflation and the rate of CPI, when student debt is indexed, that debt goes up even further. Indeed, we've got a situation where, while gas corporations are making record profits, the government's so-called gas tax is going to raise only $2.5 billion over the next four years, at the same time as the government is about to make $5 billion from indexing student debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a political and economic system entirely stacked against ordinary people and a government unwilling to take on Coles, Woolworths, the Commonwealth Bank and the other multinational corporations currently screwing Australians over. And I think a lot of people are fed up with it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  What a pleasure to get an economics lesson from the Greens! We had an explanation that apparently the superprofits of Australian corporations are 'robbing Australians, causing inflation and preventing us from investing in pensions, dental and many other virtues'. And off he goes because he does not want to hear the error of all of his statistics. He referred to the superprofits tax that he would put onto Coles. This is going to fund the pensions and this is going to fund dental in Australia. When you have a superprofits tax, that superprofits tax sits above profits made at five per cent plus the long-term bond rates. The long-term bond rate is around four per cent, so that would be a nine per cent profit margin. What right now in the latest accounts is Coles profit margin? How far above nine per cent is it? What would be the enormous amount of revenue that the genius member from the Greens would reap through his superprofits tax on Coles? Well, Coles EBIT margins are 5.3 per cent, so less than the threshold—in fact, nearly half the threshold that would qualify for a superprofits tax. The tax that he proposes to put on Coles would not raise a cent, although Coles is apparently robbing Australians through a 5.3 per cent margin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Woolworths, the second company that he identified in his speech about superprofits? Again, he has absolutely no idea what the level of profits are in either of these companies. Woolworths most recent profit margin was six per cent, also below any rate that would qualify for any superprofits tax at any level that has ever been contemplated. Coles and Woolworths are the two companies he identified in his speech, both apparently robbing Australians, one receiving a 5.3 per cent profit margin and the other achieving a six per cent margin, but neither would raise a cent under the superprofits tax that he is proposing. And to suggest that these companies are causing inflation, that an increase in Coles and Woolworths profit margins of less than 100 basis points is causing Australian inflation, is absolutely ridiculous. The maths do not add up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing here is the rollout of the Greens agenda, and this is an agenda to reposition the Greens party as a party that is focused on economics as well as environmentalism. Unfortunately, they are bringing their brand of grandstanding on environmentalism—a brand of policy without real solutions and policies that don't add up—into the economic sphere. I had the misfortune to watch the Greens in action on the most important set of environmental policies that this nation has put forward over the last two decades. In 2009 the Greens opposed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They caused that scheme to go down and began the climate wars that we have lived with ever since. That was an example of the Greens modus operandi, and that modus operandi is not to solve problems because solving problems does not help their political interests. Their modus operandi is to exacerbate those problems in order to fuel the politics of grievance. That is why they opposed the CPRS and that's why they made the perfect the enemy of the good. Unfortunately, now in economics we are seeing a facsimile of that policy approach. We are seeing the Greens take that same politics of grievance and apply it to economics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing that right now with the Housing Australia Future Fund, where the Greens are opposing a good policy that will make a real difference on the ground because they don't want to solve the problem; they want to fuel the politics of grievance. We are seeing that right throughout their policy suite in this area. They are proposing policies that they know will never be implemented. They are opposing policies that are ready to be implemented because they have no interest in actually solving the economic challenges of our nation. They only want to stir grievance and seek to promote their political interests. We have seen this in every single one of the policy areas that they have rolled out in economics, whether it be housing, inflation, budget or fiscal policy. Each time they propose a policy, it becomes more and more ridiculous so that they can create more and more distance between themselves and the government, suggesting policies that they know will never be implemented. The most recent one, their plan for a freeze on rents, was rejected by the Governor of the RBA but is still Greens policy because they're not trying to propose real solutions; they're just trying to promote grievance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Inflation and the cost of living are hitting hard. Rents are up, mortgage payments are up and the cost of food seems to be spiralling out of control. Every day we are greeted with a new statistic that tells us what we already know; this economy is not working for people but instead for giant corporations. You do not have to look much further than the superprofits that companies in Australia are making: Coles, $1.1 billion; Woolies, $1.6 billion; Qantas, 1.7 billion; BHP, $13.4 billion; and Woodside, $1.7 billion so far in this year alone. At the same time, real wages are stagnant and have even been going backwards. Inflation is still sky high. Our wages are buying less today than they did before 2020, and mortgage repayments and rents are spiralling out of control, impacting everyone and having an acute effect on young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk to our friends, our families and our co-workers, and almost everyone shares the same story. It's getting harder and harder to get by. The cost of living, which in itself is just a dystopian phrase, is increasing faster than our wages can keep up with. This story is now backed up by the statistic that Australia has slipped into a per capita recession. It is hard to deny the simple truth about our economic system. Something is very wrong. So, if wages are not the primary driver of inflation, then what is?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Institute, the OECD and the IMF have all come to the same conclusion in the last few months. Corporate profits and price gouging are the primary causes of inflation. The analysis from the OECD covered eight countries, including Australia, and the eurozone. It showed that the contribution of unit labour costs, or wages, to overall inflation was much smaller than in the 1970s and that higher unit profits have been the leading component of recent inflation in several of those countries, including our own. The IMF report also found that rising corporate profit margins accounted for 45 per cent of inflation in Europe since the start of 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if corporate profiteering is driving inflation and causing this cost-of-living crisis, then what is the solution? Increasing interest rates, the Reserve Bank's answer, simply punishes households for a problem that they did not cause. A superprofits tax is the answer. It addresses the primary driver of inflation while providing the government with tax revenue to fund essential public services, easing the cost of living and giving people room to breathe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have proposed a 40 per cent tax on the superprofits of companies with over $100 million in turnover, including multinationals. The tax would apply to net revenue after deducting income tax and making an allowance for a fair return to shareholders. This would raise $53 billion over three years that could be invested into improving quality of life for all Australians. This tax alone would pay for universal child care and bring dental and mental health completely into Medicare, with change left over. That is how you address a cost-of-living crisis driven by corporate greed. And superprofits taxes already exist. Australia would not even be walking an untrodden path. Norway's superprofits tax on oil and gas corporations generated $139 billion for them last financial year. The UK, Spain, France, Germany, Finland and many other countries have all either implemented or proposed superprofits and windfall taxes in recent times. But what do we get in Australia? Nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told by this government that the superprofits of fossil fuel companies are untouchable, that the superprofits of banks—made off the backs of people struggling to pay for shelter—are the banks' birthright. We are told that when giant corporations are doing well we must leave them alone. Their profit margins are never to be questioned. But when giant corporations fall on hard times we must bail them out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our current economic system has proven itself to be stagnating and structurally incapable of living up to the expectations of neoliberal capitalism. Soaring corporate profits have not translated into a better quality of life for everyone else. This rising tide has not lifted all boats, and many have just sunk. People are calling out for an overhaul. A superprofits tax to pay for universal public services that are free at the point of use is the first step in that overhaul.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  On the weekend I watched <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Wizard of Oz</span> with my daughter. It's an absolutely classic film. I must say I feel as though I've returned to the Land of Oz during this motion, with the Greens' approach to economics. We need to impose an ill-thought-out thought-bubble $50-billion-plus tax so that everyone can lead a better life—free beer, free marshmallows for all, unlimited pensions, based on this thought bubble, with some footnote with a 'return to capital' in it that is completely unjustified!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the Parliamentary Budget Office costing of the Greens policy. One of the first things noted in the costing is that the proposal put forward by the Greens has a very high degree of uncertainty. I think that's their euphemism for saying it's ill thought through. Specifically, they say the Greens proposal would be highly sensitive to both international and domestic conditions, that the revenue and costs associated with this massive new tax they're proposing would be highly volatile over time, and that the value of shareholder equity would also be highly volatile over time, which would affect the amount payable under this proposal. The Greens are saying: let's shift to a new massive tax—which is based, as I said, on a pamphlet they put out last year—with almost no justification for the key parameters and without justifying the fact that our pensions, our health system and our NDIS would now be based on a highly volatile new source of taxation, without thinking through the behavioural responses and all of the uncertainty. What are the super profits that they speak of, which we could tap into so easily? This, again, is where the Parliamentary Budget Office refers to the fact that there are inherent uncertainties in their methodology. Again, I think that's a polite way of saying they haven't thought through how this would apply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the footnote in their pamphlet which relates to how this would actually apply in practice. It talks about the fact that their super profits are going to kick in at the risk-free rate plus five per cent. As the previous speaker on this side talked about, what implications would that have in a raft of major sectors in our economy, such as retail? This tax would raise almost nothing. But where does the five per cent come from? It's not clear at all. If one goes to the literature, one finds the long-term equity premium in major economies is between five and eight per cent. It's not an easy number to pin down. What's the current equity premium in Australia? It's around six per cent. What's the equity premium that was identified over recent decades by the RBA? It's six per cent. The core parameter is just asserted in footnote 2 of some pamphlet, with zero justification or analysis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the equity premium changes over time. This five per cent equity premium is not a static figure. It's not at all clear how that would affect the revenue coming into some of our fundamental services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it's absolutely unclear how this would apply across sectors. It is true that, with some resource sectors, there have been attempts, in Australia and in other countries, to tax revenue above a certain normal amount of profit to try to pin down revenue coming from the rents associated with those resources, which is particularly appropriate given that those resources are owned by the community. When one looks at the equity premium across the economy as a whole, however, it's far from clear that a standard figure across the economy is at all appropriate. The risk associated with investments and the risk associated with the returns to equity aren't the same across the economy as a whole. Are the Greens literally saying that they're going to apply the same super profits tax to retail, to financials and to high-risk, cutting-edge advanced manufacturing? This tax would have all sorts of unintended consequences—capital flight, behavioural responses—and, as I just mentioned, it would apply unevenly across sectors in ways that would potentially damage the investment that we need in new sectors. This is a thought bubble, and it won't provide the massive promises that the Greens are claiming.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today very proud to be a member of a government that has successfully inserted energy, funds and people back into our TAFE sector. When we took government, one of the first things we did was have a Jobs and Skills Summit. This summit included people from across the spectrum—from business, from education, from all sectors, from around Australia—to come together with government, with those opposite invited. What did they identify? They identified a massive skills deficit, where the list of skills shortage areas had gone from 153 to 286. In fact, the OECD said that we had the second most severe labour shortage in the developed world. Match that with projections that nine out of 10 new jobs in the next five years will require a postschool qualification. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did this government do? This government got busy. This government talked to territories and states and together came up with a National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development for 2023. We signed to deliver $1 billion in 12 months, working with the states to create 180,000 places in 2023, with the emphasis on our job shortage areas—the care economy, agriculture, hospitality and tourism, construction and technology. The result has been incredible. In fact, we've exceeded that 180,000-place target, with 215,000 Australians enrolled into TAFE in 2023, into courses that are going to fill those job shortages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what a government that works for Australia gets on and does. So we've exceeded that target this year, and the break-up of numbers of people who have gone into the program is as interesting as the big number in itself. In the first six months, with the target of the enrolments exceeded, when you have a look at the people studying, women make up 60 per cent, with nearly 130,000 women taking on a qualification under the program. More than a third of the enrolments, over 34 per cent, are in inner and outer regional locations, exactly the cohorts that we needed, exactly the potential and the talent this country needed to tap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not stopping there. We're making funding available for a further 300,000 Fee-Free TAFE places starting in January next year. The Fee-Free TAFE and VET agreement was only possible because of genuine partnership on skills and training with state and territory governments, established after the Jobs and Skills Summit. Working together with the state and territory governments to rebuild TAFE across this country, to redress our skills shortages with our domestic students, to ensure that Australians aren't being left behind and that business has its skill requirements met without having to press the emergency button is absolutely critical. It ensures that our young people and people wanting to retrain have access to the training that we need as a country. As well as this being interest based, the government has targeted those areas where the shortages are, to ensure that we're attracting people into the skill space as we need them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been clear to me in the nine years that I have been here that the previous government absolutely neglected this space. They were happy to claim there was a skills shortage and create some visas. We need both things happening in this country, and this government is determined to ensure that our domestic students have just as much training as they need to ensure that they can get access to good full-time jobs. If it were left to those opposite, this wouldn't be happening. If we hadn't won government, this wouldn't be happening. Do you know how I know that? Because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has called Fee-Free TAFE 'wasteful' spending. Despite the massive enrolments, despite the commitment shown by Australians to get themselves into these courses, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says it is wasteful spending. That's proof enough for me.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  You are not going to believe what I'm about to say. You are not going to credit me with this statement, but I happen to disagree with the member for Lalor. Isn't that incredible? In fact, the member for Lalor spoke about a labour shortage that was created by a really strong economy. The OECD didn't mention that the strength of the Australian economy was putting enormous pressure our training systems and labour force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments I saw a decade of determined, directed development in the training and TAFE sector. It's amazing how, in a few months only, governments can have a different opinion of the regime that went before them. How could it be that such a spin could be put on the Morrison government particularly? In my 25 years in this place I've not been into personal attacks, whereas the Labor Party spent all of their time denigrating the leader, so the things that were good about government just get passed by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and National parties—I always align myself closely with the National Party—have always supported the opportunity to upskill and re-skill. And we will always support Australia's skills system, which I note is much more than just TAFE. The old school of hard knocks comes into this too with some people leaving school at a young age and doing very well for themselves, thank you very much, especially in country Victoria where we don't have the opportunities for tertiary education as much as we would like—although we have put in a university extended campus in Wonthaggi, which is fantastic news. We have good TAFE colleges right across Gippsland. There always have been good TAFE colleges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to address the misinformation that's being put out by the Labor Party and will continue in the addresses today. The Labor Party has, time and time again, falsely claimed that we underfunded TAFE when we were in government, and that is simply not the case. Vocational education and training is a shared responsibility between Commonwealth and the state and territory governments. State governments are responsible for running their own training systems and have direction over how much government funding is provided to TAFE and other training providers. For example, in the 2022-23 financial year, the Commonwealth provided the states and territories with $1.61 billion through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development. In other words, there were already agreements there before this government came to office. The work that they're enjoying now was put in place by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments working on behalf of the Australian people, putting the national interest first every time, having a great desire for our young people to be well trained so that they may not only improve the Australian economy and Australian society, but they also improve economies around the world. Our apprentices in Latrobe Valley, out of the old SEC, are now engineers around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I put to those who are going to be attacking the past governments of this day: no, there was an enormous amount of work done by Scott Morrison, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull. You should be standing up and patting them on the back because, if they weren't there, people wouldn't have the jobs and opportunities they have today. Thank you. I wish I had 40 minutes to speak on this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Tradies are cool, and it's great to see this Labor government making sure there are more and more of us graduating from the TAFE system. The opportunities that come with a trade really are endless. Just look at my story. I didn't take the usual path before coming into this place. I left school at the age of 15 and got myself an apprenticeship. I eventually became qualified in a trade as a fitter and turner. Looking back, I would not have changed a single thing in my path of life. I love the skills that I learned in my trade, the work that I used to do, the experiences I had and the mates that I made. I'm a proud tradie. My decision to get a trade gave me practical real-world skills that I still use to this day and helped to make me the person that I am today. It really did set me up for life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud to be a member of a government that understands the value of a trade and is focused on making sure that as many young people as possible have the chance to get a trade themselves. Young people should be able to choose the pathway they want to take in life, and this government is helping them to make this happen by providing fee-free TAFE. When we got to government, our TAFE system was a shambles. The numbers of those graduating in a trade were on a steady decline, and this started to show with a huge shortage of tradies all over Australia. But I suppose that is what happens when you leave a system in the hands of those that have never worked a hard day in a trade in their lives for 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have only been in government for one year, but the recovery of TAFE in this country is well underway. Already, our fee-free TAFE policy has proven to be a massive success. In the first six months alone, we have seen more than 214,300 people enrol in a program at TAFE. Our 2023 target was to have 180,000 enrolments, but in just six months we've already smashed our target by more than 35,000 places. That's more than the number of people that sold out a Newcastle Knights game last night. That is nearly 215,000 people with access to life-changing opportunities. It is 215,000 people with a chance to set themselves up for a life with a solid qualification that can lead to a secure job that they can build a good life around. This is the power of a trade, or any other qualification gained through TAFE, and this is the power that this government is making more accessible through our fee-free TAFE policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy also helped those sectors that were crying out for more workers who are qualified. One of those sectors is the care sector. Those in this sector helped to hold this country together during the pandemic. But they need more hands on the job. This is also a sector that is only going to continue to grow as the population continues to age. Our fee-free TAFE policy really did deliver for this sector, with 23.8 per cent of total enrolments being for courses like health care, aged care and disability care. Our construction sector is also going to keep growing as more and more people live in our country and more and more houses need to be built. This sector attracted 9.8 per cent of enrolments. Technology is the future of our world, so it's great to see that courses focused on digital technology received 7.8 per cent of enrolments. Another sector in desperate need of more workers is the childcare sector, which will have the benefit of attracting 5.5 per cent of total enrolments. TAFE is really for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The offer has been taken up by all kinds of people from all over Australia. It has benefited young people, jobseekers, people with disabilities, First Nations Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. It is great to see that women make up 60.2 per cent of the enrolments, with nearly 130,000 women taking on a qualification under this program. Already this policy has offered so much to so many, but it does not stop there. A further 300,000 fee-free TAFE places over three years from 2024 will happen. We are making sure that the sectors that our country relies on have the qualified workers that they need. We are making sure that Australians can get the qualifications that they need to set themselves up for life. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  At the outset let me congratulate the member for Hunter not only on a good speech where he did not play partisan politics but also on the fact that he is a fitter and turner who qualified at TAFE. Brad, the husband of the minister opposite, the member for Eden-Monaro, received his plumbing certificate from TAFE, and the member from La Trobe, who is here at the table, did his policing qualification through TAFE. I have been through TAFE. It is a great institution, and may it long continue to produce some of Australia's finest. Indeed, members for Riverina past and present have long championed the fact that a certificate from TAFE is worth every bit as much as a diploma from a university. And we should celebrate that—indeed, I have said it many, many times. The former member for Riverina, from 1998 through to 2010, my predecessor, Kay Hull AO, said it at the Nationals conference—she is now the federal president—on Saturday, in her opening remarks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said: 'Here we are. Currently, Australia is in the midst of many crises: cost of living, housing shortage, unaffordable electricity, water being extracted from our agriculturalists and more. But the issue that's getting little traction is the massive skills and general labour shortage that is impacting every productive business, every agricultural sector and every housing and construction industry in this nation.' She continued: 'For too long we have had a two-tiered education system in Australia: one tier, the higher education pathway, is applauded and valued and the other, the trades and services apprenticeship pathway, is downplayed or stigmatised in the minds of many, including our parents of young people.' And, of course, she is right. She continued: 'This is not the fault of teachers. They do a magnificent job in delivering the curriculum they are trained for at university; however, that curriculum is designed for about 30 per cent of students who will and should go on to a university. They are charged with this responsibility along with every other parental responsibility teachers are now charged with, so their time is limited. This means for many students that are not looking at ATARs for universities that they are often a casualty of teachers being required to do too much and there are not enough hours in the day.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'In the first review of the New South Wales education curriculum since 1989, which was commissioned by the former New South Wales minister for education, Sarah Mitchell MLC, who is a member of the Nationals, and undertaken by Professor Geoff Masters AO, it was clearly pointed out that student attainment in New South Wales was improving in reading in primary. However, the proportion of New South Wales 15-year-olds meeting acceptable standards of reading, maths and scientific literacy has been in steady decline. These 15-year-olds had slipped from being amongst the highest performers and were now average performers.' Of course, we have the NAPLAN results that have just come in as well, and some of those are alarming. Indeed, we have this shortfall in kids being able to understand what was once called the three RRRs—reading, writing and arithmetic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Mrs Hull pointed out, she has been on this campaign since 1978, when she and her late husband, Graeme, opened their smash repair business in Wagga Wagga. She said: 'The attitudes towards those who deliver the building of this nation in every way, shape or form must change. The trades and services specialities must be respected and given equality if we are to solve the many issues that are facing our businesses. The peer pressure on parents to send their kids to university regardless must cease. The evaluation of the performance of our schools on the ATAR levels they achieve must stop, and we must put equal value on all outcomes in education from all students, including those on school based apprenticeships or traineeships and those who have secured employment as a trainee or apprentice.' And, of course, she is correct. TAFE is a wonderful institution. Indeed, we contributed $1.61 billion through the National Agreement on Skills and Workforce Development when in government in the 2022-23 financial year. That was the money that had been set aside—as a parliament, as a nation. And this is good; this is to be admired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people going to TAFE, and some not so young as well, must be applauded for their efforts and endeavours because at the end of the day, whilst university is important, when things break down, as they often do, we're going to need a plumber, an electrician or somebody else to do that job. Having somebody with a TAFE qualification to do that job means that the job will usually be done, almost always done, invariably done properly, because that is the TAFE system. I applaud the fact that we have a good TAFE system and I also applaud the fact that any TAFE graduate is every bit equal to anybody who has a tertiary qualification.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  It should come as neither a shock nor a surprise to anyone to see me getting to my feet to support the member the Lalor's motion on fee-free TAFE. It was only last week that the Minister for Skills and Training came into this place to celebrate National TAFE Day. But I'd contend that every week is a good week to celebrate TAFE, and it's a mantra that the Albanese Labor government has taken to heart from the day it was elected and, for that matter, years prior to being elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years, TAFE as an institution and the vocational education and training sector more broadly were left to languish under the previous government. The sector has had to suffer the rhetorical indignity of being the poor cousin of university when it comes to obtaining an education. Starting with everything that has come to pass since the Jobs and Skills Summit, I'm hopeful that that preconception has diminished somewhat. The state of Australia's labour market should act as a wake-up call to any hold-outs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming into office, the Albanese Labor government had a number of challenges to overcome in this space, starting with having the second-highest labour supply shortages among OECD countries, and as a country with three million people lacking the fundamental skills required to participate in training and secure work. This was further compounded by estimates stating that nine out of 10 new jobs will require postsecondary school education, with four of those being VET qualifications. The Albanese Labor government is taking care of five of those jobs through the Australian Universities Accord, with legislation supporting the recommendations of the accord panel interim report already passing through this House. As for the other four of those jobs, they are something that are TAFE educators are both poised and primed to address. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government know that higher education and VET are not competing with one another, nor should we place a higher value on one over the other. In fact, the Australian Universities Accord interim report said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's skills needs will only be met if the higher education system and an expanded VET system, with TAFE at its core, work together within a more integrated system to deliver the flexible, transferable skills people want and need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This system can only get to that point because now there is a government at the helm that cares about TAFE and is willing to see it grow after repairing nearly a decade of neglect under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. The Albanese Labor government embarked on fee-free TAFE courses in the hopes of not just jump-starting the TAFE and vocational education and training sector but also starting to address some of our greatest skill shortages both in the short term and in the long term. We knew this would not be easy for many Australians out there—to make the choice to upskill themselves and going on a sea change in their careers into a wholly new vocation. It can never be easy, no matter the headwinds one is facing. That is why offering these TAFE enrolments without fees is so important. It helps to make that thought process just a bit easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm continually proud to say that my state of South Australia was the canary in the coalmine for this policy. The Malinauskas Labor government in South Australia was the first to enter into a national skills agreement with the Commonwealth government to deliver fee-free TAFE places. It was an agreement that injected more than $65 million into the state's skills and training sector. This was sorely needed after the Marshall Liberal government, who, in only four years, moved to privatise and gut as much of the sector as they could before the clock finally struck election time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia has put those fee-free places to good use, with a number of sectors benefiting the most, such as agriculture, horticulture and winemaking; construction; early childhood education; tourism and event management; IT and cybersecurity; and many more. Across the nation, in the first six months of fee-free TAFE, we have seen 215,000 enrolments, well beyond the expected 180,000. Of those enrolments, 51,000 are in the care sector, 16,700 in the technology and digital sectors and 21,000 in the construction sector. The breakdown of the data also shows that 51,000 of those placements have gone to jobseekers and over 15,000 to people with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, we have seen none other than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Farrer, calling fee-free TAFE 'wasteful spending'. In my closing statements, I want to touch on that, because I have been the lucky recipient of a TAFE education. It gave me a very, very rewarding 10 years as a seafarer in the maritime transport sector. Without the training that I received at TAFE, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to progress and eventually come to this place. So I proudly stand in support of TAFE.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to speak about fee-free TAFE and to try to give a unique perspective on not just TAFE but vocational education, apprenticeships and university education more broadly. That comes from some recent experiences I've had travelling overseas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 2020, I was a recipient of a Churchill Fellowship. My fellowship sought to understand the links between industry and education and what other countries were doing and how they were doing a bit better than us in making sure that young people have aspirations and pathways into industry. I observed that Germany, Sweden and Finland, particularly, have very vibrant vocational education sectors and some unique and cultural ways of getting young people into those vocational education systems. I'll talk about a few examples that I saw.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Germany, I went to Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart. They were very focused on apprenticeships where young people would do an apprenticeship with Mercedes-Benz for a couple of days a week, then go to the vocational education school or the tech school. The tech school was significantly funded by the government, and there were very good outcomes, according to Mercedes-Benz, in terms of the quality of the kids and the technicians. In the German culture, getting a vocational education and going to tech school is just as highly valued as going to university. That's why they have had such success in their manufacturing sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the same in Finland. In Finland I noticed that universities and tech schools are seen as an equivalent and that their manufacturing companies need both to be successful. An interesting statistic that the Finnish education department talked to me about was the fact that they have not had an increase in university enrolments since the early 2000s, and they're fine with that because they understand that they need some of their young people to go to university and some of their young people to go to vocational education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this debate there will be a bit of, 'We spent more on TAFE,' and, 'You're saying TAFE will be free.' I welcome the debate. It's the back-and-forth in this chamber. What I want to contribute is that we don't just need TAFE to be free—if it is going to be free; I think we can have that debate—but we need to look at TAFE being better. I think we can all work towards that. I think we can look at the vocational education systems in Europe and see how they have made them not only better but also more attractive for young people to go into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">TAFE exists in my electorate and does some very good things, but I think the engagement between industry and TAFE hasn't been as good as it has been. I think state governments could do a lot more to encourage more collaboration between industry and TAFE. What I saw in Europe was collaboration, and I saw quality young people coming out with tech school based apprenticeships that led to really good outcomes for manufacturers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the most important thing we can work towards in Australia is making sure that vocational education is seen as being as important for the nation as university education. Culturally, we need to hold the two at an equal level and make sure that our focus and funding, particular from the state government perspective, is directed in that way. I will close with those recent experiences I had in Europe. I encourage us, in moving forward, to make sure young people have aspiration and a pathway into the occupation of their choice. That may be an apprenticeship, it may be university or it may be vocational education. Let's make sure we encourage them towards that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  Investing in one's education is often called 'the key to success'. When you acquire skills through learning, those skills will follow you for life. Our government's fee-free TAFE policy has done just that. The policy has been a game changer for many people since it was rolled out. I am very thankful that the policy has been an absolute success, with 214,300 enrolments so far, in the first six months. What a milestone! Demographic data also shows that fee-free TAFE is supporting Australians from all walks of life—youth, jobseekers, people with disabilities, First Nations Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. This shows that our government's fee-free TAFE policy is not only a beacon of success and hope but also a catalyst for a positive change. Its impact on the local community is nothing short of remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fee-free TAFE policy introduced by our government aims to provide fee-free training in critical industries to boost skills, employability and economic growth. This policy has had a profound effect on Australians, particularly students in my seat of Tangney, who will receive real, tangible benefits. With the fee-free TAFE policy in place, countless students have been empowered to seek further education for themselves, to develop new skills and to enhance their employability. Access to fee-free education has removed the financial barriers that previously made it difficult for many to pursue further education and training. Many people who may previously have struggled to find stable employment are now equipped with the skills and qualifications needed to secure meaningful jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcome of this policy is a direct boost in education and skills training for people, directly translating to increased employability. I know that the care sector will benefit significantly from this policy, with courses across health care, aged care and disability care attracting 23.8 per cent of total enrolments. We also have construction attracting 9.8 per cent, technology and digital media attracting 7.8 per cent, and early childhood education and care attracting 5.5 per cent of enrolments. In addition to this, women make up 60.2 per cent of the enrolments, with nearly 130,000 women taking on qualifications under the program. This is so powerful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a multicultural society like Australia, TAFE provides a unique opportunity for individuals from different cultures and backgrounds to come together, learn and exchange ideas. I was once a TAFE student, and I look back at that time so fondly—not only for what I learnt but for the people I met along the way. When I arrived in Australia from Malaysia, back in 2002, my English was really bad. I went to Thornlie TAFE to learn English. I did a six-month course to receive a certificate II in English. As a student I learnt more than just a language; I learnt acceptance and appreciation of the diverse cultural backgrounds of my fellow students who, like me, had come to pursue a better education and life for themselves. My teacher, Sarma Gough, who I'm still in contact with, brought me so much knowledge and help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without having started my journey at TAFE and subsequently taken on an additional training course at Thornlie TAFE to have the skills to become a police officer, I would not be standing here in this House today. This is a policy that has opened doors to new opportunities, improved employability and better outcomes for everyday Australians. For that I say thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion regarding Australia's TAFE system and the government's fees policy. Like we've just from heard from the member opposite, I love TAFE. I'm proud to have been a TAFE student and I'm very proud to have an excellent TAFE campus and team based on the southern Mornington Peninsula in my electorate. Chisholm runs this campus, and it is to be found on a huge campus site in the Rosebud industrial estate, surrounded by our key trades and small businesses, which I was pleased to find, on a recent walk around the industrial estate with Sam Groth, our local state MP, are as busy as they can be. Thriving automotive, manufacturing and carpentry—you name it; it's going gangbusters down there. The Rosebud Chisholm TAFE has exceptional facilities in trades but also in care industries, hospitality and tourism, and hair and beauty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have been working since my election with this Chisholm team, led by Ben Jenkinson and Conor Mullan, as part of a roundtable focus on vocational and employment opportunities across the Mornington Peninsula. As a region we remain desperate for local workers across all trades: electrical, automotive, carpentry, building and construction, painting and plastering—you name it; we need it. Chisholm TAFE is our only tertiary education institution across the whole Mornington Peninsula. While I'm grateful that, through these fees measures, some cost-of-living pressure has been relieved for students who attend Chisholm TAFE, I can tell you what would make a world of difference to those students: public transport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, as part of its inquiry into the standing of VET, came to Chisholm TAFE on the peninsula over the winter break, the committee was enlightened to the importance of public transport as a make-or-break decider for whether someone can actually go to TAFE. Angela Byatt, of the local learning and employment network, advised us at that committee meeting:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Talking about our region specifically and also those regions where transport is a barrier, particularly when you're talking about young people who can't drive, it is an incredible barrier. You can have the best program in the world or the best work experience opportunities, but, if they can't get there, they can't get there. We see that in our region, particularly down the southern peninsula. We see pockets as well, like down the southern peninsula and in the western port area. They're like little islands. These young people are stuck. So I do think transport is an absolute barrier and something that needs to be looked at to increase access.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would encourage my colleagues on the other side to pick up the phone to Premier Dan Andrews or transport minister Jacinta Allan and tell them to do their part in boosting enrolments in TAFE, particularly in the trades. Give us bus routes and improve our rail lines so kids can get to Rosebud and Frankston TAFE campuses and learn while living at home with their parents, where we desperately need them to stay to fill our local workplace needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the observations that the House of Reps education committee heard time and time again was that TAFE is not the only way to get a good qualification and get into a good job. In fact, a number of small businesses now have serious concerns about the quality of graduates they're getting from TAFE. This isn't across the board, but it is frequent enough to know that a robust, results-producing vocational education sector will include both public and private VET. Some students prefer private registered training organisations for the flexibility they offer, the timing of classes that's designed to suit working people and the effective and professional combination of face-to-face and online training. Furthermore, many private RTOs also have longstanding and beneficial relationships with local employers, giving a graduate a faster start in their professional life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… is that it's 'free' education, and they quickly realise that it's not free. With our pricing, we try and keep it as low as possible because we know that there are financial barriers for some students. So they may be able to pay a deposit and then pay weekly or fortnightly payments until the course is completed. We try and minimise what we actually charge students. I hear of other RTOs. For example, a single qualification in, say, Certificate IV in Ageing Support is $186, and that is it. It covers all the resources. The textbook alone is $100. They get a uniform to go on their placement, they get a name badge, they get all the support of a face-to-face class—not an online class—and they get support with any IT issues that they may have. They get all that for $186.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The implication in this discussion was that TAFE students think their studies are free until they get a hefty bill for all the resources.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's target of 82 per cent renewable energy in the nation's electricity grid by 2032 raises more questions than answers just at the moment. Many experts have raised concerns about the rate of change with the pathway that the government is on, the assumptions around green hydrogen and the ability of anyone to construct 10,000 kilometres of new transmission lines within the next nine years. Along with this, new concerns are arising about our sovereign security. We've long been concerned about Australia importing the bulk of our solar panels, and it's worth noting that 82 per cent of the world's solar panels are made in China. We also import wind farm generators. In fact, we import some of the steel for the towers and certainly much of the steel for the transmission line towers. Those things are all concerns to me and to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But new concerns are now arising about the underlying technology used to operate our dynamic electricity grid. Components are operated by wireless signals, with databanks embedded within, in this case, Chinese companies, which are ultimately compelled to do their government's bidding, to provide information when the government says that it needs that information. Take photovoltaic inverters, for instance. Fifty-eight per cent of the inverters used in Australia are made in China. They are internet-connected devices which can be remotely operated. If there is one thing Ukraine's war has taught us, it is that systemic targeting of the transmission grid and its generators is one of the faces of modern warfare. Just imagine—perhaps we don't even have to imagine—that an aggressor could strike our electricity grid down from a switchboard thousands of kilometres away. Sadly, that seems like it may well be the reality, if not now then in the not-too-distant future. The rapid change that has occurred in our generating systems—that is, thousands of small-scale generators sitting on people's roofs all over the nation—has absolutely changed the operating environment in which we exist. The US Department of Energy has identified trust in and reliance on the communication platforms, and the risk of hostile forces attacking them, as a No. 1 priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks much about its commitment to modern manufacturing and the building of things in Australia. That's great. In Australia we make many things, par excellence. There are some things that we're no longer competitive in, like washing machines, for instance. We need to get focused and identify the areas in which we need sovereign capacity and remove the obstacles. Yes, we do need sovereign capacity in traditional areas like steel manufacturing, aluminium and energy, but it's increasingly clear we need sovereign capacity in intelligent technology as well, in our communications platforms, where the chips embedded in parts and pieces and components that we use every day have the ability to communicate with countries that may be hostile to us. That's solar and battery communications. Even the innocuous dongle can actually be communicating with others. We need to take that into account.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  This is an odd motion by the member for Grey, but it does allow members of the government party to speak about the government's many initiatives in energy policy and important actions in cybersecurity, so I thank the member, and I speak against the motion. The member for Grey is from South Australia. His state has a proud record on the rollout of renewables, and, even though I expect he can't take much of the credit for that, he should be coming here crowing about his state's achievements. Instead, we get phrases like 'rush towards 82 per cent renewables' and, somehow in the same motion, 'dithering'. The member cannot have it both ways. Much of the solar and wind power that now largely runs the state of South Australia originates from the sun and wind in the seat of Grey. The member should be very proud and should be a warrior for the transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to set targets and do whatever is necessary to achieve them. In renewables, this is a novel concept after 10 years of, well, dithering by the previous government. This government, in just a year, has made great investments in renewables, as the motion indicates. This is a good thing and much needed. Before the change of government, emissions continued to trend upwards. In July last year, the CSIRO and the Energy Market Operator confirmed that renewables like wind and solar are the cheapest form of energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has invested in ARENA to power solar research; taken concrete steps to unlock the power of offshore wind; supported a groundbreaking thermal energy storage project in the Hunter and another in Broken Hill; invested to fast-track connection to the National Electricity Market of the country's largest wind farm precinct in Queensland; and legislated our emissions reduction targets, which the member for Grey voted against, which is very telling. What does the member tell the solar and wind companies in Grey about the fact that he voted against emissions reduction targets?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have supported renewable hydrogen production in Karratha, Brisbane, the Hunter, Gladstone, Townsville and Whyalla, rewiring the nation to allow more renewables to reach consumers and to fortify the energy system. We speak to partners at COP and other international fora on climate issues, and not with empty words to empty rooms. And, of course, we legislated a $10 billion National Reconstruction Fund with a mandate to invest in renewables and low-emissions technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The movement to 100 per cent renewables will have a long tail. The last 18 per cent may take a lot longer than the first 82 per cent, but this transition is part of the government's responsible response to the climate realities that confront us. The climate news is bad. The use of the word 'rush' in this motion is, in itself, intemperate, for a rapid movement is exactly what is called for. We need to transition at whatever top speed is realistic, and we need to become leaders in our region, assisting our neighbours to transition, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion cautions that Chinese made electronics might contain spyware. Firstly, let's take a breath and assume that it might be improbable that the Chinese would want to keep a close eye on each Australian residence's power consumption. Nevertheless, the government has been very active in the area of cybersecurity. First and foremost, we have a minister for cybersecurity in the cabinet. Apparently, we're dithering, but those opposite didn't even have a minister for cybersecurity when we took office.</span>

                  </a>  Well, they did have one for a couple of years, until 2018, and then they didn't. There's some classy dithering for you! With the Minister for Cyber Security in cabinet, this government has initiated the development of the new Australian Cyber Security Strategy, led the new International Counter Ransomware Task Force, implemented the risk management program to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services, held the Prime Minister's Cyber Security Roundtable in February, established the National Office of Cyber Security and appointed the National Cyber Security Coordinator in June. Just three days ago, we declared another 87 critical infrastructure assets to be systems of national significance, bringing the total to 168 across the energy, communications, transport, financial and data sectors. Unsurprisingly, in March, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ranked us No. 1 in the world among countries showing the greatest progress in and commitment to enhancing cybersecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons the government changed in May 2022 is that the Australian people want to see action across a range of areas, after years of coalition dithering. This government has been more active on climate change in 16 months than the previous coalition government was in nine years. We've been more active on cybersecurity than any government ever and, at the same time, more useful both in defence and in mending relationships with our neighbours, including our relationship with China.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this important area of debate, and I thank the member for Grey for raising this critical motion. Energy security is of course national security; that is not a new concept, but the increased digitalisation of our energy production has brought new risks and vulnerabilities that the federal government has to contend with to maintain our national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australia's solar sector, much championed by the current government, is dominated by imports from China. We know that Australia has one of the greatest levels of rooftop solar take-up in the world, yet many of our households are reliant on smart inverters to convert energy from rooftop solar panels into electricity. In fact, some states have now mandated the adoption of smart inverters. These smart inverters have internet connectivity and can be controlled remotely, creating a significant risk of infiltration and sabotage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chinese imports make up 58 per cent of Australia's smart inverter market. Many of these firms have established links to the Chinese Communist Party. The two largest suppliers in the Australian solar inverter market, Sydney-based Sungrow and Melbourne based GoodWe, are Chinese owned and have links with the Chinese Communist Party. Firms such as Huawei, a Chinese firm already blocked from participating in Australia's 5G rollout due to national security concerns, are suppliers of smart inverters in Australia. The question has to be asked: if they can't be trusted with our digital infrastructure, how can they be trusted with our energy infrastructure?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that the capacity to disrupt a significant portion of our energy capacity would have disastrous effects for Australian industry and Australian households, particularly if we find ourselves in the midst of a national crisis. This risk has materialised slowly over many years. Our reliance on foreign-made material components in our critical infrastructure networks is increasing almost exponentially. I'm advised that there are no security measures currently in place to prevent malicious actors from using solar inverters to disrupt the solar electricity grid. This isn't good enough, particularly when the policy of the federal government is to continue to ramp up the adoption of solar technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said that for Australia to reach its 43 per cent emissions reduction target there will need to be 60 million panels by 2030. How many of these will be able to be turned off by a foreign actor? How much baseload capacity will be left to supplement supply if and when this occurs? I note that the home affairs minister's public comments in this area have pointed to government's efforts to boost domestic inverter manufacturing capability. While that is of course worthwhile, it's a long-term strategy to an immediate problem that's getting worse every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this is an issue that has been thrust into the national conversation by the research efforts of shadow minister Senator Paterson. Earlier this year, the federal government also began a process of removing numerous Chinese-made surveillance cameras from Defence premises and other sensitive national security areas, after Senator Paterson's advocacy. But it shouldn't have to come down to the research efforts of the shadow cabinet for action to be taken by this government. They should be proactive on this front, not reactive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen energy network disruptions in Ukraine. It's now, clearly, a feature of war in the modern age that these sorts of digital attacks do occur. We've seen action being taken on this front by the government of the Netherlands, and, in the United States, we're seeing more and more legislators ringing alarm bells around the implications for or the risks to the system from foreign actors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the headlong rush towards 82 per cent renewable energy is creating unnecessary security risks. These issues need to be sorted out before wider adoption, not as an afterthought after it's too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is calling on the government to take this threat seriously. Action must be taken to ensure Australia's energy grid is free from foreign interference. And it's not just solar photovoltaic systems that need to be investigated. How many other renewable energy technologies have components that can be sabotaged by foreign actors? It's time that the Labor government was awake to this danger. I commend the motion to the House and encourage the government to take the necessary action to ensure that this rush towards renewable energy doesn't result in an undermining of our national security.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I think the previous speaker belled the cat when he started laughing right at the end, because the irony of this motion must have suddenly hit him. What we have seen, I think, and what we continue to see is a complete amnesia about the last 10 years and about how, indeed, we could have got ourselves into the situation that we're in. But I'll talk about us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National security, to our government, is sacrosanct. It underpins every other area of government on which the Australian people rely for essential services, from combating cost-of-living pressures to delivering nation-building reforms to Medicare; to cheaper childcare, cheaper medicines and cheaper bulk billing; to the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Every one of the government's reforms hinges, in some way, on our ability to keep our country safe from the many threats that would sap the foundation of our democracy, for—and make no mistake—Australia is under daily pressure from a full spectrum of threats, ranging from geopolitical competition through to foreign interference, organised crime and cyberattacks. And energy security is among the urgent priorities of this government's national security agenda. So, to that limited extent, I welcome the motion for making the valid point that energy security is national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, unlike those opposite, all arms of our government are acting on this view. Securing our critical infrastructure—which includes the power plants that are raised in this motion—is one of the priority focal points of our new 2023 to 2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy, whose development was announced in December. We have appointed an expert advisory board, made up of the brightest minds in business, government and defence, to tackle this complex issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has also appointed Air Marshal Darren Goldie, AM, CSC, as the National Cyber Security Coordinator, and I wish him well in his role. He's incredibly capable. His role will focus on making critical infrastructure entities more cyber-resilient to these ongoing attacks on our systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy released version 2 of the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework. It specifically provides a tool for assessing cybersecurity maturity across Australia's energy sector, addressing the exact set of issues that the motion raises, across gas markets, the electricity sector and liquid fuels.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion voices fears that smart solar inverters could turn solar panels into vectors of foreign interference, with hackers shutting them off remotely. While no threat can be dismissed out of hand in our hyperconnected age, with the Internet of Things turning what was once science fiction into our daily reality, I do have serious reservations about the motivations behind this sudden epiphany among those opposite on cybersecurity and energy security after over nine long years of doing—what, exactly? I distinctly remember the coalition's energy security strategy. It was importing 91 per cent of our fuel and holding only 32 days worth, outsourcing our fuel security to the US, with fuel transported on foreign owned ships that take at least three weeks to reach us That's before you get to the coalition's answer to every energy policy question: building nuclear reactors in Australia's suburbs out of ideological hostility to wind turbines and solar panels.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that interjection. It's like an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Simpsons</span>. But, seriously, you really have to wonder, if solar panels are a national security threat, why is there no such scrutiny on nuclear? It is curious, isn't it? Why not the scrutiny on nuclear? It is very curious. Meanwhile, for nine long years, the coalition was totally asleep at the wheel on cybersecurity and energy security and the need to protect the infrastructure that Australians rely on every day. Perhaps those opposite should explain to the Australian people why their government turned a blind eye to procurement from high-risk vendors for a decade, creating the very risks that they decry today. We do need to lessen that supply chain concentration. Luckily, we've got a government that will get after it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking my friend the member for Grey for bringing this important motion to the House and for his long-term advocacy for remote and regional Australia. I'm very proud to join this critical call to action, as we must ensure that our national security is not forgotten in Labor's reckless energy transition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor party has been very clear about its ambitions to radically transform Australia's energy sector. Australia currently generates between 30 to 35 per cent of its power from renewable sources. The Albanese government has committed to increasing this to a whopping 82 per cent by 2030, which is only seven short years away. This commitment has serious implications for the efficiency and for the reliability of our energy sector, with the Australian Energy Market Operator warning of massive blackouts this summer and in the years ahead. This is on the back of already record-high electricity prices suffered by families and businesses under the Albanese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this motion, we wish to highlight the serious national security concerns that at present are being ignored by this Labor government. As we know, almost 60 per cent of installed smart inverters are being supplied by Chinese manufacturers, bound by China's national intelligence laws. Such reliance could leave Australia vulnerable to sabotage of our power supplies. As detailed by the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre, a coordinated attack could be catastrophic for Australia's electricity markets. Such a targeted attack could result in what's called a 'black-start event', which is where power plants are incapable of restarting without reliance on an auxiliary power source like a generator or a battery. A black-start event could bring down an entire power grid for one week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the damning research, it is clear that at the moment we are on a path to establishing a network that is vulnerable to foreign attacks. Can you even imagine the chaos, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, which could ensue if the grid was essentially turned off for a week? At the very least, a review should be conducted into the national security implications of Labor's planned transition. I call on the government to follow the CRC recommendations and ensure that cybersecurity impact assessments be completed for all solar inverters being sold in Australia and that mandatory cybersecurity ratings be introduced for solar inverters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have previously enjoyed bipartisanship in stamping out foreign influence, and I hope that we can once again do so in this space. I call on the government to have the same courage as we did when we decided to exclude Huawei from Australia's 5G network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy policy under this government has proven to be a complete mess. It's reflected in not just the record high prices following their promise to do the opposite and decrease prices by $275 a year or the increased possibility of blackouts or the added national security concerns but also this government's failure to continue on a credible transition plan. Last month Prime Minister Albanese made a great big announcement about the federal government investing $3 billion in Western Australia's power grid. He promised money to improve the power grid in Geraldton and surrounding Mid West, which is currently not fit for purpose. Only a few short hours later that promise was crab walked backwards. Honestly, the level of uncertainty in the Western Australian power grid in regional WA is off the charts. The hydrogen dream in the Mid West is over if we cannot sort out our grid in the Mid West. I fear that the Mid West community and new industrial users have been sold a complete pup by the Cook and the Albanese governments. If it wasn't so serious, it would be laughable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the transition to a lower-emissions economy is one that many Australians want. They are concerned about the long-term impacts emissions are having on the climate and the environment. However, let's not be confused by what they want. They don't want a rushed transition that results in higher prices, less reliability and a system that is vulnerable to foreign attacks. A review into the national security consequences of this transition would outline the need for a balanced mix of technologies to feed the grid. The balance should include gas and zero-emissions nuclear energy. Not only will this make the system more reliable; it will also make it less vulnerable to foreign attacks. </span>

This is a desperate attempt by those opposite to delay the rollout of renewable energy from a party who for 10 years fought tooth and nail against even recognition that there was an emergency arising out of climate change—head in the sand, denying climate change was even happening. They are grasping at straws today. The opposition claim to be worried about energy security. Well, my friend the member for Solomon pointed out some of the fallacies in their argument. They claim to be concerned about the use of energy assets manufactured overseas, yet they stand in the parliament and vote against the National Reconstruction Fund, the very measure that would enable more manufacturing in Australia. That fund is our government's commitment to $15 billion as a first step towards rebuilding Australia's industrial base. The Albanese Labor government wants Australia to be a country that makes things again, and that includes renewable and low-emissions technologies. The National Reconstruction Fund has earmarked $3 billion for these assets to be manufactured right here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Newcastle is poised to take full advantage of the enormous opportunities that come with renewable energy. We have a highly skilled workforce, world-class researchers, abundant resources and industrial expertise in the critical rail and port infrastructure that is needed to be a renewable energy superpower. That is where we see ourselves going forward. The University of Newcastle has in fact has developed an amazing printed solar cell technology that is ultra lightweight, ultra flexible, totally recyclable and cheap to manufacture. It is similar in thickness to just a chip packet, although a lot more recyclable, and it is manufactured using conventional printers. It could change the way that we use solar away from the typically cumbersome, large, nonrecyclable solar panels. I don't hear members opposite jumping up to be champions of that kind of technology. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have returned from Denmark and Scotland recently, where I went to understand more about the offshore wind industry and how technology can be adapted for here in Australia. It is a trip that I paid for myself because I want to get better informed about an industry that is going to be part—a big part—of Newcastle's future. I suggest members opposite might want to get better informed too. We know offshore is going to play a vital role in the future of our nation's energy mix, and we want to be able to manufacture the components of those wind turbines. In cities like Newcastle, we want to be able to service that new energy industry. It's all an important part of this nation's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of innovation that the Albanese Labor government wants to invest in—supporting local jobs, supporting local manufacturing and supporting local innovation. Overwhelmingly, when I was in Denmark, people told me just how relieved they were to have Australia sitting back at the table in all the international forums. They said how critical it was that we were focusing again on the need to decarbonise and that climate change was no longer a dirty word in our nation. They said how reassured they felt that Australia was now investing in renewables and low-emissions technologies to deliver on Australia's commitment to reach our target of net zero emissions by 2050. That's what people overseas are saying. They would be beside themselves to hear of this debate here this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to assure the member for Grey that, as well as working to manufacture renewable technologies in Australia, this government feels that national security is an issue that is critically important. The Department of Home Affairs is actively addressing Australia's technology security policy settings. This includes managing the risk associated with vendors who could be compelled by foreign governments to act against Australia's interests. We're also working closely with the Australian Energy Market Operator on required updates to the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework, and we recently declared another 87 critical infrastructure assets as 'systems of national significance'. This means we can apply a robust set of enhanced cybersecurity obligations on the owners and the operators. We relentlessly focus on safeguarding our country against significant cyberattacks and are working with industries, states and territories, and other stakeholders to manage those emerging risks. It's time the opposition got on board.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  Firstly I want to commend the member for Grey for moving this important motion. It is something that we should be discussing in this House. Cybersecurity, national security and energy security are so important. I was in the House for the member for Solomon's words. He's a very good man. Anyone who was raised in the wonderful town of Yarra Glen is a good person, so I'm sure it was just a slip and he must have forgotten, but he did say that in the nine years of the Morrison government there was nothing done on cybersecurity, which didn't seem right to me, because I remember there was a program called REDSPICE, which was all about cyber and intelligence, so I thought I'd better quickly check. Google's a wonderful thing. REDSPICE was a $9.9 billion investment in cyber and intelligence. I'm sure, as I said, the member for Solomon, my good friend growing up in Yarra Glen, made an innocent mistake, so I just wanted to correct that for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're talking about here is the transition to net zero, which is a long and challenging road. We shouldn't be glib about this conversation, but we need to make sure that we avoid unintended consequences, and that is a very real risk. We need to ensure that we have a secure and reliable energy network. So when we talk about the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre talking about the alarm of power being shut down for weeks, it is something we need to take seriously because the internet of things creates extra risk. It allows foreign operatives to not just hack into but to have backdoor access to many of our infrastructure networks, including solar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the risks they talked about is that the entire power grid could be brought down, and it could take a week or two to recover. This isn't those on this side saying that; this is the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre who have raised this alarm. Let's think about some of the implications. Let's look at one area, like farming, an area that I'm very passionate about. It links directly to food security. If we lose power in the grid for two weeks, our food production stops. Farmers cannot pick their crops, they cannot keep them cool and they cannot transport them to distribution centres to then move them to supermarkets. That's one example of the implications for us as a nation: our food security would be at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we move to this digital world, we've got amazing opportunities in AI and quantum, but they also use a significant amount of power—to store that data, to run their algorithms—and that puts additional pressure on our networks. If we look at EVs as an example: as more people move to electric vehicles, they need the power for their cars to get around. The June storms of 2021 hit my community significantly, and I was three weeks without power. Many were three to four months without power. When you go that long without power, you understand how important it is that we have reliable and secure energy at all times. In our household, and in many households in Casey at that time when we didn't have power, we were fortunate that we had our gas so we were still able to cook and we were still able to have hot water, which meant we could stay where we were. But, again, as we transition from gas in homes to electrification, it means that there is more risk for homes in times of emergencies and blackouts, which is why it's so vital that we get these decisions right, because, once the horse has bolted, you can't lock the gate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is definitely more we need to do to manufacture in Australia, absolutely. When 60 per cent of installed smart inverters are being supplied by Chinese manufacturers, and they're bound by the CCP national intelligence laws, that creates a risk. It creates an absolute risk that we need to address, and this government needs to ensure that there is a cybersecurity impact assessment, to look at these risks and understand where they are and what we can do to make sure that we've got that reliable energy in Australia. It's very easy to set a target. It's a lot harder to achieve that target, while ensuring that we've got cheaper prices and reliable power and, when we turn the switch on, the light comes on. It's the first, principal responsibility of all governments.</span>

Every Saturday night thousands of locals head to Eastwood for a night out with their friends and family. Just before last year's election, a so-called activist stepped into the middle of Eastwood town centre, holding a sign that bore an offensive message directed at Chinese Australians. He sought to provoke not just any crowd but particularly Bennelong's Chinese Australian community. This environment, where Chinese Australians were targeted and attacked, was an environment fuelled by the anti-China rhetoric of the Morrison government. Research by Per Capita and the Australian Asian Alliance in 2020 revealed that Chinese Australians experienced increased levels of racial attacks, with one person interviewed naming the Morrison government's megaphone diplomacy as a reason for this increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this motion today, we see the Liberals once again happy to use Australia's migrant communities to make a cheap political point. Again, they do not care what consequences their words and ideology have for multicultural Australia. This was a situation that the Morrison government was happy to create, but clearly the Liberals didn't learn anything from the message that multicultural communities sent to them at the last election. Yet again we see them happy to use words which will impact our local Chinese Australian communities, in a ham-fisted attempt to slow down progress on our much-needed transition to renewable energy. This motion is so offensive and so absurd. Nearly every connected device in our homes and workplaces is either wholly or partially made in China, yet the Liberals would have us believe that it is only solar panels and inverters that pose a threat to our national security. They just so happen to be the same types of technology that they are ideologically opposed to as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their opposition to renewable energy is not only flawed in its logic but also deeply damaging to our collective vision for a clean energy future right here in Australia. Renewable energy solutions are vital in combating climate change and securing cleaner, cheaper energy for generations to come. Instead of working with the government to aid this transition, those opposite are choosing to target these products, in a misguided attempt to derail what Australians voted for at the last election. To make matters worse, the Liberals, on their antirenewables escapade, again are choosing words that will impact Chinese Australians. It is unjust and it is dangerous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: this government believes that we should be making solar panels and inverters here. That's logical. That will grow our economy and secure our energy future. And that's why we're investing record amounts in local manufacturing—something, of course, that the Liberal Party voted against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have resurrected their nuclear fantasy in opposition, in another attempt to oppose renewable energy. They made no progress on nuclear power in their nearly decade in government, but their radioactive opposition to clean energy knows no bounds. Now, with this motion, they're happy, again, to throw local Chinese Australians under the bus, in another attempt to demonise a perfectly viable, affordable and safe energy source. When former Prime Minister Morrison wanted to score cheap votes, he attacked China in a way that impacted Chinese Australians, and, just last week, we heard the reports of the member for Cook telling the Liberal party room to 'hold the line', as he spoke out against this government's attempts to restore our relationship with our largest trading partner. Then, last year, when the Liberals realised they'd left Australia with a national housing crisis, instead of proposing solutions or even voting for the government's solutions, the Leader of the Opposition stood up in this place and decided to blame migrants for the problems that the Liberals had created. This motion is just another attempt to slow down our transition to green energy production, and it again uses our migrant communities to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion shows that the modern Liberal Party is out of touch with modern multicultural Australia. This motion is an absolute disgrace. The politics of the Liberal Party are an absolute disgrace. And my message to the Liberal Party is this: stop using migrant communities to score political points. Stop making Chinese Australians a target as you give oxygen to your conspiracy theories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both my parents were born overseas, and I've seen them live a life of being mocked because of their accent and their surname. For as long as I'm in this place, I'll stand up and defend migrant communities, not only in Bennelong but across Australia, from the same happening to them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 September 1973, the government of Chile, headed by the democratic socialist President Salvador Allende, was overthrown in a brutal, illegal military coup that was resourced, supported and partly organised by the United States, through the covert action of the Central Intelligence Agency. Shamefully, the Australian government, through the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, or ASIS, assisted the CIA in engineering the coup against Allende.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've moved the suspension of standing orders because we wanted to debate this motion this morning and we were prevented from doing so. This is the 50th anniversary, and so it is fundamental and important that we debate this today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coup resulted in the rise of the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet and the murder, torture and disappearance of tens of thousands of Chileans. When plotting their coup, US President Nixon is reported to have told CIA Director Richard Helms, 'Make the Chilean economy scream.' But it wasn't just trade embargoes and sanctions; the CIA, with the assistance of ASIS, provided financial support to the coup plotters, logistical and communication support, and advice and encouragement. They not only created the conditions for the coup; they were the active agents in its occurrence, feeding on and fostering the discontent of Chilean elites, encouraging their violence and ultimately providing the necessary drive for the successful coup. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was Allende's apparent crime? Why did the CIA and the United States government, acting with the support of ASIS and the Australian government, push for the overthrow of a peaceful, democratic government? Why did Australia's intelligence agency participate in the destruction of a democratic system much like our own in favour of a murderous, violent dictatorship that lasted 17 long years? Allende and the Chilean government refused to bow to the financial and military interests of the United States empire. They nationalised American owned Chilean copper mines, depriving American multinational companies of their perceived birthright to pillage another country's natural resources for their own corporate profit, much like American multinational mining companies do to Australia today. The Allende Popular Unity government raised wages and froze prices on bread and other essentials. During this time, Chile saw big increases in industrial growth and GDP while inflation and unemployment declined. But then of course the American economic sabotage started to bite. The government created a program where free milk was distributed to every child, helping to significantly reduce infant mortality and child poverty. They established a publicly owned publishing company and distributed cheap classical fiction, poetry and philosophy. The government expanded public health care and education, reduced taxes for Chilean workers and helped progress crucial agrarian reform. Perhaps, most ambitiously, they pursued a world leading technology called Cybersyn that allowed for the electronic coordination of manufacturing, logistics and production across the country. It has later been acknowledged as a very similar technology to earlier versions of the internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the Allende government represented an existential threat to a world in which the United States pursued its financial and foreign policy interests with little regard for democracy or peace. How often are we told by those in power that there is no alternative to an economic system that sees corporate profits soar while ordinarily people struggle? Here was a peaceful, democratic country openly challenging the power of the United States and large multinational corporations and pursuing economic-social reform that redistributed wealth and power to ordinary working people in a way that fundamentally improved Chilean lives. For the United States, this was unacceptable. If a country could take ownership of its own resources and use that wealth for the benefit of the many, if a country could forsake the interests of the United States and flourish, well then, other countries and their people may ask themselves a simple question: if Chile can pursue such a path, then why can't we? That's what we call hope. For ordinary people, it is a powerful, transformative force. For the United States and its allies, it is a serious threat—not a threat to peace or prosperity but a threat to a system that puts enormous wealth and power in the hands of the few at the expense of the vast majority of ordinary people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what of the Australian government? Ever the loyal ally of the United States, when the CIA formally requested support in destroying Chilean democracy, the Australian government and ASIS answered the call and sent agents and resources in 1971, two years before the coup. This has been confirmed by the release of heavily redacted national security documents by the National Security Archive in the United States. Of course, we may never know the full extent of Australia's involvement, because the Australian government in 2021 successfully blocked the release of classified documents detailing exactly how ASIS assisted the CIA in destabilising and eventually destroying Chilean democracy. Former Australian intelligence officer and academic Clinton Fernandes, who attempted to force the Australian government to release the documents, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian government insists on secrecy to avoid having to admit to the Australian public that it helped destroy Chilean democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government and security establishment would rather the Australian public forget. This motion, acknowledging the anniversary of the military coup in Chile, including Australia's role in the coup, was selected by the Greens to be debated in private members' time. However, in the Labor dominated selection committee, while their deliberations were private, the end result was not allowing the Greens to debate this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It may seem trivial. After all, this motion stands little chance of succeeding, but it is nonetheless crucial that we take these moments to remember. The Allende government and Chilean democracy didn't fail because of some innate flaw in their program or policies; they were actively destroyed by forces who saw the potential success of Allende and the Popular Unity government as a threat to their financial and foreign policy interests. The Australian government and ASIS participated in that destruction. We should never forget that, no matter how hard the political and intelligence establishment tries to hide that fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another reason the Australian government would rather we all forget. It begs the obvious question: what are they doing in our name today? What has our slavish loyalty to the United States cost us—loyalty that has seen the Labor government commit at least $368 billion dollars of public money to purchase nuclear attack submarines and hand over our sovereignty to America, which once again seems hell-bent on escalating a dangerous arms race, this time with China?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls on the Australian government to apologise to the people of Chile for their role in destroying a vibrant, prospering democracy at the behest of the United States. It really is the least the Australian government should do. The Australian government should apologise not just for the political murders committed by the Pinochet regime, not just for the torture and unjust imprisonment, not just for the 17 years of dictatorship, not just for the extinguishing of Chilean democracy and of a political project with the potential to transform the lives of millions of Chileans for the better and to inspire hope in the hearts of millions of people across the world. The Australian government should apologise so that we as a country can have an honest, informed and real debate about the cost of obediently doing whatever the United States may ask of us as a country—the cost not just for Australia and Australians but for the millions of countries around the world whose countries have been ravaged by the litany of illegal wars, coups and assassinations America is responsible for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinary everyday Australians have far more in common with an ordinary Chilean than they do with the CEO of a large American multinational mining company. Both Australians and Chileans have so much to gain by using the enormous mining wealth for the benefit of working people. This is what Allende sought to do, and it was the Australian government and intelligence agencies that helped destroy that. We in the Greens have never forgotten this. Solidarity with the people of Chile, and sorry for what the Australian government did to your country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I second the motion. There are two critical reasons that this should be debated today, in addition to the excellent contribution from the member for Griffith, which I endorse. One is, of course, that today is the anniversary. Given that this is a motion that is relevant to the anniversary, it's a motion that needs to be debated today, and that's why standing and sessional orders need to be suspended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is that this is private members' day. Monday is when all the private members' business is conducted. Post last election, we are in a situation where roughly a third of the country, or a bit less, votes for the government; roughly a third of the country, or a bit more, votes for the opposition; and a third of the country votes for someone else. We're represented in here, on this large crossbench, in numbers that have never before been seen in this parliament. As I say, a third of the country wants third voices here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Mondays, we get an opportunity—a very limited opportunity—to have our say. Ordinarily, we get to respond to government bills and we might get to respond to matters that the opposition raises, but there's precious limited time for us here in the crossbench representing, diversely, a third of the country and carrying the interests of many, many more on issues that the major parties don't want to talk about. We get a very small window of opportunity to bring forward to this place the things that we want to debate. When we say in the limited slot that is given to us we want to debate a particular motion—especially given that it falls on a particular day and we have put in place, with a very long lead time, the work necessary to ensure that we get our motion in on time and have the capacity to debate it on that day—we should be allowed to debate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that about other members of the crossbench and members of the parliament who will bring things to this place that we might disagree with. Surely the purpose of allowing private members to bring matters for debate in this place is to have them debated? You can stand up and oppose it, but they shouldn't be prevented from bringing it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that could have been fixed and could have been addressed. We find ourselves in a situation now where we weren't able to debate the motion that the Greens sought to have debated. I hope that this is the last time that this happens. To my knowledge, it's close to the first time that it's happened that private members haven't been able to have the motion of their choice debated in this place. In a parliament where there is a strong desire from the Australian people to see issues brought up and debated that the others won't touch, it makes it more important that members of the crossbench who want to bring private members' motions are able to do so without concern that they're going to be told, 'No, that motion is not acceptable for debate.' As I say and as the member for Griffith says, it doesn't mean it's going to get passed; it just means it's going to be debated, in a limited slot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say this, too: if we actually had in this parliament representation that was reflective of the true will of the people of the country, then we'd probably spend a third of our time debating issues that members of the crossbench want to bring up. That's how many people are now fed up with the establishment parties and are saying, 'Let's put other issues on the table.' What you also find is that the issues we bring here are issues that 80 per cent of people agree with. These are things like wanting to freeze and cap rents, things like wanting a national anticorruption commission—for a long time we were the ones whistling in the wind about that—and things like marriage equality. We started to break the stranglehold of the establishment parties on marriage equality when a private member's motion—mine—was brought into this place, with the Greens representing the will of so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to bring private members' motions here is important. In many instances these motions end up being what the parliament ultimately agrees on, because we break the stranglehold of the establishment parties, but that can only happen if we're able to bring motions here when we want them. As I say, I hope we don't have to find ourselves on our feet again, having to resort to suspending standing orders, to be able to bring our issues to the parliament's attention. It's critical that we do this today. It's private members' business day and it's also the anniversary.</span>

The only thing that this debate right now is serving to do is to delay the government—indeed, the whole parliament—from being able to proceed with very important legislation, such as legislation to close loopholes in our industrial relations system to protect workers, legislation to protect the future of the Murray-Darling system, and legislation on greenhouse and energy minimum standards.

The opportunity to speak on this issue is already available today, on this important anniversary. Whatever issues they may wish to raise in relation to it could be raised in the contribution to that debate, which is already listed to occur today. For that reason, the government will not be supporting the proposal to suspend standing orders now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, the amendments allow the minister, by regulation, to confer privileges and immunities in relation to international organisations of which Australia is not a member, to confer privileges and immunities on categories of officials not prescribed in the act where requested by an international organisation and agreed to by Australia, and to more flexibly grant the existing suite of privileges and immunities under the act to international organisations and their officials.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been bipartisan support for the privileges and immunities act since 1963, when it was introduced and passed by the coalition under Robert Menzies with the support of the then Labor government. There have been three main amendments to the act since that time—in 1982, the coalition with support from Labor; in 1997, the coalition with support from Labor; and in 2013, Labor with support from the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments made in 1997 were made to keep pace with the increasing number and diversity of international organisations being established. Former senator Parer stated in his second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia only grants privileges and immunities which are required under our international obligations and commitments. When negotiating privileges and immunities as part of international agreements, this Government takes the line that specific items should be included only where there is a demonstrated functional need. We have to be satisfied that the specific privilege or immunity is necessary for the effective operation of the organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The longstanding approach of successive Australian governments has been a strict and conventional interpretation of what is and what is not an international organisation, so careful consideration was given as to why this approach should change now, which is why the coalition referred this bill to a committee. I thank the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for the work that they did in looking at this bill. The bill's approach arguably deviates from the approach taken by the coalition and the parliament over successive decades. However, we recognise that the proposed changes, implemented appropriately and with sufficient safeguards to prevent inadvertent expansion to organisations, have the potential to broaden and deepen Australia's engagement with the international community. The coalition will carefully monitor the implementation of the new framework to ensure that Australia continues to grant privileges and immunities when they are required under our international obligations and commitments and in ways that do not inadvertently extend the scope to other organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the key point for the coalition. We want to continue the bipartisanship when it comes to the granting of privileges and immunities, but we want to make sure that all the checks and balances are in place to ensure that the granting of these privileges and immunities is done only where it is necessary to do so. As I've highlighted, since 1963, each time there have been amendments to the way that privileges and immunity are granted, there has been bipartisanship. That bipartisanship will continue, but with the proviso that there is close scrutiny and monitoring, and we will ensure that that takes place with the granting of these privileges and immunities going forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I am pleased to rise and speak on the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Amendment Bill 2023. I do so after the member for Wannon and note the bipartisan offering of those opposite and note the fact that this has been a regime that has had the support of both sides of the House for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Context is important, and the context of supporting multilateral organisations through Australia's foreign policy is one where over the past few years we saw the former Prime Minister come into this place and parrot some of the tropes that we've seen many in the Republican Party in the United States use, about a more isolationist approach to foreign policy. It was a concerning moment in Australian foreign policy to have the Prime Minister of Australia looking more inwards as opposed to looking at what Australia's role is in the region. I'm pleased that since then those opposite have had more sense than that instinct that was expressed by the former Prime Minister and that we are now back to a place where foreign policy and commitment to multilateral organisations is something both sides of politics, both major parties, are focused on, are committed to and are working collaboratively on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon coming into government, the foreign minister made it her priority to re-establish Australia's place in not only our region but also the world. In order to do so, we need to work collaboratively with other international parties and players. We need to do so, also, through international and multilateral organisations. This bill is an enabler of that. This bill is to enable us to speak and connect with and work alongside many of the international organisations that we are a member of and also some that we are not a member of, as we look to increase and expand our scope. This bill is not just about legalities. It's about advancing Australia's national strategic interests, bolstering our defence, science and strategic relationships, and reaffirming our commitment to multilateralism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, international organisations have become an integral part of the multilateral system. International organisations carry out critical work in humanitarian, scientific and other fields, and they promote international cooperation and collaboration. I have witnessed this firsthand in our region. I am, too, deeply committed to their work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities protect the mission of embassies and their officials, these provisions are designed to shield international organisations, their missions and their personnel from undue interference on a global scale. Australia has a longstanding history of engagement with international organisations. In 1963, as the previous member said, we passed the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, which laid the foundation for our approach to granting privileges and immunities. However, as the world has evolved, so too must our legislation to keep pace with the changing dynamics of international systems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The three key parts of this bill are as follows. Firstly, these amendments will empower Australia to declare an organisation as an international organisation under the act, even if we are not a member of that organisation. This is all about expanding our scope of cooperation. It's about encouraging visits and facilitating the exchange of information, knowledge and ideas, and it will foster deeper partnerships with a broader array of international organisations. It will also help us uphold the privileges and immunities agreed to under treaties, further strengthening our international commitments. Secondly the amendments in this bill enable us to extend the existing range of privileges and immunities to categories of officials not explicitly prescribed in the act, provided such extensions are required by international organisations and they have been agreed upon by Australia. This flexibility is important in tailoring our support to the specific needs of international organisations and demonstrates Australia's willingness to work collaboratively with our international engagements. Finally, the bill includes technical edits to the schedules to the act to align them more closely with relevant treaty obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These adjustments are minor in nature and do not represent any significant policy shift or change in the operation of the act. Rather, they are all about ensuring that our domestic legislation reflects our international commitments accurately. This bill is a reflection of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to multilateralism, international law and promoting global cooperation. Through the passage of this bill, we reinforce our dedication to actively and constructively participate in the multilateral system, so upholding the institutions that serve as pillars for international cooperation. We do not take steps forward by taking steps back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia our commitment to our region and the global rules based order has been on display since we came into government. We on this side of the House want to see a continuing leadership role for Australia as a middle power taking its rightful place in international arenas. But we do so knowing that as a responsible international player we need to engage constructively, to look outwards, to invest in our region, to invest in the people in our region and to ensure that the security of our region outlasts any of our careers in this place. We seek to do so constructively. We seek to engage with our friends and our partners and we seek to engage with those with whom we don't currently have some of the more formalised relationships because that is what good international citizens do. We do so in a way that seeks to deepen defence cooperation, science and strategic partnerships. We do so with the acknowledgement that it is best done on a bipartisan basis. I hope the commitment to multilateralism and to the international rules based order remains exactly that, and I commend the bill to the House. </span>

I thank the member for Wannon for recording the strong history of bipartisanship shown by this parliament on this issue and those opposite for their good-faith engagement in the parliamentary committee review process for this bill. I also acknowledge my friend the member for Macnamara for highlighting the important role that this bill plays in Australia's engagement with the global multilateral system. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out in the past, Australia may not be a global power, but we have global interests and to pursue those interests we need to work closely with the other members of the international community. Multilateral institutions are, for that reason, more important for Australia than for some other larger countries. For that reason the bill will benefit Australia by providing new opportunities to cooperate with international organisations and will assist Australia to give effect to our international obligations, aligning our domestic laws more closely with the treaties to which we are a party. It will increase flexibility in which we grant privileges and immunities we agreed to in Australia in our national interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed by the bill are small but important. First, they will enable Australia to accord privileges and immunities to international organisations of which Australia is not a member. This includes, for example, the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation, with which Australia has concluded a framework agreement. Second, the amendments will allow Australia to grant privileges and immunities to classes of officials not set out in the act where requested by an international organisation and agreed to by Australia. Finally, Australia will have more flexibility in granting the existing suite of privileges and immunities under the act to international organisations and their officials. Australia grants privileges and immunities when they are required under our international obligations and commitments. We do so in accordance with international law, including international human rights law. </span>

To achieve this, we need to support its institutions and recognise the benefits that international organisations bring to Australia, the region and the world. The bill reflects the commitment of this government to its objectives, and, on that note, I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a national level, between 2012 and 2021, GEMS initiatives are estimated to have reduced emissions by between 40 and 60 mega tonnes of CO2 and to have saved households and businesses between $11.8 billion and $17.8 billion in energy costs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, in 2021-22 labelling and standards are estimated to have saved Australian households and businesses between $1.3 and $2 billion in avoided energy costs. These were estimated to deliver emissions savings of between 4.1 and 6.3 million tonnes in 2021-22—this is equivalent to about a quarter of South Australia's annual net emissions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GEMS scheme also has direct benefits at the consumer level. In 2019, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent </span><span style="font-style:italic;">review </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the GEMS Act </span>found that regulations under the GEMS scheme save the average Australian household between $140 and $220 on their electricity bill each year. We only expect this to get better as we look to expand the number and type of products regulated under the GEMS Act and see consumers looking to purchase higher energy-efficient products to save even more.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I'm delighted to stand in the chamber today to speak about the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023. In short, we support this bill because it aims to simplify and improve the operations of the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Regulator, otherwise known as the GEMS Regulator. It's also a piece of legislation that builds on the good work of the former coalition government in this regard. Indeed, as we continued in government ourselves to improve the operation of this scheme—as the minister just referenced, a scheme that has been working very well—we welcome these additional amendments that improve the scheme yet again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we delve into the specifics of the bill, it might be worthwhile reflecting on the role played by the GEMS Regulator, and it probably starts with a recognition that the responsibility to decarbonise the Australian economy does not lie just with government, of course. There is a role to be played by individuals, households and businesses. We all need to do what we reasonably can, and the GEMS Regulator helps us towards this end goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GEMS Regulator simplifies the process at the over-the-counter stage, if you like, of the shopfront by ensuring consumers have adequate information available to them to determine the energy efficiency rating of everyday products, in turn enabling a more transparent and cost-effective purchasing process for the Australian consumer. At its core, the GEMS Regulator is responsible for overseeing the energy efficiency of a wide array of products, working towards the goal of reducing energy consumption through driving greater efficiency. Most of us would recognise the energy efficiency star system. For me, that's at home on my fridge and my dishwasher—something I think everyday Australians have become accustomed to. These are examples of the good work done by the GEMS Regulator. It's a practical set of measures that the GEMS Regulator looks to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's provisions before us today relate to several key amendments—namely, lessening administrative burden, by streamlining administrative processes within the GEMS Regulator; improving response time to industry applications, so that improves for applicants by supporting businesses by expediting the application and approval process; alignment with international product categories, by ensuring Australian standards are harmonised with international benchmarks and facilitating their compatibility; and flexible application of the act's intent, by empowering the GEMS Regulator to interpret and apply the act's intent in a reasonable manner so they can respond, where needed, effectively and efficiently. The bill before us does build on the good work done by the coalition when it comes to GEMS. Indeed the former coalition government commissioned the review, which found the act was effective in reducing energy use, energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions and it was delivering these benefits in a streamlined and nationally consistent way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, opportunities were identified to add flexibility to the scheme, reduce impacts on the regulated community and allow it to adapt to changes in market conditions and technologies and look to those improvements. The bill before us therefore presents a plan to act on some of the recommendations that independent review identified, improve the implementation of the act through improving the regulator's performance and further reduce administrative burdens. The coalition were pleased to accept the findings of the review when in government, and we continue to support the direction of the GEMS Regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, however, did still undertake a thorough assessment of the bill itself. A number of concerns were raised based on our assessment and also from industry feedback. Each of these issues we investigated through industry consultation and also through the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications. For example, we did investigate concerns raised by the Airconditioning and Refrigerant Equipment Manufacturers Association of Australia, otherwise known as AREMA, and these AREMA issues were in turn also considered by the government and the committee. The coalition considered potential impacts of not just these issues but others raised on consumer prices, consumer choice and market competition, areas that should always be considered in such circumstances, and we came to the conclusion that this bill will not have any direct undue influence on such factors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note the bill does not give the regulator any new powers to alter standards, therefore if any substantive change to standards themselves were to be made—again, which might impact price, choice or competition—this would come through a separate legislative instrument, which we would then review as a coalition on a case-by-case basis. I emphasise that point in light of the minister, in his contribution to this debate, alluding to an aspiration to expand further the works of GEMS. In the event of any substantive change to a standard, the coalition would do a separate assessment and look at that, case by case, and if the government wishes to know what would be front of mind in that assessment, it would be those key criteria of price, choice and competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Labor senators and other committee members for their goodwill and good faith interaction with the opposition in allaying the various concerns on behalf of AREMA and other stakeholders, including a detailed briefing organised for us with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and in particular the GEMS Regulator team.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, the coalition believes the stated aims of the bill will be met through the amendments which the government is proposing. We welcome the bill as a practical and logical measure to lessen administrative burden, improve response time to industry applicants, align with international product categories and provide for more flexibility in the application of the act. In such ways the bill reinforces the GEMS Regulator's pivotal role in advancing energy efficiency. The coalition is therefore happy to join in supporting the bill, and we commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  While probably not a lot of people go around talking a lot about the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act, we do think of it every time we buy key appliances for our house. It's the legislation that determines those energy-saving labels that are red and yellow with stars on them. They tell you whether it's four star, five star or six star. That's why it's a really important piece of legislation to be updating, which is what the amendments in the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023 that we're discussing today will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GEMS Act 2012 regulates a range of appliances and industrial products—things like televisions, dishwashers, household refrigerators, hot-water heaters, computers and monitors, pool pumps and set-top boxes all the way through to electric motors, close-control air conditioners and even commercial refrigeration. So it's wide-reaching, and it helps all of us make informed choices so we can use more energy-efficient appliances in our homes and our businesses and be better equipped in our industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that it is definitely time to update this GEMS Act and modernise it to make sure that it fits with today's technologies, with today's appliances and with today's energy demands. That means expanding the GEMS Act so that we gather more information and set more minimum performance standards on a broader range of appliances and products so that we meet our climate and energy needs into the future. Key to that is building some flexibility into the GEMS Act so that it is ready for people to make better choices. When I talk about flexibility, what this bill will do is provide suppliers of customised products with flexibility in demonstrating how they comply with the act and with greater flexibility to comply with determinations under the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency has described energy efficiency as the 'first fuel', noting that it provides some of the quickest and most cost-effective CO2 mitigation options while at the same time lowering energy bills and strengthening energy security. So it makes a lot of sense to be really thinking about improving the tools we use to find smart ways to manage demand—not just to use less electricity but to use it when it's cheapest and cleanest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the amendments in this bill, noting that it will have that multiple effect of helping people make better decisions so that, on an individual level, they are operating cheaper and more energy-efficient appliances while, at the same time, lowering their personal footprints or their business's footprint. Along the way the bill will really act as a useful tool to encourage greater development and consideration of how the people who are making these appliances can work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important also to see this in the context of the government's broader energy performance agenda. It is just one tool of many in the pursuit of finding those clever ways to reduce our emissions and to provide cheaper energy for people. Modernising and updating the GEMS Act supports the National Energy Transformation Partnership, which is where, for the first time, there is an agreed national plan between the states, the territories and the Commonwealth to keep the lights on through Australia's massive energy transformation, including by helping to make homes and appliances more energy efficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that came out of the May budget was the investment of around $1.7 billion into our energy-saving plan to make homes, businesses and social housing more energy efficient and to drive down energy costs. In particular, one of those incentives was to help Australians who run their own business to save on their energy costs. There was $310 million for the small-business energy incentive, and that provided to businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50 million an additional 20 per cent deduction on spending that supports electrification and more efficient use of energy. The bonus tax deduction is going to be available for up to $100,000 of total eligible expenditure, with the bonus tax deduction capped at $20,000. And it'll help 3.8 million small and medium sized businesses with ongoing energy savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another step we took was to help small business make every watt count, as we like to say. Around 700 small and medium businesses were offered grants of up to $25,000 to invest in energy performance technology. In my own electorate, two businesses were eligible for this grant. The Sky Rider Motor Inn up in Katoomba was eligible, as was the Closeburn House boutique guesthouse, which is in Mount Victoria. I had a lovely discussion with the operators of Closeburn House about the insulation and additional fabric upgrades they did. For them, it was as simple as reducing some of their energy loss by using much heavier fabrics and curtains. Mount Victoria can be a cold place in the middle of winter, and the operators were very mindful that they could reduce the leakage of their energy by doing something as simple as that and some other insulation upgrades they did. They were given $15,000 to do that. Small amounts of money can make a really big difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to this government continuing to work with community members, whether they're individuals in their own homes or social housing, or they're small businesses, to be able to look at this. The legislation before us is a very practical step in the right direction.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023 is an update to regulations passed back in 2012 after a review. The greenhouse and energy minimum standards scheme is basically designed to create a national standard for energy efficiency in household appliances. There's nothing wrong with that, especially in the context of rapidly rising household energy bills. These particular amendments are extremely minor, and the government have signalled their intent to add more significant amendments later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's all good, all fine, except this scheme doesn't substantively address the biggest drain on household energy: the heating and cooling of our homes. The replacement of household appliances is a small step towards lower emissions as we transition to more renewable clean energy. However, it's nowhere near the scale to meet the crisis. We need much bigger moves. We need to, at the federal level, address the fundamental design of houses, buildings, neighbourhoods and cities. This is about survival, as we face the looming and most dangerous threat of climate change: heat. Heat is the biggest killer of the climate crisis. There are far more deaths from that than from other unnatural disasters brought on by climate change, like floods, fires and cyclones, and Australia is hugely vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the cause of the climate crisis and we know Australia is complicit. We've seen the bushfire and heat maps. We've heard the BOM's predictions and the dire warnings of those in the know, like Greg Mullins, former Commissioner of Fire and Rescue New South Wales and member of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action. I heard from him again last week at a very timely briefing. We are heading into what is likely to be our most challenging summer ever, a summer of unprecedented and extensive heatwaves and potentially catastrophic fires, and every summer thereafter will likely be worse. Greg has risked his life, literally, at the fire front, and he warns that we haven't seen the worst yet. We need urgent and systemic answers to this, and the federal government must play a central role, as this is a national-scale crisis. We need to transition to clean energy now, and part of this is reducing the energy demand of households across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My 40-year career as an architect has taught me that twiddling with appliance specifications is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reducing household energy demand. To really address household energy use, we need to address the spatial and material design of our houses, and there are a number of fundamental principles and minimum standards that every house design must meet if we are to address the scale of this crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An absolutely fundamental principle of residential amenity and energy efficiency is passive solar design. Environmental designers know that houses oriented to north and south can capture winter sunlight and be easily and economically shaded to exclude summer sun, while east and west frontages expose the house to unwanted low, hot summer sun. Houses, townhouses and apartments receiving northern sun in their front or rear gardens or balconies, with natural cross-ventilation, are comfortable and energy-saving living environments. North sloping roofs also allow the maximisation of solar panel harvest. Experienced solar designers know that residential streets should be oriented to primarily run east-west, yet surveyors and planners persist with seemingly random development plans and patterns that make good passive-solar design virtually impossible and thereby lock in high energy use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good solar design is not only useful for comfort, reduced energy use and lower emissions; it also mitigates the worst impacts of the climate catastrophe. Instead, because of the bad design of our neighbourhoods and houses, households that can afford them are running aircon units far more than they should have to. This can be as much as 20 per cent of a household's energy use and result in massive spikes in our energy system during heatwave weeks. Ironically, in addition to driving climate change through the HFCs and burning fossil fuels to power them, aircon units can also raise ambient temperatures surrounding the home by 1.8 Celsius.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't just make our appliances better; we have to change the way we design our homes. As well as good environmental design of individual houses, we must plan our precincts and cities to mitigate climate challenges. We must locate housing judiciously in areas protected from bushfires, above flood levels and secure from coastal erosion and inundations. Hotter seas will likely produce tropical cyclone effects further south in Australia, just as hurricanes are increasing and extending further in the Northern Hemisphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest climate killer in Australia is heatwave effects. We need to design our neighbourhoods to deal with this inevitability, yet we continue to build our cities in ways which create urban heat islands. Heat islands are stationary zones of exceptionally hot air that can persist through the night, with no relief, causing huge stress to the human body. They actually threaten survival and are particularly dangerous for the vulnerable. The hard surfaces of our buildings, roofs, roads, driveways and parking areas absorb heat from the sun and slowly re-radiate it through the night. We know that areas of cities with trees, gardens and permeable soil are significantly cooler, with the shade of leaves and the cooling effect of evapotranspiration significantly reducing temperature. We know we should include generous greenery, a very practical and economical way to shade and cool, but we keep building these air-fryer suburbs. You know the ones—everyone will be familiar with them: black roofs almost touching side to side; front yards dominated by driveways and backyard only a few metres deep; facing windows so close that they're kept closed for privacy, so the air-conditioning has to be cranked harder. This cooling, as I mentioned before, is just a local illusion, as the air-conditioning throws the heat out into the already baking environment. These are literally killer environments in a heating climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the misleadingly named 'greenfield' sites that are to blame for the heat island effect. Poorly designed residential consolidation in what are now called leafy suburbs can destroy valuable established backyard trees and sacrifice permeable water-absorbing gardens to driveways. We can increase density in an environmentally responsibly manner—again, with good design. There are plenty of great international examples of urban housing that's built taller, with a smaller footprint, to allow valuable green courtyards and gardens, the free circulation of cooling breezes and important absorption of water, not to mention pleasant, liveable gardens. An urban network of street trees and backyard gardens serves other important purposes, like providing wildlife corridors and absorption and slowing of the storm run-off that, in our ubiquitous hard paved environments, can actually exacerbate flooding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Saul Griffith's dictum to electrify everything must guide our endeavours to replace gas and solid fuel from our domestic cooking and heating, as it also must guide the replacement of gas and coal at the national level, as the UN says we must right now. Just this morning Saul Griffith, who is actually the Australian architect of the United States Inflation Reduction Act, outlined the massive opportunity for Australia's future if we invest in all aspects of clean energy incentives and stimulus at every layer of the economy—that is, incentives for buyers to purchase EVs, appliances and goods; incentives for producers of clean energy to run those appliances; and incentives for producers and manufacturers of cars, appliances et cetera. This is an emergency, and we have to respond with emergency powers. Sort of like the US arsenal of democracy in World War II, the world needs an arsenal of survival.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In another huge opportunity for Australia, the world needs our resources. Australia is the first, second, third or fourth largest producer of these essential minerals: aluminium, copper, nickel, magnesium, cobalt and lithium. We would be absolutely insane not to capitalise on this. Intelligent design of whole-economy solutions is clearly what we need, and I need to stress this would be an investment, as Saul Griffith said, with potentially enormous returns, not a cost. We know these things, we know what works and we know that good design and planning for the reality of climate challenges from the ground up is far more economical than, especially in the place of housing, retrofitting poor design or the overuse of energy for heating and cooling, which poor design actually locks in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet where are the appropriate controls and provisions in our planning and building codes and mandated design standards? Australia's mass housing patently does not meet even the most basic environmental standards. In fact I would say it's an environmental—and I'd also argue social—disgrace, causing rather than solving problems. Why? Local for-profit developers intimidate and dominate local government, and building property organisations and major builders play state governments off against each other—another example of the dangerous capture of Australian governments by corporate for-profit interests working against the needs and interests of everyday people and communities. We urgently need to build hundreds of thousands of new affordable social and public houses. Like rental reform, this is an issue of national import, way too important and of too large a scale to just leave to local and state governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A comprehensive response to our housing crisis is a remarkable opportunity, at the large scale needed, to design and build exemplar housing, to improve our lives and to create more sustainable cities. Why waste it dithering around the edges? This is an urgent national issue that requires a national-scale solution. We need to develop a comprehensive and cohesive sustainable cities policy and delivery mechanism at this federal level. The measures in this bill are a tiny step towards this, but in terms of the existential scale of the climate crisis they mean virtually nothing while the government keeps approving new coal and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier I mentioned Greg Mullins, former commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and member of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action. Greg Mullins knows the score and knows the risk from experience of climate induced catastrophe, literally from the front line. Greg Mullins just last week called for the immediate cessation of Labor's $65 billion a year in fossil fuel subsidies, as he blasted the incomprehensible coalmine approvals—incomprehensible indeed. The environment minister just approved a coalmine expansion to 2073. That's 50 years from now; long past the supposed net zero year of 2050. That's Labor's fifth coal mine approval this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does love to trot out the excuse that they're just following the law as they're approving these coal mines, 'Nothing to see here,' but do I need to spell it out? You're in government, Labor. You make the laws. In fact, Labor has been in government for over a year and has not just failed to act but has ruled out putting a climate trigger in our environmental laws, the exact thing that would have stopped these approvals. Does Labor care about stopping the climate crisis? For the answer to that, don't listen to what they say; look at what they do. Tragically, what they do is protect the interests of their donors in the fossil fuel industry. So, no, it seems they don't care. It seems they've given up caring about stopping the climate crisis. They'd rather that mining billionaires make a few more billion while our future burns. In the face of the magnitude of the climate crisis, bills like the GEM are an almost meaningless distraction if the bigger picture issues like the housing and climate crises remain unaddressed. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I am proud to be a part of the Albanese Labor government which indeed is acting on climate change. In our first parliamentary sitting week, when we met in this place, we had the opportunity to legislate a 43 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. That was something that we did not have to do, but we chose to do that because we wanted to send a strong signal to the Australian community as well as the business community. We saw investment in low-carbon technologies unlocked, and that's something I'm really proud to see. We've also strengthened the safeguard mechanism to make sure it actually sees a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This Albanese Labor government is a government which continues to be focused on building a better future and providing cost-of-living relief to families as well as creating a sustainable future. This is a task that we embrace with vigour and determination. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I stand here to discuss the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023, also known as the GEMS Act because it is a bit of a gem. This legislation aims to enhance the administration of the GEMS Act. It was an important initiative that was introduced by a previous Labor government. Historically, this is one of the policies that's been incredibly effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I note that we have students watching the chamber duties at the moment. The thing that I want everyone to understand is that this is a government that cares about your future. We want to make sure that we have a liveable planet and that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The initial GEMS Act ensured that we could get more productive output of energy for every bit of energy that we put into an appliance, so this is basically about productivity. Energy efficiency is a really important pathway to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net zero emissions. Often solar panels, wind turbines and wave power are seen as the more glamorous ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the truth is that energy efficiency is an unsung hero. The thing that we're doing today is implementing the recommendations that arose from a 2019 independent review of the act. This review was conducted by Anna Collyer, who now chairs the Australian Energy Market Commission. Her review resulted in 40 recommendations. Some of these recommendations required legislative change, which is why I stand here before you today to discuss this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review was completed in 2019. Labor came into government in 2022. It's really unfortunate that these policy initiatives were not actually implemented. I see this as being consistent with the wasted decade under the coalition government. It's a shame that the previous government sat on these recommendations for such a long time. Is it because the coalition is full of climate deniers? But the truth is that I also know that they are into productivity, so I'm not really sure of the reason for the lack of impetus in getting the job done. Maybe it was lethargy and inaction, but once again, the previous government has cost people money, and that's really unfortunate. It was, unfortunately, a waste of time but also a waste of money for not just households but also small to medium businesses. It's disappointing but not surprising. While the coalition wasted a decade, the Albanese Labor government will not waste a day. We're getting the job done, and that's what's needed to move Australia forward. It's the job necessary to protect consumers and support businesses in meeting their compliance obligations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary objective of the GEMS Act is to establish a national scheme for the labelling of the energy performance of electrical appliances. You might have gone shopping at one of the retail stores like Retravision or Harvey Norman. If you buy a fridge or a washing machine, one of the things that you'll see on that appliance is that it has a star rating. That star rating gives you an understanding of the energy efficiency performance of that product. The thing that's interesting is that, when we buy products, we often think of the capital cost or the initial cost, but we forget to think about how much this is going to cost going forward. That's what an energy-efficiency star rating does: it gives you a good understanding of how much electricity or gas is going into that appliance. You might initially buy a product that seems really cheap, but, when you actually look at the cost of running it over a one- to three-year period, it could be significantly more compared to a more expensive item that might actually be more energy efficient and save you money in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this policy does is give consumers a clear and transparent understanding of the energy consumption of a product. It's smart Labor policy that saves the average Australian household between $140 and $220 on their electricity bill. In addition, the really cool thing about the GEMS Act is that it's estimated to have saved between 4.1 million and 6.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the financial year of 2021-22. This indicates great environmental policy. It's an intelligent way to manage electricity demand. It's smart use at a time when both cost effectiveness and environmental issues are a challenge. Labor is fully aware and understands that the rise in cost of living is putting pressure on Australian households, and we are acting on providing relief to households through electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, cheaper medicines and a rise in wages, and this legislation contributes to that effort. We're making a difference when it comes to electricity bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does not want to let people continue paying more for their energy. That's not productive. Electricity and gas can be wasted through inefficient appliances, poor building maintenance and poor insulation. This is why, once again, it's a Labor government that's taking action. These amendments represent a smart initiative that equips families with the tools and information they need to make informed decisions about their energy use. They can make choices regarding affordable financing, effective appliances and even upgrading their homes and businesses. Empowering consumers to manage their expenses while simultaneously reducing emissions is precisely what these amendments aim to achieve, and that is the goal of this government. We're empowering consumers to make choices about how they spend their money and we're making changes to the regulatory framework to facilitate this process. We're wanting to empower businesses with the flexibility to adapt to the changing conditions and also reduce the costs that come with the necessary measures of compliance. Furthermore, businesses will benefit from reduced compliance costs, a change supported by the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturers Association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The technical amendments proposed in this bill allow customised products to be registered at the point of sale. This allows greater flexibility for businesses and provides for business support and for the regulator to grant exemptions. The bill does this by implementing recommendation 13 of the review by reducing the administrative burden for bespoke products; the bill does this by implementing recommendation 33 of the review by streamlining the application of test standards; the bill does this by reforming the grandfather provisions found at recommendation 33 of this review—the grandfathering provisions provide a transitional exemption where legacy products may be sold under certain circumstances—and the bill also does this by granting powers to the regulator regarding the payment of fees. It's about consumer empowerment, cheaper bills, business flexibility and regulator autonomy. These provisions will directly impact the lives of Australians, putting money back into their pockets and helping businesses thrive and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is yet another testament to a government that takes its responsibilities seriously, a government that is dedicated to significant changes that truly matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are a reflection of our commitment to improving energy efficiency, reducing costs and protecting our environment. And we're not stopping there. This government will continue to review the energy performance standards as part of its national energy performance strategy. It's top of our agenda. Getting the job is our focus; ensuring support and benefits for all Australians, keeping costs down and protecting the environment is our No. 1 priority. It's another step forward in creating a better future for Australia and a better life for all Australians. I commend this amendment to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  The people of North Sydney elected me because they wanted faster action on climate change and, in this context, I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023. For the truth is one of the most important things my community is doing as it takes responsibility for getting itself as close as possible to net zero as quickly as possible is getting all of our electricity from renewable generation and then electrifying everything we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context I welcome the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act, otherwise known as the GEMS Act, which permits the Australian government to set mandatory minimum efficiency requirements for electrical products, further helping to drive greater energy efficiency and excluding the poorest performing products from our market. But while it is a good start, it leaves a long way to go. All the technologies for electrification are commercially available at scale and electrified replacements for gas appliances, including induction cooking, reverse-cycle air conditioning and heat pump hot-water systems are orders of magnitude more efficient than gas and carry additional benefits, chief of which is improved indoor air quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research shows that children living in homes with gas stoves have a 42 per cent increased risk of asthma—that's the equivalent of living with an indoor smoker—but I'm concerned we're not hearing that message. Instead, we're getting bombarded with ads from the gas industry in New South Wales, including offering cash incentives for people who switch from electric to gas appliances. With millions of gas-connected buildings and more climate change fuel disasters reported every day there is no point in prolonging our dependence on this or any other fossil fuel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments improve the flexibility of the scheme's administration as well as easing the compliance burden on industry. This bill actually implements two of the 40 recommendations from the 2019 independent review of the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act conducted by Anna Collyer. I must highlight, however, that two of 40 recommendations in the period of four years is not nearly enough. In the words of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, 'The era of global warming has ended, and the era of global boiling has arrived.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaders must lead. There is simply no more time to delay. That's why I'd like to see more from the GEMS program. I'd like to see more funding so the regulator can do more work. For example, currently there are no efficiency standards for cooktops. There are no efficiency standards for heat pump hot-water systems. These are on the GEMS priority list but, with the new standards taking two to three years to develop, the standards have fallen behind the technology, so consumers are missing out. I acknowledge the government in its recent budget provided $36.7 million over four years to deliver further initiatives, but this pales into insignificance against the $65 billion invested in fossil fuel subsidies. Models run by Rewiring Australia show an overall investment by the government of around $12 billion over the 2020s would finance electrification of all suitable households with electric devices and electric vehicles. Importantly, this investment would also generate cheaper energy bills in the order of $3,000 to $5,000 per household per year in 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spending should be directed through a variety of measures, including grants to low-income households for energy-efficient upgrades and renewable installation. Ultimately if we don't step up our investment in electrification, we will find ourselves the losers in a rapidly accelerating global race for the labour, material and money needed to decarbonise. To make the work of the GEMS regulator more efficient, I'd also like to see more use of international efficiency standards where it makes sense. Reinventing the wheel with local efficiency standards each time in the case where we can borrow from overseas makes no sense. I'd also like to see more focus on reducing greenhouse emissions. With our grid 35 per cent renewable in 2022, it's great to see emissions from electricity dropping rapidly. Emissions from gas, on the other hand, though, are a different story. Consumers can't compare apples with apples, as it currently exists, on efficiency in emissions performance when the stars they see on gas appliances—</span>

Here's a sample of the responses. Murray Irrigation said: 'We're still suffering from the first Labor buybacks.' The National Irrigators' Council said: 'Dairy, rice and grape growers are especially vulnerable.' The Murray region said: 'We're feeling very vulnerable and concerned.' The upper Goulburn said: 'If the minister wants to destroy agricultural production, she's doing a good job.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my Victorian colleagues know, their state, quite sensibly, declined the federal minister's offer to kill off farming in the Victorian Murray-Darling Basin—but not New South Wales. Our local state member, representing the bulk of irrigators, also hates this federal plan, so much so she's planned a protest outside Minister Plibersek's inner-Sydney office this Thursday. Our side of the House supports farming, and we support food production, and we'll try to head off this dreadful legislation in the Senate. But I have some advice to the New South Wales member for Murray: rather than yelling at a minister who won't even be in Sydney this week, stay at Macquarie Street, do what you were elected to do and make the New South Wales government back up their traitorous words with action. Premier Minns and his water minister must join Victoria and categorically rule out allowing these buybacks in their state. I look forward to the state member actively refusing confidence and supply until that happens.</span>

The coup was launched against a democratically elected government and was inspired and driven by the influence of outside parties, who justified their actions within the geopolitical rubric of the time. This justification did not account for the untold suffering which was unleashed on the people of Chile. It's difficult to minimise the sheer cost of what happened in lives and consequences. The disregard for life and intolerance of freedom that were the hallmarks of the Pinochet regime destroyed countless lives and sent thousands of Chileans into exile, including thousands that found refuge here. </span>

Here in the gallery with us today is my friend the ambassador of the Republic of Chile, His Excellency Jaime Chomali; and counsellor Arturo Giadala. They represent a modern, dynamic democracy, which is a key partner of Australia. Today we remember a dark chapter of history but resolve to move forward and never repeat the failures and mistakes of the past. In the words of the Chilean President, I recognise that 'the only way to build a future that is more free and respectful of life and human dignity is to know the whole truth'.</span>

Instead I want to talk about bridges, the infrastructure that connects communities along the length of our greatest river. The old Echuca-Moama Bridge stood in use for 143 years, long after it ceased to meet the needs of communities and regional and interstate freight. A new bridge opened on April 11 last year. The $323 million project was backed by the member for Gippsland as minister and was jointly funded by the New South Wales and Victorian governments. Minister King likes to say in this place, 'You can't drive on a press release,' but the Echuca-Moama Bridge was designed, funded and built by a coalition government, and you can drive on it. I have driven on it. In fact, 10,000 cars a day drive on it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for a similar joint project to replace the Yarrawonga-Mulwala bridge in my electorate. The bridge has some sinkage, a sag in the middle. It's safe, but it's single lane and it's well short of what is needed to take the volume of traffic, including tourists and freight. We built bridges. It's time for the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments to come together and design, fund and build a new bridge across the Murray River between Mulwala and Yarrawonga. The government is 133 days into a 90-day review of infrastructure. You can't drive on that, but you can drive on the Echuca-Moama bridge. </span>

The democratically elected Allende government was ousted by the brutal dictator Pinochet 50 years ago, and that ushered in an era of brutal dictatorship headed by Pinochet. It left a painful chapter in Chilean history, a pain still carried by generations today. Last night I had the honour to attend a memorial mass at St Christopher's Cathedral in the presence of his Excellency the Ambassador of Chile, Mr Jaime Chomali, who is here today in the gallery. In my electorate there is a particular person that I want to make mention of, Juan Garrido-Salgado. He was a survivor of the 1973 coup in July in Chile, and he embodies incredible strength despite enduring life-changing injuries during that period. He now resides in my electorate and serves on the inspiring Pablo Neruda Cultural Committee. He is an active member of the Chilean community in Adelaide. </span>

We stand in solidarity with all those who endured pain, both physical and mental, and today we honour all victims and those tirelessly working to heal their wounds by striving for truth and justice to ensure no repeat of the past. The search for disappeared victims strengthens our historical memory and unity, with still 1,162 people missing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  For over 170 years the people of central-western New South Wales have been fighting for a crossing over the Macquarie River between Mudgee and Orange at Dixons Long Point. For residents of our area it has become known as the Holy Grail of unfinished road projects. A crossing at Dixons Long Point would dramatically cut travel time between Orange and Mudgee, improve connectivity between the Central West and Hunter Valley regions and drive economic growth and tourism. With an impressive cost-benefit ratio, this project makes perfect sense, and I have been fighting for it since the day I was elected to this place. It even featured in my inaugural speech seven years ago. I have personally worked with local Indigenous communities to appropriately address cultural heritage concerns, geotech work had been carried out and we had $27.8 million sitting in the kitty. Unfortunately, the government has now roadblocked it. Sadly, all the government seems to do is try to point-score on the opposition about projects not being sufficiently funded. This is just a cop-out. There isn't a project in the country that didn't experience a rise in costs during the pandemic and the subsequent inflation explosion. That shouldn't be an excuse for snatching away infrastructure money that's already in the bank and dudding the people west of the sandstone curtain. I ask again: what happened to the money? Where is the $27.8 million now, and why can't any of it be used to carry out upgrades to the existing road and crossing? We need answers, not political games. </span>

I was joined by the association's new president, a female for the first time, Nisha Philip, and the secretary, Jos Joy. Congratulations to both of them and their new committee. Also in attendance were other politicians and Krishnan Menon, the secretary of the Federation of the Indian Communities of Queensland.

Out of the legendary and spiritual story of submission and service comes an annual festival of happiness, excitement and joy. It is the sheer vibrance and colour of these events along with boundless enthusiasm that inspire a life of service. The Malayali community contribute to the Ipswich society in many and deep ways across the fields of education, sports, business and health. I know I'm in very safe hands whenever I go to their association events because there are so many doctors, nurses and allied health professionals who serve at Ipswich Hospital and across the community. Congratulations, happy Onam, have a great festival. </span>

Just last month, we heard the startling news that one-third of Australian students failed to meet the proficiency standards for literacy and numeracy required by the NAPLAN test. Surely, as a wealthy and advanced nation, we can do better. Adequate investment in our children's education is crucial—not least, so that every Australian child has the opportunity to reach their full potential, but also as the prosperity of our nation depends upon having a well-educated, thinking population.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was invited by their P&amp;C to visit Narrabeen Sports High School, a school that is just down the road from my office. I was, quite frankly, shocked and saddened by what was shown to me. The school was in a dire state of disrepair and dilapidation. The roofs were leaking. Staircases were rotting. There were holes in the walls. Carpets were cut out because of mould. And science labs had not been working for years. What message does this send to the students and staff? I'm pleased to report that, since my visit and the ensuing media attention, significant works to remedy the situation have been started.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the Gonski review being handed down in 2011, in 2023 public schools are still only being funded to 7.8 per cent below the Schooling Resource Standard. This equates to an annual funding shortfall to our public schools of $1.27 billion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I want to thank the Australian National Veterans Art Museum for sponsoring the event. I also want to thank the Speaker, who came along and announced that we were going to have more art by veterans in our Parliament House art collection. I want to thank the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for the Arts, Tony Burke, for playing the keys as part of the musical set on the night. I thank the Minister for Defence Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Matt Keogh, and also the Assistant Minister for Defence and Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Matt Thistlethwaite, for coming along. I also thank Matt Keogh, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, for singing as part of the band.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event was an important signal that our nearly 600,000-strong veteran community is not defined by the mental or physical scars of their service but by the strength of their skills and by the strength of their character that was shaped through their service. Veterans are not victims—though it's a difficult transition of civilian life, for many. They are the active agents of that transition that does enrich our nation. Many veterans are creatives. Using art to process and transcend their experience, and thus to heal, is incredibly important.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Childhood Dementia Day is 20 September. The campaign this year is called 'FACE it', with the goal of making childhood dementia impossible to ignore. Many people don't realise that there are over 70 genetic disorders that can result in progressive brain damage that leads to childhood dementia. 'FACE it' is part of childhooddementia.org, which is shining a spotlight on this incredibly insidious and rotten disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's impossible to ignore that over 700,000 children and young people worldwide have childhood dementia. The average life expectancy is 28. However, 75 per cent of kids with dementia have a life expectancy of under 18 years of age. That makes the 'FACE it' campaign even more significant. Kids with dementia don't have time on their side. They need a cure. That is why research and ongoing research is critical, along with campaigns like 'FACE it', to create greater awareness. It's giving hope to families who are facing very uncertain and difficult times, with their heart and soul in helping their own children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Last Saturday, I had the absolute privilege of attending the Feng Hua Chinese School Moon Festival celebration. It was a delightful and enriching experience that not only celebrated the rich traditions of Chinese culture but also highlighted the school's remarkable 25-year journey in serving our local community. Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Feng Hua Chinese School was an occasion filled with pride and gratitude. Over the past 25 years, the school has played a pivotal role in Bennelong by providing quality Chinese language education to all and promoting cultural exchange. The moon festival celebrations and traditional Chinese clothing parade, which were part of the anniversary, were shining examples of how the school brings people together to celebrate Chinese culture and heritage. They provide a platform for cultural exchange, foster a sense of belonging and contribute to the cultural vibrancy of Bennelong. This is a lesson that my parents taught me when I was growing up. They were both born overseas. They obviously love Australia and call it home, but they both celebrate their first culture and that of their family with pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon many in our community will come together across Bennelong to celebrate the moon festival. Like many multicultural celebrations, it's one that transcends all communities. Locals in Bennelong now attend Holi, Diwali, the Korean harvest day, Easter, Lunar New Year and the moon festival. In multicultural Australia, we celebrate one another and our cultures. To all Chinese Australians: sheng ri kuai le.</span>

I always remember this day and am forever grateful that my trip to New York, which would've had me staying at the Marriott Hotel, was cancelled just days before. I worked out that I would've been walking through one of the tunnels between the two towers as one of the towers collapsed. It's really poignant to me that, in the rubble of the Marriott Hotel, an Australian flag was found. It was really damaged and torn but still intact. I feel that's a representation of our resilience and the resilience of our good friends of America during that time, and of our forever friendship, having gone through so much together. On that day, 3,000 lives were lost in those towers and in the Pentagon. Ten Australians also died. It is 22 years, but it feels like just yesterday. For the families who lost loved ones in those towers, it will be forever. We must never forget.</span>

Rubys Home Store began when, in 2019, Jane Fonti decided to realise a lifelong dream of owning and operating an online homewares business. A registered and practising nurse of 40 years, Jane has always had a dream for something creative. She was inspired by the Central Coast—the tranquillity of water, sunshine and everything you would typically associate with coastal environments. This love of the coast transfers to her homewares and gift store, where she proudly sells items that she would have in her home. Jane lovingly selects everything in her store and prizes quality over any other principal, which I think is an important priority for any small-business owner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year Jane was the recipient of an Australia Post 2023 Local Business Heroes business package. She received a range of support measures to help her online store thrive. To Jane, her husband, Stephen, her son, Sam, and all the other support networks around her: thank you for making our community strong through small business. Good luck with all of your future endeavours, and thank you for everything that you are doing on the Central Coast, not just in the business community but also in the community more broadly. You are truly bringing us together through those networks.</span>

                  </a>  The money is already there, and it has been there since 2019, when my predecessor, Greg Hunt, got it in the federal budget. It was $228 million to duplicate and electrify the line to Baxter, alleviating pressure at Frankston railway station, creating car parking at Langwarrin and connecting the peninsula to wider bus services. All it needs now is for the state government, the Andrews Labor government, to do its job and to fund its part. At the last state election, our fearless Liberal candidate in Hastings, Briony Hutton, secured a commitment of $746 million from a future coalition government, but the ALP, for their part, promised nothing. Instead of calling up their mates in Spring Street, what have the government done? They have put it on the chopping board, together with two other essential road and safety improvements in my electorate, as part of their 90-day review. Last month I joined Chris Crewther and Renee Heath to protest this outrageous denial.</span>

The 2018 Gartelmann Wines Diedrich Reserve Shiraz took home the award for the best New South Wales wine. The De Iuliis Semillon Single Vineyard took home the award for best current vintage white wine. The big winner, once again, was the 2014 McGuigan Bin 9000 Semillon, which took out the awards for best mature white wine and best semillon.</span>

Once again we celebrate the winemakers who continue to make us proud and who have demonstrated that, when it comes to the world of wine, the Hunter Valley stands as a shining example of perfection. Cheers, and may the wines of the Hunter continue to grace our tables and represent the best of what the mighty Hunter has to offer the world.</span>

I've been informed that many prescribers lack clarity regarding the new 60-day prescribing guidelines as a result of this government's mishandling of its implementation. Also, with medical practice software updates, many systems now default to the 60-day option due to the PBS code starting with a 1. This has led to a surge in incorrect prescriptions due to eligibility requirements, risking the safety of many elderly and sick Australians and placing undue pressures on pharmacists to ensure correct eligibility. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding to this confusion, the Minister for Health and Aged Care's statements on national TV have led the public into believing all medications now are on a 'buy one, get one free' deal, and this has caused an immense amount of anxiety. The elderly are hesitant about stockpiling medicines, and the 60-day dispensing policy risks medication waste and misuse of PBS funds. The policy's poor execution jeopardises the nation's health, potentially leading to medication mismanagement and increased hospitalisations. Labor's 60-day dispensing policy is yet another example of how this incompetent, out-of-touch Labor Albanese government is failing everyday Australians.</span>

The Albanese government is engaging with the Australian community from the ground up. A couple of weeks ago, Minister Giles visited Dayton, in Hasluck, to meet my community to discuss both immigration and the Voice to Parliament. We were hosted by the Swan Valley Labor branch, and I wish to thank Harry Gill and Steve Catania and the team for hosting the forum, and particularly Harry, for providing the translation support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attendees raised a number of issues, ranging from visa and citizenship approvals to health insurance and community support services. Community leaders had noticed the significant improvement in visa-processing times since the election and congratulated the Albanese Labor government. We inherited a crippling backlog of around one million unprocessed visas. Minister Giles added 600 additional processing staff, and by March this year the backlog was almost half of what we inherited, and wait times for temporary and short-term skilled visas had reduced drastically, from around 83 days to around 38 days. The citizenship backlog is also now at its lowest in six years. On the Voice to Parliament, Minister Giles and I were ably assisted by Amar Singh, the 2023 Australian of the Year Local Hero, who stopped in to visit on his long trek around Australia promoting the Voice to Parliament.</span>

Run by Generation Innovation, the GI Challenge unleashes the innovative genius of young entrepreneurs who want to take an idea all the way through to a commercial reality. It does so by clearing away three key challenges that young people face: they lack business experience, a business network, and capital to get their ideas off the ground. For the young entrepreneurs, the GI Challenge is free. That's because of the generosity of sponsors and a team of mentors and subject matter experts who volunteer their time, along with a first-class board of directors ably led by Zoe Sparks and supported by a terrific project manager.</span>

Together, these young entrepreneurs are unleashing their innovative genius, and in doing so they're going to change the world for the better. Good luck.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  After nearly a decade of deliberate wage suppression from the Liberals opposite, the Albanese Labor government is successfully getting wages moving again. The average full-time worker's pay is up 3.9 per cent in the first year of the Albanese government, with the wage price index at its highest level in over a decade. Importantly, the wages of our lowest paid workers are growing fastest at 4.9 per cent, putting more money in the pockets of those who need it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we aren't afraid of strong wages growth. At every opportunity since their return to the opposition benches, the Liberals have desperately tried to stop our efforts to see workers fairly compensated. Without understanding the details of our economic setting, they recycle the same Liberal talking points and ignore the evidence. It's the same old Liberal Party. What more could we expect from the self-proclaimed economic geniuses who deliberately suppressed wages growth for working Australians and left us with $1 trillion of Liberal debt, as well as failing to deliver a single budget surplus in a decade?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, we understand that the divergence between return on capital and return on wages is leaving our economy worse off and that in a competitive marketplace, sensible pay increases will not inflate our economy. Despite their frenzied cries of economic destruction under Labor, it was the Liberals that spent nearly a decade failing to protect our supply chains, sabotaging our sovereign capability, eroding competition and racking up $1 trillion of Liberal debt. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Reports say up to 2,100 people have been killed in the disaster, thousands injured and buildings turned to rubble. There are reports of entire villages being almost entirely destroyed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the member for Calwell, I am the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Morocco, and I took the opportunity this morning to call their ambassador, Her Excellency Wassane Zailachi, to express my condolences and concerns. The ambassador reported a massive, all-out country effort with significant support coming from neighbouring nations to deal with the disaster. I've visited Marrakesh as a tourist in the past. The ambassador says that while there is some damage to the medina—it is, after all, a World Heritage listed site—she was pleased to report that it would be reparable. I understand there is some fairly significant damage to the main mosque. Rescuers are scrambling through the mountains to assist people. The ambassador's words to me were: 'It's like Australia and it's like your bushfires, and we will rise to meet the challenge and overcome these difficulties.' My heart and, I think, the hearts of everybody in this chamber go out to the people of Morocco at the moment, and I wish them well.</span>

Ten Australians were amongst those who lost their lives that day, and today we honour their memory. Our thoughts go to all of their family and friends. Some of course were known to people in this House due to their past professions and relationships, so today will be a difficult day. It's a day as well where the democratic world and all those who uphold human rights and human decency reassert our commitment to continue to fight the scourge of terrorism, to remain vigilant and to make sure that we do so for this and for future generations.</span>

We think of those families, the first responders and others who still live with the loss and in many cases, psychologically if not physically as well, have not recovered from those treacherous events. It's changed the world. It's changed the way in which we travel and we operate. It's changed the world in many ways. All of us can recall those dark scenes as they came across our television screens, and people were watching in disbelief. I pay tribute to all of those in our country and in the United States, with our other allies, who have worked hard day and night—intelligence agencies and security agencies—to keep us safe and to prevent another similar tragedy of that scale from having taken place. It's no small achievement that we live in relative peace in this country, and I hope and pray that it always may be the case. But we should never forget those who sacrificed themselves to keep us in that position. It's something worth honouring as we commemorate the very significant loss that the United States suffered 22 years ago.</span>

Prime Minister, you've completely mishandled your Canberra Voice proposal, and it's increasingly clear that the Voice referendum is not going to deliver the moment of national unity that the 1967 referendum delivered. How can you in good conscience drive the country to a divisive referendum on 14 October? As the writs are yet to be issued, will the Prime Minister withdraw his Voice referendum so that we can avoid an outcome which sets back reconciliation and divides the nation?</span>

I said that we would work through the referendum working group and the constitutional advisory group to develop the legislation that was introduced into this house in March, and then we had a parliamentary committee examine that before June. Before even the March date—last year, the National Party declared their opposition—and before the parliamentary committee process went through, the Liberal Party declared their opposition. But the Leader of the Opposition sat on this side of the chamber and voted for the legislation, as did a majority of senators. They voted for the legislation. Under the legislation, the referendum must be held between two months and 33 days and six months from the passing of that legislation, which was passed in June. I announced, so as to give people more notice than was necessary, the 14 October date. The referendum will take place on that day, and Australians will get to determine their view on that date.</span>

In addition to that, we have our $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, which we announced in June. In addition to that, we've announced a new national target to build 1.2 million homes over five years and the $3 billion New Homes Bonus so that state governments get homes built. In addition to that, with National Cabinet, we've announced a better deal for renters. Today we have committed an additional $1 billion in funding for the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to build more homes for Australians who need them. I thank the crossbenchers in this chamber and in the other chamber for joining with the Labor government to make sure this is done.</span>

This was a decision to change nothing that occurred, and one of the things that I do, as Prime Minister, is not appoint myself to other jobs. I trust my ministers to make decisions.

In 2007, Qatar Airways had seven flights, as a result of a decision by Mark Vaile, the then minister, to the gateway airports, which is where the Airservices agreements came from. In 2009, that went to 14 flights as a result of a decision that I made. So it went from seven to 14. In 2015 it went to 21 flights.</span>

                  </a>  I want to deal with this issue, as I suspected it would come up again today. My role is to interpret the standing orders as they are written.

It does refer to 'a direct answer', as the Leader of the Opposition, I'm sure, would like, but says the answer must be 'directly relevant to the question'.

She knows how important it is that this bill actually pass the parliament. She knows how important it is for every Australian that needs a safe and affordable place to call home. Indeed, passing this bill for the parliament is important for the women and children fleeing family and domestic violence. It is important for older women at risk of homelessness because 4,000 of the 30,000 social and affordable homes that this fund will build in its first five years will be going to those groups, as well as $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important for Indigenous communities that this bill pass the House—$200 million for the repair, maintenance and improvement of their housing will be available in the first five years of the fund. It's also important for the veterans who are experiencing homelessness and who are at risk of homelessness because $30 million will be available to build, house and fund special services for those veterans in the first five years. But it's critically important for the community housing providers who have already done the work to get as many homes on the ground as quickly as they can once this bill passes the parliament. And of course it's important news for future generations who will benefit from having a fund there in perpetuity to build social and affordable homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund is the single biggest investment from a federal government in more than a decade in social and affordable housing in this country. For the first time, the Commonwealth government will have a legislative mandate to finance and support social and affordable housing right across the country. It will be there in perpetuity—not just for this government and not just the first five years of the fund but there in perpetuity, with returns going into social and affordable housing. This will change housing in Australia. It will benefit so many Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have worked tirelessly to deliver this bill because we understand the long-term reform required to turn around the housing challenges that we inherited from those opposite. But this is about people, and I want to thank the members in this place who understand that: the members of the crossbench who have joined us, the member for Bass, even, and of course now the Greens. We are getting this done together because it's important for people on the ground. It has always been about people, the people who are waiting for social and affordable homes across this country. I look forward to seeing this bill pass the parliament; working for all Australians, but particularly those doing it tough; and getting on with the job of delivering more homes for Australians that need them.</span>

Perhaps I'll go into some of the details about how these decisions are made. I've been very clear with the parliament about our government's determination to achieve net zero in Australia. I've made very clear the measures that we're taking: a target of 82 per cent renewable energy and the fact that we are committed to net zero. We've got a trajectory to net zero. But, on the issue of approvals, I think it's very important to say this: the Greens political party knows that emissions from coal and gas projects are covered by the climate minister's safeguard mechanism to make sure that all big polluters reduce their pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that the Greens political party should know about the safeguard mechanism is that they spent weeks negotiating it with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy. They negotiated the safeguard mechanism. They voted for it. They've defended it. They say they believe in the safeguard mechanism as a way of getting Australia to net zero. And yet, having negotiated it, defended it and voted for it, they now think that the climate minister should do something different to what the environment minister does, so you have two separate approval mechanisms, one on climate and energy and one on environment. It simply makes no sense. The Greens political party voted for a law to get emissions down. It's the safeguard mechanism. All new projects are assessed against that safeguard mechanism. That's what you agreed to. That's what you voted for. That's what we're doing. That's what we'll keep doing, because we're committed to getting to net zero.</span>

This is a really important day for housing policy in this country. After months of delay, the Housing Australia Future Fund will now be locked into legislation. This is the biggest investment in social and affordable housing for more than a decade. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing, and I thank the crossbench for getting on board as well so that we can make this progress together. I pay tribute in particular to the housing minister, who, with her characteristic humility, took none of the credit for the substantial amount of work that she does in this area. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just a big win for the government. Much more importantly than that, it is a big win for Australians, who desperately need more homes to be built. This will mean an extra 30,000 homes for people who desperately need them, often the most vulnerable people in our communities. Housing costs are such a big and important part of the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing. To put it bluntly, there are not enough homes, and rents are too high. That's why the government is focused on a broad and ambitious housing agenda and why the passage of the Housing Australia Future Fund is absolutely critical. It sits alongside, as the minister said, our Housing Accord, the Social Housing Accelerator and the biggest increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in three decades—billions of dollars being invested into the housing challenge we have in our economy and in our society, building more homes, more supply, and taking some of the edge off rents, with the Commonwealth rent assistance increase.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another way that we are addressing the serious cost-of-living pressures that people are facing in a way that takes some of the edge off inflation rather than adding to the inflationary pressures that we have in our economy. We understand that people are under pressure. We understand that housing is a big part of that, and that's why today's progress is so important. This is how we work for Australia to build more homes, despite the angry and nasty negativity that we see from those opposite.</span>

The Albanese government has made housing affordability and supply a priority since forming government last year. This approach is, of course, in stark contrast to those opposite who in government and now in opposition continue to show a lack of interest in housing policy. Through the Albanese government's action, we are supporting vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians through our $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, which will deliver thousands of new social homes across Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government took steps last year to unlock over $575 million from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to deliver more social and affordable housing, and this government is making the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years, benefiting more than one million low-income households, including pensioners, families, veterans, jobseekers and students. Now with agreement on the passage of the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation, this fund will unlock extra housing stock that will benefit Australians, particularly women. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that violence against women and children is a leading cause of homelessness in Australia, which is why we've committed through the Housing Australia Future Fund to deliver $100 million over the first five years for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children. In addition to this investment in crisis and transitional housing, the HAFF will also facilitate 4,000 new long-term homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness. These investments from the Housing Australia Future Fund also complement our work to build more emergency accommodation for women and children through our Safe Places program. Our government has delivered already around 270 new emergency accommodation places under the Safe Places program, assisting up to 1,604 women and children. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now with the passage of the HAFF legislation, we will be able to accelerate this investment, providing more crisis accommodation for more women and children and for older women in particular so that they have a place to call home. </span>

And—in exactly the same way that the previous transport minister had before him decisions about whether to increase Qatar Airlines' access under their bilateral agreements—it is the decision of the transport minister. These are very normal decisions that come before transport ministers. As I have said, again, I consulted with relevant colleagues, but the decision was mine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, about 6,000 of our contemporary veterans are at risk of homelessness. On census night, there were about 1,500 Australian veterans who found themselves homeless. Veterans are three times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population. Frankly, that's not good enough. We have an obligation to look after those who have put on our uniform to protect Australia.</span>

This is fundamental for our veteran community. This will be helping those who might be encountering homelessness but also will be improving the wraparound services that will support veterans and families, when they need it, so that they can avoid becoming homeless as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've committed, in the member for Solomon's electorate, to the Scott Palmer centre, which is a service that will support homeless veterans in the Northern Territory. But we need to do more at a national level. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leave no veteran behind</span> report said, 'Doing nothing is just not an option.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Housing Australia Future Fund, though, will be the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing by a federal government in more than a decade. It will enable the $30 million of funding that we will be able to put towards supporting veterans who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are amazing organisations across Australia doing that work now, and they want to be able to do more to support our veterans. I know the RAAF association in Western Australia are moving forward with their program and looking to government as to how they can receive more support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went with the member for Jagajaga, just the other week, to visit the V Centre being built in her electorate and to meet with Vasey RSL Care, to look at the work that they are doing in supporting veterans who need transitional housing. I thank her for having me for that visit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I've been engaging with the member for Solomon and the work that he's doing with the CAV up there in Darwin to support the Scott Palmer centre, working with the Northern Territory, to make sure that we can bring this project to fruition.</span>

Now that the minister has had several days to refresh her memory, can the minister update the House on any discussions with Qantas she had about this matter?</span>

I do routinely meet with the CEOs of all airlines, airports and peak bodies, and, as I said, from my recollection, the main people lobbying my office and me about Qatar were from Virgin and a third party who contacted my office on behalf of Qatar. Again, from my recollection, the discussions I have had with Qantas recently have in the main been about their concerns about our 'closing the labour loophole' legislation. The fact is that I and my office have received more lobbying on behalf of Qatar Airways than we did on behalf of Qantas. It might not suit the narrative of those opposite, but that is what happened.</span>

Last week, we launched the report on our South-East Asia economic strategy to 2040 developed by Nicholas Moore, and I thank Mr Moore for it. We launched it in Jakarta. There were leading businesspeople, including the new head of the Business Council of Australia, there with us in Jakarta. It was appropriate to do that. ASEAN represents two-way trade that was worth over $178 billion last year, 15 per cent of Australia's trade, greater than our trade with either the US or Japan. In the report, we also announced three commitments that we have made: funding to deal with investment deal teams; a South-East Asia business exchange; and two-way placements and an internships program for businesses at both ends. </span>

I thank my friend President Joko Widodo.</span>

We signed and upgraded the relationship to a strategic partnership while I was there. There are more than 250 major Australian companies operating in the Philippines, and that will make an enormous difference. One company, ACEN, is looking at lifting the $2 billion they have invested in solar energy here in Australia to $6 billion over the next three years—just one example of what can be achieved. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia lags behind on consumer protections for air travellers. The US, Canada and the EU all compensate passengers for delays and cancellations. We're a country of migrants. Issues with flights can be the difference between us seeing our family and not seeing them. When will Australia hold its airlines to account for ripping off Australians and improve consumer protections around our aviation industry?</span>

This is a really important issue, and I particularly want to draw your attention to the green paper that I launched last week. It is not good enough at the moment that we have service standards as low as they are. It is not good enough that we have had people who are not able to get refunds for flights that they could not take because of cancellations during COVID. It is not good enough that people with disabilities cannot travel by air as freely as those without disabilities. That is why, in the green paper, I have very deliberately canvassed the issue of consumer protections. While we have the Australian Consumer Law, which provides baseline protections for all consumers when it comes to goods and services they purchase—and that includes goods and services they purchase in aviation—aviation complaints are up. They've been up across the board for some time now. It's why I would really commend the green paper to you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are countries that have different levels of protections when it comes to aviation consumer rights, and, exactly as the green paper states, we are seeking submissions on this very issue. I'm sure that the member for Kooyong will contribute constructively to that green paper process when it comes to consumer protections, as she does so regularly on a range of policy matters, but I do say really clearly: airlines need to do better when it comes to Australian consumers. I have been highly critical of Qantas for some time in relation to a range of issues. They need to do better. All consumers in Australia deserve to have access to a decent aviation service, and that's what we're delivering through the aviation white paper.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He knows that, in order for school students to succeed in the classroom and, ultimately, in our increasingly digital society, they must have access to good, reliable internet. In 2023 connectivity is essential to maximising educational opportunities, from undertaking research for an assignment to participating in virtual learning. That's why the Albanese government is taking practical action to ensure that families with school-age children, regardless of their means or their postcode, are connected and that the cost-of-living pressures don't further worsen digital exclusion. That's where the School Student Broadband Initiative comes: a year of free NBN connectivity for up to 30,000 unconnected families with school-age children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To reach families who may benefit from this initiative, charitable organisations such as YWCA Canberra have been key. The YWCA is one of the nominating charitable agencies supporting families to access this initiative. I was pleased today to visit the YWCA—along with my colleague the Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, Doctor Leigh—and hear about the important work they're doing to support families in the ACT. Charitable organisations have a strong understanding of the needs of local families in balancing cost-of-living pressures, and they have longstanding relationships with families who could benefit from the School Student Broadband Initiative. The CEO of YWCA Canberra, Frances Crimmins, and her great staff told us of the tangible benefits that accessing free broadband is already delivering for families. She described it as a great initiative to address the cost-of-living challenges for many families and life-changing for one family in particular, a single mother and her eight children, who are all set to benefit from this free internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As all members would recognise, Australian charities are vital in building stronger, fairer communities that are better places to live. They provide critical support to vulnerable members of our society, and I thank all of the charities and community organisations who've come on board to support the School Student Broadband Initiative, including YWCA Canberra. I'm pleased to inform the House that today more than 3,000 families without broadband at home are being connected to free internet, and over 20,000 vouchers for free connections have now been issued by NBN to nominating agencies and eligible families. Through this initiative we're delivering real outcomes for Australian students, giving them the tools they need to succeed and prosper in the classroom and beyond.</span>

The question should go to the member for Cook, because he has never been at Kirribilli or the Lodge on my watch, not once. The last time he was there, Scott Morrison was the Prime Minister of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition went on 2GB last week and just asserted this to be a fact. It is a lie. It was a lie from the Leader of the Opposition, and it is typical of what they do. They want to just make anything up. They sided with Qantas when it grounded its fleet in 2011 and locked out its workforce. We stood up for the workforce. They sided with Qantas when its major competitor Virgin collapsed into administration in 2020. They sided with Qantas when it sacked and outsourced thousands of its workforce. They delivered $2.7 billion in taxpayer support, including almost $900 million in JobKeeper, without putting in place any mechanism to get funding back. You ask the question; you get the answer.</span>

This is especially important at a time when people are under substantial cost-of-living pressure. Our plan is all about getting wages moving in a responsible and sustainable way, after a decade of stagnation from those opposite, and in ways that will help people deal with the price pressures in our economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working for Australia and we are delivering for working people. We saw that in new analysis today, the average full-time earnings grew 3.9 per cent over the first year of the Albanese government. This is the fastest rate of growth in a decade, outside of the pandemic. It is much more than the 2.4 per cent average under those opposite. An average full-time worker was $3,700 better off in the first year of the Albanese government. That is $1,400 more than would have been the case if they got the wage increases under the wages stagnation of those opposite. Wage suppression was a deliberate design feature of those opposite. That's why wages stagnated, not by accident but on purpose. It's what they wanted for working people. When the member for Hume was asked about the changes we are making to industrial relations he didn't support them because, 'It would push wages up.' Not for the first time the member for Hume said the quiet bit out loud. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased with the wages growth that we are seeing. It is making a difference, but Australians are still under significant pressure. That's why the primary focus of this government and this Prime Minister is rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief in ways that take the edge of inflation rather than add to it. We are seeing that in child care, medicines, rent assistance and electricity bill relief that those opposite voted against. Those opposite will never understand. They will never understand that when it comes to the pressures that people are under, decent wages growth is part of the solution and not part of the problem.</span>

She refers, quite rightly, to the public data released a few weeks ago, the quarterly projections for greenhouse gas emissions. They did show that emissions were up 0.1 per cent over the year, or about 0.3 per cent of a megaton. There was other data included in that. Electricity emissions were down four per cent, which is a good thing as people take up more and more renewable energy. Fugitive emissions, which the honourable member is interested in, were down one per cent. Stationary energy, mainly industry, was down just under one per cent. Agriculture emissions were up three per cent, reflecting, by and large, a return to predrought conditions, and transport emissions were up six per cent, which really tells us a few things. It tells us that aviation is returning to pre-COVID levels, and it also underlines the need for more action on transport, which is why the transport minister has convened the Jet Zero Council to determine new and better ways for sustainable aviation fuel, and it's why the transport minister and I are working on fuel efficiency standards. All of this very important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member referred to advice and Climate Change Act. As the honourable member knows, the other thing incorporated in the Climate Change Act—which, again, I recognise she supported through the House—is an annual statement by me, the minister of the day, to the parliament on progress, both on how we're going on emissions and on the effectiveness of government policy that must, under law, be supported by independent advice from the Climate Change Authority, which must be tabled at the same time. I have not yet received that advice. When it comes time for the annual statement, it will be tabled in accordance with the law later this year; that is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do recognise, on this side of the House, that 43 per cent is an ambitious target. It's achievable, but it's also ambitious. It won't happen in the absence of government action, and that's why not only are we implementing all the policies we took to the election but we've announced we'll implement sector plans as well, and we have begun the process of setting the 2035 target. Some people spent the weekend debating whether climate change is real, and some people spent the weekend debating about whether they were committed to the bare minimum of action—net zero by 2050. They spent the weekend arguing about whether there's such a thing as climate change. We don't spend our time doing that. We spend our time getting on with implementing policies to reduce emissions. That's what the Albanese government does. It gets on with the job of implementing the mandate that we were elected to implement—reducing emissions, creating jobs of the future, implementing more renewable energy and getting emissions down—and that's the job we'll continue to do with no support from those opposite, who can't agree on whether climate change is real or not.</span>

An essential part of working for Australia is to get more people into work and to make sure they're paid more for it. Almost half a million jobs have been created under the Albanese Labor government, and around 85 per cent of those new jobs have been full-time jobs. From the analysis that's been released from Treasury today, the average increase in pay for a full-time worker is $10 a day. That's what happens when you no longer—</span>

                  </a>  It happens as a result of a government that no longer believes that low wages should be a deliberate design feature of management of the economy. It is $10 a day more because of change of government policy; $10 a day more because of a government with a Prime Minister that was willing to argue for an extra dollar an hour for the lowest-paid in Australia; $10 a day more because of a government that was willing to front up and argue for increased pay for aged-care workers; $10 a day more from a government that was willing to reform the bargaining system, the same reforms that the shadow Treasurer opposed because he knew they would increase wages; $10 a day more from a government that banned pay secrecy clauses—pay secrecy clauses that they defended and voted to retain; $10 a day more from a government that had legislation to ban advertising a job for less than the legal minimum, and they still voted against that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are many workers who this still isn't reaching: workers who it's not reaching because they are in a situation where there are loopholes that their employers are using to make sure they don't even get the minimum standards; workers in the gig economy, where there are no minimum standards at all; workers who work at places where there is an enterprise agreement in place but they don't get the enterprise agreement rate because the relevant employer is using the labour hire loophole to undercut the rate; and workers for employers who are willing to engage in wage theft, which should have been made a crime a long time ago, except they did the extraordinary thing of voting—</span>

I was talking to some of the journos this morning. I note Clare Armstrong has made the effort to come here. She is the only one. Good on you, Clare. We were talking about question time today. But this is not something I anticipated. It might be news to the member for Bradfield that every major business in Australia is supporting the 'yes' campaign. Woolworths, Coles, Telstra, BHP, Rio Tinto, the Business Council of Australia, the Catholic Church, the Imams Council, the Australian Football League, the National Rugby League, Rugby Australia and Netball Australia are all supporting the 'yes' campaign in this referendum. I'll tell you who the VIPs were that day; they were the Indigenous workers, who I was proud to meet. Going back more than a decade—because the point is here that this referendum has been a long time coming; planes were painted with the 'R' for 'recognise' more than a decade ago, just as planes were painted, like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wunala Dreaming</span>, to pay respect to Indigenous Australians a long time ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies are doing this because they understand. They've introduced reconciliation action plans. They have done so much. So many companies are doing good things, employing Indigenous Australians—particularly in regional Australia, it must be said. And that's a good thing. So it should be no surprise whatsoever that, along with a range of other businesses, they are all supporting the 'yes' campaign. Indeed, the Business Council of Australia—Tim Reed, the president, was talking to me at the BCA dinner just a couple of weeks ago about the enormous support, and how there is such support across the business community for 'yes' because they also know it's important for their businesses. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has more than 100 aged-care reform projects on the go at the moment, but perhaps our most important reform was to back those workers—to back the people who were left languishing by those opposite for nine long years. As the Prime Minister says, 'Aged-care workers deserve more than our thanks'—they deserve a pay rise. And that is exactly what we gave them. We invested $11.3 billion to fund a 15 per cent increase above the award for aged-care workers, to help attract and to retain staff. And this pay rise is having an immediate impact. Workers and staff at facilities like Eldercare Seaford, in the Minister for Social Services's electorate of Kingston, have told us that they now see a career in aged care, thanks to this pay rise. And we are hearing from providers that every staff metric has improved since this pay rise was introduced on 1 July. Staff attraction, staff retention and staff satisfaction are all trending upward since 1 July. This shows our commitment to lifting wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the broad impact of our commitment was revealed, with the average full-time worker $3,700 better off than they were one year ago. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data detailed by the Treasurer today shows wages for a full-time worker increased by 3.9 per cent in the first year of the Albanese government. That is the fastest rate of uptick in a decade, because our government cares about a fair day's work and a fair day's pay. Our government cares about getting wages moving again and our government cares about rewarding the skilled, in-demand and tireless workers in sectors like aged care—sectors where, for too long, they were told to just be happy to have a job at all. They were told to be happy to have a job that didn't reward them for the skills and the sophistication of the work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that there are many challenges in aged care, but with great challenge comes great opportunity, and unlike the previous government we are confronting those challenges head on and we are seizing the opportunities that come alongside them.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This <span style="font-style:italic;">Report by statement</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is on the committee's review of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Amendment Rules 2023. The rules were made under subsection 53(2) of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, the FITS Act, and commenced on 1 July 2023. Subsection 53(4) of the FITS Act provides that the committee must review the rules as soon as possible after they are made and report its comments and recommendations at each house of the parliament before the end of the 15-day disallowance period for them. The FITS Act establishes the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, known as the FITS, which seeks to ensure the transparency of activities undertaken in Australia on behalf of foreign principals, particularly where those activities are intended to influence Australian politics or governments on behalf of a foreign government. The FITS does this by requiring registration of relevant foreign influence activities with the Attorney-General's Department and that department's maintenance of a public register of these activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will note that the committee is separately examining the operation and effectiveness of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme as a whole. That is quite a large job and large review, and this review is required by a separate provision of the FITS Act and was commenced by the committee in August 2021. That review is close to completion, and the committee looks forward to presenting its views and recommendations to parliament on how the scheme is working or not working, whatever may be the case, and how it can be strengthened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For now, back to these rules. The committee opened its review of these rules on 26 July 2023. The committee invited public submissions to the review but did not receive any. The committee held a private briefing on 10 August 2023 to discuss the rules with representatives of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The original Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Rules 2018 set out purposes for which and persons to whom information obtained by the Attorney-General's Department under the FITS and not otherwise published may be communicated outside of the department. The 2023 amendment rules authorise a new purpose and entity for the sharing of FITS information. The rules allow the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to communicate scheme information to the minister and department responsible for Australia's Foreign Relations (State and Territory Arrangements) Act 2020, the foreign relations act, for the purposes of administering that act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign relations act establishes the Foreign Arrangements Scheme, the FAS, which requires state and territory entities to notify the Minister for Foreign Affairs of pre-existing and prospective arrangements with foreign entities and provides that the minister may cancel, vary or prevent an arrangement from proceeding if it is inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adversely affects Australia foreign relations. The government advised the committee that a small number of entities may be within the scope of both the FITS and the FAS, the Foreign Arrangements Scheme. For instance, an entity may be a foreign principal or conducting registerable activities under the FITS while also party to an arrangement covered by the foreign relations act. Sharing information under the rules would assist the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to administer the Foreign Arrangements Scheme and would improve the interoperability of the two schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee agrees that streamlining interoperability between the FITS and the FAS is a legitimate and reasonable purpose for sharing FITS information with the minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At the same time, in discussing the rules with the relevant government departments the committee noted that there is no provision under the foreign relations act to allow information sharing in the other direction—that is, for the FAS information to be shared with the administrators of the FITS. Departmental officials advised that they work in practice to share information in both directions and to minimise duplication between the schemes as much as possible. However, a lack of legislative authority for DFAT to share Foreign Arrangements Scheme information is inevitably limiting in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is aware that a review of the Foreign Arrangements Scheme is required to be commissioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2024. The committee believes that such a review should consider the case for amending the foreign relations act to authorise information sharing with the Attorney-General and his department for the purpose of administering the FITS. The committee has also heard in its broader review of the FITS concern from some stakeholders about the compliance burdens created by these schemes, particularly for entities that have or believe they may have obligations under more than one scheme. To this end the committee discussed whether amendments or corrections made to information provided to the FITS may be passed on to DFAT or to other entities with which the Attorney-General's Department has already shared the original information under the FITS rules, rather than making the provider of the information request amendments to multiple schemes. The committee sought assurances from the department that it would seek to make this process as painless as possible for the stakeholders involved while ensuring compliance with the Australian privacy principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the committee is satisfied that the 2023 FITS amendment rules are reasonable and justified. Sharing Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme information with the Foreign Arrangements Scheme where it supports the administration of the latter makes good sense. The committee therefore makes no recommendation for amendment or disallowance of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Amendment Rules 2023. In approving the amendment rules the committee encourages the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their respective departments to make every effort to ensure both schemes operate as seamlessly as possible, including removing duplication and minimising the compliance burden of those who interact with both schemes. I commend this report to the parliament.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I want to make a few brief remarks to put the Greens position on the record, especially given that the position we take today may not necessarily be the position that we'll take in the Senate, and I want to explain why. The Australian Greens welcome the important dialogue that the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 has given impetus to, as with the Migration Arrangement (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2023 before it, which had similar provisions. But, just like with the 2021 bill, this bill will not fix the myriad and systemic problems that have been identified through these important dialogues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are also broadly supportive of the 2019 report of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce and the recommendations it made. The bill before us today is in response to recommendations 19 and 20. Recommendation 19 reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And recommendation 20 reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But sanctions and compliance are only as good as their enforcement—and what is unknown can't be enforced—and this is where the bill fails to live up to the government's rhetoric. The bill relies on the meek and maligned existing assurance protocol, which is an arrangement between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Home Affairs that supports visa holders who've breached a condition due to workplace exploitation. Under the protocol, the department will not usually cancel a visa if the holder has breached a condition. However, this protocol has only been invoked 77 times from 2017 to 2021, because it can only be invoked at the discretion of the Fair Work Ombudsman. Many migrants and their lawyers understandably don't trust the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why any legislation seeking to encourage migrant workers to blow the whistle on exploitative employers needs to have guaranteed protections against visa cancellation. But all this bill provides are speculative and discretionary powers to exploited migrant workers who have been coerced into breaching their visa conditions by exploitative employers. Without guaranteed protection against visa cancellation, unions and legal advocates will have to continue to warn potential migrant worker whistleblowers that, by reporting their exploitation, their visa may be at risk of cancellation. And that's why this bill will fail to live up to the government's hype.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are particularly disappointed that the majority report from the inquiry into this bill by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee didn't make a recommendation to remove these speculative and discretionary powers, given that that was the recommendation of every academic, trade union and legal advocate that provided evidence. Accordingly, the Australian Greens will be supporting this bill's passage and its purported objectives throughout the House today; however, we reserve our position in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I'll start off by saying that exploiting another human being is wrong, and no-one in this place should say or think otherwise. This is the core of this bill. Exploitation thrives on vulnerability and inequality, and it's time that we stand up against it. Every person, no matter where they come from, deserves respect. When we look at migrant workers, we know that one in six recent migrants to Australia is paid less than the minimum wage. That's one in six. Despite working the same job and having the same experience, they get underpaid. There's no doubt about that. They're the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but, when you look at all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act in the 2021-22 year, they make up 26 per cent—over a quarter. So you have to ask yourself: is this the Australia that we aspire to be, a nation that allows a significant portion of its workforce to be exploited, underpaid and denied their basic rights? The answer is unequivocally no. This is not okay. I know that it's not all employers—the majority do the right thing—but, when you see that 26 per cent of all litigation initiated in breaching the Fair Work Act involved migrants, then we know there's something terribly wrong. That's what this bill is all about: fixing that wrong, making sure that people are paid fairly and aren't underpaid, and ensuring that this big number of underpaid people is basically stopped. A nation that allows a significant proportion of its workforce to be exploited, underpaid and denied basic rights—as I said, the answer should be unequivocally no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Adelaide I've met many hardworking individuals who seek nothing more than what they rightly deserve. They don't ask for any special treatment. They seek fairness and dignity alongside their colleagues. It's wrong to exploit vulnerable people who perhaps don't understand the law or are tied to work by a particular type of visa so that they are petrified to speak out. This must stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just the opinion of leaders in the unions. People in other areas have made their position loud and clear. It's basically about what's right and what's wrong. Recently I attended the 2023 regional migration conference, which was held in Adelaide. This issue was raised by migration lawyers, migration agents and other people that are in this space. It's a prime example of how powerful it can be to have people from all different areas in work and life in one room, and many stories were shared that day. One strong point was made clear. It's no secret that there are strong links between migration, globalisation and sustainable development. Migrants have always brought and will continue to bring attributes that have a positive impact on our economy, on the Australian workforce and on the communities they live in. So neglecting the migration system not only hurts migrants but also hurts the Australian workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my experience of being for a number of years on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I understand how important it is for Australians to not only welcome highly skilled migrants but also protect them in our workplaces. We have a duty to do so. It's not acceptable for any worker to endure mistreatment, underpayment or exploitation—we heard about many examples of this when I was on the migration committee—and that standard does not change for those who come to our shores in search of a better future. They should not be denied their rightful share of the prosperity that they actually help create. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Albanese Labor Government is committed to rectifying this injustice, and that is what this bill, at its core, is all about. This bill ensures that we're taking concrete steps to ensure that every worker, regardless of their background or visa status, is treated with dignity and fairness because we believe in a society where the rights of workers should be and are uphill and we believe in a society where exploitation is eradicated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one should stand for deceitful contracting or the unlawful seizure of passports. We heard many stories about people going to perhaps a remote place to pick fruit, to work on a farm or to do other work, where their passports were taken from them. There were many, many accounts of this happening. There have been incidents of harassment and even acts of assault, just to name a few of the things that I've heard in my electorate office and on the migration committee. These accounts are not sporadic occurrences. They represent the daily ordeals faced by numerous temporary visa holders in Australia. Again I say that this is not all employers; the majority are good employers paying the proper wages et cetera. But, when it is 26 per cent of all litigation through the Fair Work Commission, you know there is a problem. That's why this bill is here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Brussels last year, and there was a meeting with the mayor of one of the municipalities who I knew from years ago. We'd had some connection through some international conferences. At the end of the meeting he came up and asked to see me. He was telling me about his daughter who had come out here backpacking and fruit picking and what had happened to her. It was very embarrassing to be there, in front of an international community, with this mayor telling me the story about the tribulations of his daughter, who had her passport taken away by her boss and hadn't known where to turn or what to do. I was hearing this firsthand in Brussels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, these accounts are not sporadic occurrences. This happens on a regular basis, and we must put an end to it. We're resolute to the commitment of putting an end to this unfairness. So this bill is also introducing new criminal offences to hold accountable those who exploit vulnerable individuals based on their migration status within the workplace. This aligns perfectly with recommendation 19 of the report from Professor Allan Fels, which is entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce</span>. In addition, the bill is equipping authorities with new tools to prohibit employers engaging in exploitation practices from hiring workers on temporary visas for a defined period. This corresponds to recommendation 20 from the taskforce, reflecting our determination to shield vulnerable workers from continued exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're recognising the necessity of imposing more substantial penalties for those who engage in these unethical practices. To bolster enforcement, the Australian Border Force will receive new compliance tools, ensuring that employers who exploit workers face the appropriate consequences. Furthermore, steps will be taken to repeal a portion of the Migration Act that inadvertently criminalises workers for breaching their visa conditions. This prevents people from speaking up. It prevents people from going to the authorities. It prevents people from perhaps even joining a union or speaking out. It was an outdated provision. I'm pleased that it's going because it discouraged individuals, as I said, from speaking up about exploitation. So, to rectify this, the bill is instituting safeguards to protect workers who bravely report exploitation from visa cancellations. We've seen it being used continuously. We've seen stories in the media. We heard stories during the migration committee hearings of the threats of cancelling visas or taking away their visas if they didn't comply or spoke out. So the aim is clear. This bill is dedicated to protecting workers' rights and their dignity. I know that by supporting this bill—you'd think everyone in this place would be supporting it—you respect workers' rights. Where their contributions are valued is exploitation becomes a thing of past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill addresses the recommendations made in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Migration Workers' Taskforce</span>, as well as additional measures that will tackle the exploitation of vulnerable workers on temporary visas. It will establish new criminal offences and associated civil penalties to deter employers from using the visa condition or status to coerce, unduly influence or unduly pressure someone in the workplace. It will establish a new mechanism to prohibit an employer from hiring any additional people on temporary visas for a period of time. That one is really important because, if you're doing the wrong thing, you shouldn't have the opportunity to hire anyone else until you're doing the right thing. So that's a good measure in the report and in the bill. We're also increasing the maximum criminal and civil penalties, as I said, for all current and proposed work-related offences and provisions in the Migration Act. We're creating additional tools for the Australian Border Force to address employer compliance and repealing section 235 of the Migration Act, which makes it a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition. We are revising the regulation-making power in the Migration Act to ensure that workers exploitation must be taken into consideration for visa cancellation decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this bill is fairness and equity for all workers, regardless of where you've come from and what sort of work you're doing. It's at the core of our Australian way of life. Every worker should be paid equally with rights and conditions to ensure that no-one is exploited, especially vulnerable workers, people who have come from overseas, whether they're on a temporary visa or some form of bridging visa. We need to ensure that their rights are protected, not only because they are vulnerable and may not know the law but also because it is really important to empower them to speak out when something is being done wrongly to them at their workplace. I commend this bill. I'd like to think that everyone in this place would support it, because at the core of it is equality: equal pay for the same sort of work for any citizen of Australia and anyone who's here for temporary work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  I stand to contribute to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I speak on the subject from experience. Many in this place already know my story. Out of all the lands across the world, my parents decided to make Australia home. This was back in 1976. While I have Goan Indian heritage, my parents grew up in Kenya. My parents migrated to Australia via Africa. When my dad, who is a metalworker, went to the Australian Embassy in Kenya, they said to him, 'You've got the right skills, but you're the wrong colour.' That was, of course, because we still had the White Australia policy in place. When the Gough Whitlam government dismantled the last parts of this policy, that's when my parents decided to come to Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents migrated to Kalgoorlie. My dad came first. He was working at Mount Charlotte. It was a pretty exciting time. He had a wonderful boss. My mum and my sister came later. When they rocked up to Kalgoorlie, dad had heard they were coming, but there was no accommodation for them. The company that dad was working for was supposed to arrange it, but for some reason or another it didn't fall into place. The single men's quarters were exactly that: a place for single men, not a place for families. My dad's anxiety and stress increased. Clearly his performance must have been impacted at work. Bob, dad's boss, said: 'Joe, what's the matter? Why are you worried?' Dad explained that there was no accommodation for his wife and daughter. Luckily, Bob stepped in where the employer did not and provided accommodation for my mum and sister. It's hard to know whether this was a deliberate attempt from the employer or whether it was an oversight. But one of the things that we have seen in Australia is systematic exploitation of migrant workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Albanese Labor government wants to ensure that we look at the structures that are in place and make sure that we make them fairer for all people, including new migrants who come to Australia. The truth is that this country has been built on the back of migrants. There's amazing work that has been achieved through the use of migrant workers. We want them to continue to contribute to Australia. This is the reason why we're looking at this bill. Once again, we are at a time in our economy when businesses are screaming out for skilled migrants to help plug skills gaps. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, often what we see for many migrant workers in our country is that the fair workplaces of Australia are not their lived experience. I know about a Sydney childcare centre operator who failed to pay two employees, under the premise of it being a volunteer arrangement. They were fined $30,000 in penalties and were ordered to provide backpay. I also know about a major waste company that was charged with allegedly underpaying five vulnerable migrant workers a combined total of $190,000. In my home town of Perth, I know of a disability service provider that was fined and ordered to pay back six migrant workers from India and Ireland that it had systematically underpaid for a five-year period. These are not isolated cases. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grattan Institute report in May this year explained that exploitation, underpaying and unscrupulous treatment of migrant workers by employers is widespread. It reported that recent migrants to Australia are twice as likely as long-term residents to be underpaid, and up to 16 per cent of recent migrants are paid less than the national average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Migrant workers are more vulnerable than other workers. Why is this? The office of the commissioner of human rights explains that migrants are at heightened risk of exploitation and abuse in the workplace because of vulnerabilities unique to their temporary visa status. This can include a number of different things, such as deceptive recruitment practices by employers, a lack of social supports and systems and connections to the community to understand what the norms are. Sometimes there are cultural and language barriers, and often there's a lack of awareness of their work and legal rights and also a limit of access to those services. There is also this fundamental power imbalance. The fact that they're dependent on their employer for their visa status makes it a really challenging work environment. There's often a reliance by family members on migrant workers to send money back to their homes by remittance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current penalties on employers for exploiting these vulnerabilities are, frankly, soft. The Grattan Institute argues that they are not at all a deterrent. It compares the $4 million worth of penalties handed out to unscrupulous employers of migrant workers in 2022 with the $3 billion in fines issued by the Australian tax office to people who have not paid their taxes. This soft approach to worker exploitation is, frankly, unacceptable. People need to be put first. This is why we need to pay this crisis the attention it deserves and make the legislative changes that are needed to put an end to exploitation. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill does exactly that. I commend Minister Tony Burke, Minister Clare O'Neil and Minister Andrew Giles for their collaboration in bringing forward this bill. I acknowledge the work they have done in engaging with civil organisations, unions and industries to develop legislation to alleviate the crisis of exploitation and to implement measures that will strengthen the compliance of employers to the fair and just treatment of migrant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations in the bill have the support of the Grattan Institute, which has called for these reforms through its advocacy work to the government and to industry. I commend them for their work in this space and their dedication to improving the treatment of migrant workers in Australia. This bill will strengthen the compliance of employers with regulations that seek to protect vulnerable workers. The Fair Work Act and the Migration Act will work hand in hand to penalise employers who do not comply with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses the discrepancy and implements recommendations that were included in the 2019 report by the Migrant Workers Taskforce. They are recommendations to the former Liberal government which were accepted in principle but failed to be implemented. It's another example of the coalition not following through with action, doing the review but not following up with legislative change. It is a continued theme of the wasted decade under the coalition government, and I don't think it's because the coalition government was pro exploitation. I don't think that's the case. The truth is I don't know the precise reason for their failure, but the thing I can say about the 47th Parliament is that it is the most multicultural parliament we've ever had in Australia. This means that we have more people from diverse backgrounds making decisions and we're thinking about the impacts of these policies to make sure that we actually see what Australia looks like today, but also how we want it to exist in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This crisis of exploitation of the rights of migrant workers that was caused by the 10 years of neglect by the Liberal government was a continued theme, but thanks to this Labor government it will now be a criminal offence for someone to unduly influence, pressure or coerce a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa. Thanks to this Labor government, employers who have been convicted of underpaying temporary migrants will be prevented from employing new temporary visa holders for a period determined by the court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has also thought carefully about how these measures will be enforced. In order to ensure the Australian Border Force is properly resourced, $50 million will be allocated over the next four years to enhance its role in employer compliance. The Grattan Institute reports that migrant workers know that they're underpaid but they don't act. Under amendments to the legislation made by this bill, migrants should have no fear in acting against their employers who are underpaying them. This bill will go further to introduce additional measures to tackle the exploitation by employers of workers on temporary visas. The removal of the section in the Migration Act that makes it a criminal offence to breach a work-related visa condition means that workers will not need to fear criminal sanctions for speaking up against a work related condition of their visa when that condition is a product of an exploitative work environment. This is a big step towards making sure that some of the most vulnerable workers in our country—migrants and temporary visa holders—are supported in speaking out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the pandemic, migrants accounted for a growing share of Australia's workforce. The exploitation of this section of the workforce doesn't only affect them; it hurts all workers by driving down wages and worsening employment conditions for everyone. When the most vulnerable parts of our community are strong, all of Australia is strong. People come to Australia because they believe in this fundamental principle of a fair go, and that's essentially at the heart of this bill. It's about fairness and equity, and that's something that the Albanese Labor government believes in. Not only do we believe in it, but we are prepared to act on it by strengthening these laws to ensure that migrant workers are not exploited. I think this is a wonderful bill that the migrant community will welcome. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  I rise to speak on this important bill about preventing the exploitation of migrant workers. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill is part of the Albanese government's package of reforms to tackle the exploitation of workers. It implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report. I want to commend the Minister for Workplace Relations, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Home Affairs, and the hardworking public servants in their departments, for their work in bringing this bill together. After a decade of neglect, the Albanese Labor government is cleaning up the former coalition government's mess. This bill responds to a report that was handed down in 2019. It took the former government two years to introduce a bill, and then the bill was not even brought on for debate, let alone put to a vote. We saw that happen so much in the last parliament. This sums up the former government's attitude to tackling exploitation. It's another example of those opposite sitting on their hands and looking the other way as a crisis worsens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is obvious that only Labor governments will stand up for workers facing exploitation—workers like Ramadan, who came to Australia in 2018 and worked in a restaurant. His boss promised that he would be sponsored to get a permanent visa in Australia. He was paid in cash, and amounts were deducted for accommodation and 'visa fees'. What money was left Ramadan sent overseas to his wife and daughters. When the restaurant went through a quiet period in January 2019, Ramadan's boss stopped paying him. Ramadan's questions about his unpaid wages were met with his boss telling him that if he wanted a visa he should keep quiet. Months passed, and Ramadan's family kept asking for money. He asked his boss again. His boss said that the business could not pay him and he was going to close. Ramadan asked about his visa and was told that it was with the department of immigration. He contacted the department and found out that no application had ever been lodged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of an exploited worker, as reported by the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Guardian</span>, is a person who goes by the pseudonym Esther. Esther came to Australia to study business and was also a qualified chef. Using her qualification she found work quickly, working in a Korean restaurant in Sydney to support herself through her studies. Her student visa mandated that she work no more than 40 hours a fortnight, but her boss forced her to work more than 40 hours and threatened to sack her if she did not comply. Esther's boss also told her that if she left she would not be able to get any other job, as he would tell other employers not to hire her. The award that Esther was working under mandated a minimum pay of $23.64 an hour; however, she was only paid $15 an hour. She had no ability to raise these issues with anyone, under the threat of losing her job, not finding other employment and being reported for working more than her visa allowed. The article reports:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">She said working conditions were oppressive: staff were shouted at and abused, told they were hopeless and constantly threatened they would be dismissed for "working too slowly".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Esther said she and other workers were abused regularly and kept in a climate of fear. Esther said that she and her colleagues were worked like slaves, were always hurried and weren't given any time to eat lunch or dinner or even go to the toilet. Esther was kept in a constant state of fear and tiredness from being overworked without adequate breaks. She said that these conditions caused her to stop eating. She lost significant amounts of weight and couldn't sleep from the stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is that of Joe, whose story was also reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>. He was regularly exploited in a series of jobs across Sydney and was sacked when he spoke up. Joe notes that exploited workers were 'controlled from the minute they arrive in Australia'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Agents are closely connected with the exploiters themselves, and everything is organised, right from the beginning. When people arrive at the airport there is somebody there to take them … to accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe describes the accommodation as like a slave camp, with seven or eight workers crammed into a room to sleep. He describes being woken up very early in the morning and driven to a building site to work. He said that he felt confused about where he was and who he was working for:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are like forced labour camps, it is like slave labour, these people aren't free at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the article, Joe said that in some cases migrant workers have their passports taken from them:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are not given employment contracts, and there is no agreement on conditions or rates of pay. They face exorbitant deductions from the money that they are paid for rent, food, or other expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe also spoke about other workers:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… particularly students studying in Australia, find jobs through the Korean local media, where jobs are advertised in Korean without any reference to award rates, or conditions. Some openly advertise pay rates as low as $12 an hour … workers are often kept in bleak conditions, crowded into already-overfull houses, especially in the Sydney suburbs of Strathfield and Lidcombe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe said that these rooms are so small, exploited workers cannot even stretch their legs: 'Animals should not be kept like this, let alone people.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will implement reforms to ensure that workers are treated better than this. Part 1 of the bill amends the Migration Act to add new criminal and civil offences concerning coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions or using their visa status to exploit workers. The penalty will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. This is an important deterrent to employers who think about exploiting workers due to visa conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of the bill amends the Migration Act to prohibit employers and individuals from hiring future workers on temporary visas. New prohibition notices will enable the minister to declare employers and individuals to be prohibited from hiring new workers on temporary visas for a period of time. Employers and individuals will be subject to these discretionary prohibition notices when they are found to have breached migration and employment law. Triggers for prohibition will include court orders and noncompliance with employment and migration law. This is an important step in protecting workers, filling the gap in legislation so that employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act can be prevented from hiring more international students or backpackers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 3 of the bill amends the Migration Act to increase penalties for work related breaches to align with the maximum penalties available under the Migration Act. Specifically, the penalties will increase from 60 units to 240 units.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 4 of the bill amends the Migration Act to introduce enforceable undertakings for work related breaches. The Fair Work Ombudsman already successfully uses enforceable undertakings as a tool to promote compliance with the Fair Work Act in other areas. This amendment will ensure that migrant workers can also be protected by this tool, and this reform will be implemented by the Australian Border Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 5 of the bill amends the act to make work related offences and provisions subject to compliance notices. A compliance notice is a formal notice to employers who breach relevant Migration Act and migration regulation rules. Compliance notices are already successfully used to promote compliance with the Fair Work Act and will work to protect migrant workers as well. This reform will also be implemented by the Australian Border Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 6 of the bill will amend the act to allow exploitation of a worker to be considered as a potential mitigating factor when a visa cancellation is under consideration. This will send an important message to migrants on temporary visas who are worried to speak up—that their visa will not be cancelled if they are being exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is supported by many groups, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Migrant Justice Institute, the Human Rights Law Centre and the Grattan Institute, as well as by the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, the peak body for the horticultural sector, a sector which employs thousands of migrant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill adds to the Albanese government's broad reform agenda to the migration and visa system—reforms such as this government slashing the visa backlog that we inherited from our predecessors. Less than 600,000 visa applications are currently being processed, down from just under a million when we came to government, after we invested in our Public Service by adding 500 more staff to address this backlog. Temporary skill shortage visas for health and education workers are being assessed and finalised in days, rather than the months it took under those opposite. We increased the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold to $70,000—the first increase since the last Labor Government in 2013. Finally, we have abolished the AAT, after those opposite politicised the institution. These reforms have allowed for more skilled migrants to come to Australia and increase our economic productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, and our wider reforms, are making our economy fairer and reducing the amount of exploitation in the workforce, because it is only fair that people who come as temporary migrants be treated with the same respect and rights as other workers in our economy. I am so proud to be a part of a government that takes this issue seriously and that hasn't sat around for three years without even introducing a bill into parliament but has responded with urgency to this, because these people matter. We want people to see Australia as a welcoming place and a place where people are treated fairly, as, after all, most Australians pride ourselves on our nation being the place of the fair go. So this bill is putting into practice a little bit of that, ensuring that temporary migrant workers are not exploited, as in some of those terrible examples that I talked about. I'm very proud that our government is tackling this issue head on and improving the conditions for migrant workers.</span>

I want to thank her for her advocacy on this. She cares very deeply about fairness and seeing that people are properly remunerated and are not exploited, and I join her in that worthy cause. As the member for Canberra mentioned, we are the nation of the fair go, but it does not just happen by itself. You've got to act. You've got to show leadership, in order to bring about the conditions by which fairness reigns.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost a decade, we saw a situation where not enough was done in this sector, in this area of concern, and, unfortunately, exploitation was allowed to take hold in different parts of our economy. That is a shame, but what is done is done. We are getting on with the job, because it is up to us, as the federal government now, to fix a lot of the loopholes and to reform acts of parliament that will tackle this issue of exploitation of workers in our nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, one in six recent migrants to Australia is paid less than the minimum wage, and of course this exploitation doesn't just hurt the individual worker but effectively drives down wages and worsens conditions and pay for all Australian workers. That's why it should matter not just because of the humanity of making sure that we look after people in accordance with the law but so that we make sure that we have a fair and just society. We see exploitation all around us, and we are committed to addressing it. </span>

There are new criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace, and that is recommendation 19. There is a new tool to prohibit employers engaging in exploitative practices from being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time, and that is recommendation 20 from the task force. The bill will go further. There will be higher penalties for those who do the wrong thing. The ABF will receive new compliance tools. We will repeal that part of the Migration Act that that was effectively criminalising workers for speaking up and we will encourage workers to speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one part of our government's plan to protect workers. In the 2023-24 budget our government provided $50 million to the Australian Border Force over four years. The ABF oversaw a month of action in July, targeting those employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing. For the first time in a long time the government is raising awareness of employer obligations and getting out and visiting businesses in a substantive way. This work would not have been possible without the increase in funding in the previous budget and the prioritisation this government places on tackling worker exploitation. In addition, the government has been engaged in an intensive co-design process with industry, the union movement and civil society to help inform the design of further safeguards in the visa system. We want to make it is safe for people to speak up when they are being exploited in the workplace. We are exploring a potential new visa for workplace justice as well as ways to make sure people can feel confident that their visa won't be cancelled for speaking up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through consultation we know there are gaps in what workers understand as well as what some employers understand. We know many people don't know where to go if something is wrong. It is not good enough that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experience and who work in the same job, according to a Grattan Institute report. It is also not good enough that one in six recent migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. In fact, it is shameful. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but in the year 2021-22 they made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a migration system that works for everyone. Under paragraph 245AAA of the Migration Act, new criminal and civil offences are being introduced concerning coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions or using their visa status to exploit those workers. The penalty will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. That is an important deterrent to employers who think about exploiting workers due to their visa conditions, and we all know that it is happening. Under paragraph 245AYA of the Migration Act, new prohibition notices will enable the minister or a delegate of the minister to declare employers and individuals to be prohibited from hiring new workers on temporary visas for that period of time. Employers and individuals will be subject to these discretionary prohibition notices when they are found to have breached migration and employment law. Triggers for prohibition will include court orders and non-compliance with employment and migration law, and, where employers and individuals are subject to prohibition notices, the minister must publish the relevant details on the department's website. This is an important step, an accountability step, as there is currently no ability to prevent employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act from hiring international students or backpackers, despite the vulnerability that we all know these workers face. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalties are increasing for work based breaches, to align with the maximum penalties available under the Migration Act. This will see penalties increase from 60 units to 240 units, a substantial increase. This will send an important deterrence message. From paragraph 245ALA of the Migration Act, work related offences and provisions are being made subject to enforceable undertakings. An enforceable undertaking is a written agreement between an entity or person and the government. The Fair Work Ombudsman successfully uses enforceable undertakings as a tool to promote compliance with the Fair Work Act—that is, with the law. This amendment will seek to use similar provisions under the Migration Act by the Australian Border Force. This will provide the ABF with additional tools in their enforcement approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From paragraph 245AYP of the Migration Act, work related offences and provisions are also being made subject to compliance notices. So it is enforceable actions and compliance notices. A compliance notice, of course, is a formal notice to employers who breach relevant Migration Act and Migration Regulations rules. This will provide the ABF with additional tools in their enforcement approach as well. Under section 116(1A) of the Migration Act, the exploitation of a worker will be able to be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. This will send an important message to migrants on temporary visas who are worried to speak up that their visa will not be cancelled if they are being exploited.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Work conditions can't be a race to the bottom. That's why the government has introduced this bill into parliament to help workers speak up and target employers who do the wrong thing. There is a crisis of exploitation at the moment, with up to one in six recent migrants paid less than the minimum wage—as I mentioned before, but I think it's worth mentioning again. It is a shocking statistic. When migrant workers are being underpaid, it hurts all of us, driving wages and conditions down.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade those opposite, the former coalition government, put the safety of migrant workers on the backburner. These reforms will help workers speak up and target those employers who do the wrong thing. Over the last 10 years, our migration system has drifted deeper and deeper into a reliance on low-paid temporary migrant workers, who we know are routinely exploited, under a government that simultaneously did nothing to prevent this exploitation. This indifference stops with our government. That's leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in consultation on systemic changes to our migration system which will ensure it works in the best interests of Australian workers and businesses. We are also doing the necessary work to ensure that no-one who comes to this country is exploited or abused. The fact that this has been happening almost unchecked in our migration system in recent times is a reflection on the competency and values of the former government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exploiting workers is never acceptable. We are committed to stamping it out wherever it's happening and protecting all workers working in Australia, regardless of their migration status. After that decade of neglect, our government is cleaning up the mess of those opposite. Despite the national debate in the wake of the 7-Eleven scandal, the former coalition government, those opposite, sat on their hands. The former Liberal government failed to implement key recommendations from the Migrant Workers Taskforce, which reported to the Morrison government in 2019. Two years later a bill was introduced, but, as was so common with that government in particular, the bill was never even put forward for debate, let alone put to a vote or pushed into the Senate. That is another example, if anyone needed any, about the attitude of the former government to tackling exploitation. They preferred temporary visas to permanent visas, making it easier for unscrupulous employers to target vulnerable workers, when what we all want to see in this country is for some permanent migration that is skilled to come in and help us build our wonderful nation. We certainly don't want to see people exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a massive backlog created, as my friend the member for Canberra articulated well, of almost one million visa applications. Those opposite neglected basic administrative tasks by looking the other way, and, as a chief of the army once said, if you're looking the other way, that's not leadership. The previous government neglected workers by failing to act, and we are fixing that. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  We had a citizenship ceremony in parliament this morning, and it was a wonderful thing to see citizens swearing their allegiance and being part of this country in a permanent way. I'll be attending a number of citizenship ceremonies on the weekend in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. I regret to say that it's probably a reasonable assumption that, among the group of people I will see sworn in, there's a strong chance that at some point in their journey, or their family's journey, in migrating to Australia, they have suffered exploitation at the hands of a worker, because the statistics of the exploitation of migrant workers are quite frightening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experience and who work the same job. We also know that up to one in six recent migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. I thank organisations and researchers, like the Grattan Institute, for looking into this and helping to put more data around a very grey area. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but, in 2021-22, they made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act, and that's data from under the Fair Work Act. That's government data that tells us that. That's why the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 is so important. It's important for anyone who has chosen to come to Australia and work, whether they're a backpacker or an international student, or they're on a working visa, because those people are way more likely to be exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's certainly not to say that every employer is doing the wrong thing. We know they're not. I was a sponsor of an overseas worker some 20 years ago, with whom I still have a very good working relationship. There are so many employers who will do the right thing. I know, in my electorate, when employers ring me and say, 'We're hoping to be able to get this person's visa so they can come and work here'—or get it extended, and all those things—it's because they genuinely value that worker. But, sadly, the data shows that it's not just the odd case of exploitation. There has been widespread exploitation, and some sectors are much worse than others. I think many of us will recall hearing stories in this place in recent years from workers who had been on farms picking fruit. In the agricultural sector, there have certainly been stories that have been shared with all of us. But, as I say, it is widespread.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes me really angry about that sort of exploitation is obviously the effect on that person. It is an appalling thing to happen. It also undercuts all the businesses who are doing the right thing. It makes an uneven playing field, and it not just hurts individual workers but also drives down wages, worsens conditions for all workers and creates a very uneven playing field for businesses. We are committed to addressing this inequity, and this bill implements the key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels' Migrant Workers' Taskforce report. It introduces new criminal offences if a person has their migration status exploited in the workplace. That's recommendation 19 from the task force. There's also action on recommendation 20 with a new tool to prohibit employers engaging in exploitative practices from hiring workers on temporary visas for a period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will go even further. There will be higher penalties for those who do the wrong thing. Importantly, the Australian Border Force is receiving new compliance tools because it has a key role in enforcing this. We'll repeal a part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions, which effectively criminalises speaking up. We don't want that to happen. We want workers to be able to speak about what occurs, and we'll promote workers so that they can speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellation, because they live in fear. They live in fear that the dream that they had of coming to Australia will end because an employer is doing the wrong thing by them. Their desire to be here is so strong that they will often put up with really appalling situations.</span>

We know we don't have all the answers, and we have a commitment to working with those involved to make sure that it's safe for people to speak up when they are experiencing exploitation or when they're witnessing exploitation. We're exploring a potential new visa for workplace justice as well as ways to make sure people can feel confident their visa won't be cancelled. We know there are gaps in what workers understand as well as in what some employers understand, and we know many people don't know where to go if something does go wrong. These are many of the things that we will work on—some of them in this bill and some going forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to speak in detail about a couple of the measures in this bill. On the role of the ABF, you have to be able to go into workplaces and have people trained and skilled to investigate these matters. We have determined that the Australian Border Force is the lead agency for this. They will be out there enforcing the law when it comes to employers who choose to do the wrong thing. For too long the consequences have really just been a slap on the wrist. The chances of getting caught have been very, very small, and that really goes to the situation that we inherited when we came to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government, it was essentially an area of deep neglect. As with many other things, we are trying to clean up a mess that we were left. The former Liberal government oversaw a crisis of exploitation and did very little about it despite the national debate in the wake of the 7-Eleven scandal, where we learnt what was happening in that franchise group. In spite of all the evidence being laid out, the former Liberal government did nothing. They sat on their hands and failed to implement the key recommendations from the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, which reported to the Morrison government in 2019. It's not like they ran out of time to do something; they simply chose not to. Two years later, a bill was introduced, but it was never even put forward for debate, let alone put to a vote or pushed to the Senate. It was just, 'We'll pretend we're doing something,' and that sums up the former government's attitude to tackling exploitation. They also prefer temporary visas to permanent visas, which makes it easier for unscrupulous employers to target these vulnerable workers. We were also left with a backlog of a million visa applications, and that is symptomatic of the sort of neglect that was shown. That's why the role of Border Force in enforcing this is really key.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other measure that I want to refer to is the prohibition measure. The taskforce report recommended exploring ways to exclude employers from employing more workers who hold a temporary visa, for a specific period of time, where the employer has been convicted by a court of underpaying migrants. It seems a pretty reasonable thing to do, and that's why we are doing it. The new prohibition measure will prevent employers and other third parties from hiring any temporary visa holders where they have a conviction for exploiting workers. At the moment, the only bar under the Migration Act on hiring is for sponsored workers, such as those who hold a temporary skills shortage visa, but the new measure will prevent prohibited employers from hiring non-sponsored workers who hold any form of temporary visa, including international students. If I were a parent wanting to see my child study in Australia, I would hope there were protections that would save them from rampant exploitation. The prohibition will be in place for a specific period of time, and, importantly, a list of prohibited employers will be published on the Home Affairs website. These are some of the practical, sensible, reasonable measures in this bill, and they will make it better for workers coming from other countries on temporary visas or as international students or backpackers to be treated with respect and dignity, which is what every single worker deserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will know that this legislation and the other package of measures that we're taking are effective when we see an end to the fear: an end to the fear of workers, in this case migrant workers, speaking out about what they have experienced; an end to the shame that is attached to it; and an end to the anxiety and sense of dread that they have when they're in a situation where their work is not being respected. As the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs says, work conditions can't be a race to the bottom. When migrant workers are underpaid, it hurts all of us. These reforms will help workers speak up and target those employers who do the wrong thing, and I'm very proud that it is an Albanese Labor government that is making these important changes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I am proud to stand today and speak in favour of this bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I'd like to be clear from the outset that migrant worker exploitation in this country is a crisis, and it's completely unacceptable. We heard the member for Macquarie go through the most recent statistics about exploitation of migrant workers, and I thank her for bringing those statistics to the attention of this House. One in six recent migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. You don't have to stretch the imagination too hard to grasp how difficult that would be for people who uproot their entire lives and come from all sorts of circumstances for the chance of a new life in Australia only to be ripped off by their employer. We know that the consequences of exploitation mean being forced back to work, to work gruelling hours, or to put up with other forms of unacceptable workplace conduct, like bullying or even being injured at work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exploitation of migrant workers affects us all. It harms communities and it undermines employees' ability to bargain. In fact, as the Director of Labour Market Enforcement in the UK recently stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Exploitation of workers is not just an offence against the individual—which is serious enough. It also undermines the competitiveness of compliant businesses who treat their workers fairly and with consideration. Worker exploitation can also have a destabilising impact on whole communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exploitation does not happen necessarily behind closed doors. It does not happen quietly or by accident. It's happening to workers that we interact with every day, commonly in hospitality or accommodation services, but even more broadly, in my experience, in areas like aged care, in health facilities and even in manufacturing. And I want to especially highlight that it was people on visas who were delivering essential services during the pandemic—stacking shelves, caring for the vulnerable, staffing our hospitals. But they're scared to speak out when they're unpaid, underpaid or mistreated and this has to end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, due to a decade of inaction and ineptitude by the coalition government, this kind of practice has become commonplace. You could almost call the exploitation of migrant workers the Liberal-National business model.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years later a bill was introduced, but, as is so common with the former government, it was never even put forward to debate, let alone put to a vote or even tabled in the Senate. We shouldn't be surprised. They used to call a press conference. They would appoint an expert. They would say some big words. And then they would let an important report gather dust. I'm sure they were very busy when they were ignoring the task force's recommendations and not bringing the bill on for a debate, but they did create a backlog of almost one million visa applications. They neglected basic administrative tasks. And they turned a blind eye. But now we are going to act. It's critical that we do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, Professor Allan Fels, said recently: 'This exploitation has been a severe problem for at least 10 years. There have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it. Now it is extremely timely because of the expected increase in migration.' As the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs said, 'There is a crisis of exploitation in Australian workplaces.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent much of my life standing up for the rights of workers right across this country. As federal secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Association and for a decade as president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions I saw time and time again exploitation of workers under the coalition government that was absolutely unacceptable. Let me tell you a little bit about what I saw. I saw exploitation of aged-care workers, where they came into this country on temporary visas, were promised that if they did training courses with the provider they would be registered as RNs. Apart from that bit being absolutely untrue, they were told if they worked three-month internships unpaid that they would then get their certificate and their wish to become registered here would come to pass. This, of course, was untrue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We found rotating workers working for nothing in aged-care facilities. The whistle was blown on this practice by good union members who worked alongside these workers. They saw the exploitation and were not prepared to put up with it. They contacted the union and blew the whistle. We were able to mitigate that and stop that practice happening. I saw nurses from China who were sent to the outback without any training in rural and remote nursing, working as hard as they possibly could with very little time off. They had their wages docked for 'expenses'—outrageous amounts of money taken from their pay packets for things like accommodation, food and other expenses. Again, union RNs blew the whistle on this practice. The union was brought in, and we were able to help.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard terrible stories. I met with workers at a factory who pulled up stumps and went on strike because a worker on a temporary visa was sent into a very unsafe situation in a factory. He was told that it cost too much to turn the machines off for him to get in there and clean underneath the machine. It was actually a chicken decapitating factory—I don't mean to get too explicit about this. As a result of those blades spinning around and the employer not turning off the machines, that man was killed. He was too scared to speak up. He was too scared to say, 'This is dangerous.' He was too scared to say he didn't want to go in there and clean that factory floor, because he thought he would lose his job. He thought his family would be unsafe back home. He wanted to stay.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is so important because of all the people that have been exploited. It enhances the ability of our visa and enforcement system to stand up and tackle worker exploitation, and it focuses on targeting employers and third parties who misuse our migration program. The bill aims to strengthen employer compliance and ensure that businesses that do the right thing and abide by the law are not undercut by competitors who are not upstanding and who set out to undermine workers. In the case of the so-called traineeships and the internships, for example, who can compete with slave labour? Nobody.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see exploitation all around us, and this government is committed to addressing it. The bill will bring in new criminal offences, implementing a recommendation of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, making it an offence for a person to knowingly pressure or influence a worker to breach a condition of their visa. It gives effect to the recommendations I just mentioned. It increases the penalties for employers who do the wrong thing and misuse our migration program and migration rules. It gives the Australian Border Force tools to support employers to do the right thing. Importantly, it repeals section 235 of the Migration Act, which criminalised speaking out. We know this is a barrier for workers. We know workers have been afraid to speak out and report exploitation. In our national workplace relations system, laws should apply to all workers, regardless of their visa status.</span>

Since coming to government, the Albanese Labor government has worked tirelessly to slash the visa backlog. We've reduced the number of pending visa applications, from one million to 600,000. Temporary skill shortage visas for health and education workers are underway. We've given TPV and SHEV holders a pathway to permanency. We have flagged our intention to increase the number of community sponsored visas for asylum seekers, over and above the humanitarian intake. We've reduced our citizenship backlog to the lowest level in six years, and we've given 380,000 New Zealanders a pathway to citizenship in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government was elected on a promise to get wages moving, and that's exactly what we've done. To do that, we need to close the loopholes that undermine wages. One of the first things we did after forming government was pass the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill. Because of our government's reforms, Australian workers now have access to a better workplace bargaining system, which will help lift wages, improve job security and close the gender pay gap. The 'secure jobs, better pay' bill is also about in enshrining gender pay equity as an objective of the Fair Work Act. We've abolished pay secrecy clauses. We've introduced 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave, which is so important. No woman should ever have to choose between her job and her safety. This entitlement is now enshrined in the National Employment Standards for around 11 million employees. We've invested a record $11.3 billion to pay for a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, a workplace where I know many migrants find a career. </span>

This bill is a natural extension of all of those other bills that are making wages and conditions better and keeping workers safe. As the minister for immigration said, 'We cannot build our nation on the back of those being exploited.'</span>

She has dedicated so much of her working life to eradicating worker exploitation and ensuring that there's fair treatment of workers right across this country, and she is a source of inspiration to many of us in this House. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise today to speak in favour of the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. The Albanese government recognises that Australia's long-term economic prosperity cannot and should not be achieved through the exploitation of migrant workers. For those of us in this House who are committed to being good neighbours, this is where we can start ensuring that we are good neighbours—by making changes to this incredibly troubling practice that has unfortunately grown over the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that one in six migrants are paid below the minimum wage, the wage that we know is the minimum for a family to potentially get by on in a frugal way. Regrettably, most of these workers will be too scared to question this, too scared to speak to a union and too scared to speak out because of the potential consequences. Some employers will even threaten them with a phone call to the Australian Border. The prevalent theft of wages among migrant workers equates to an economic race to the bottom. No-one wins. Our neighbours don't win. It undermines the institution of our minimum wage, and it punishes employers—the majority of employers—that are doing the right thing. If the economic viability of your business is based on underpaying vulnerable migrant workers, then your business model is deeply flawed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 for the purpose of strengthening employer compliance measures and protecting temporary migrant workers from exploitation. To support greater compliance, the bill introduces criminal offences for employers who choose to coerce temporary migrant workers into working in breach of their visa conditions, and establishes a mechanism to prevent such employers from employing additional migrant workers for a period of time. It's an important consequence for particularly bad behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces amendments designed to remove some of the disincentives for temporary migrant workers to report exploitation. Currently they might fear that their visa status would be jeopardised by actually making such a report. It cannot be that, in modern Australia, migrant workers hardly get fair pay—as I said before, one in six are underpaid—because their employers think it's okay to treat temporary visa holders differently from Australian workers. It is not simply unfair and illegal; at the heart of it, it is un-neighbourly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government inherited an immigration and visa system in crisis. Too many tasks were placed in the too-hard basket. One of those was the exploitation of migrant workers. This led to an unchecked rise in exploitation. When the heat finally got too much, the previous government commissioned the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, back in 2016. After three years of listening to stakeholders, the taskforce made recommendations, some of which were cherrypicked and some were put into a bill that the previous government introduced, but it never seemed likely that that bill was going to make it to a vote. It should come as no surprise that on immigration reform, like so many other areas, those opposite dropped the ball. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The immigration legacy that the Albanese government inherited included a system that prioritised temporary visas over permanent visas, changed visa rules to restrict workers' rights, and removed pathways to residency. The enforcement of what little regulation migrant workers had protecting them was actively rolled back. Up until now, the benefits of exploiting migrants outweighed the consequences, and bad employers have made the most out of it—as I said before, a minority, still, but nonetheless having an incredible impact on our migrant neighbours. This legislation, importantly, changes this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the critical parts of tackling exploitation is the need for a functional and well-administered visa system. We know that a system with long waiting times and poor client services creates additional vulnerabilities for the community and the government; another failure in the government's response to migrant worker exploitation. For people who have been exploited, the Migration Act has criminalised speaking out. Section 235 of the Migration Act makes it a criminal offence for a visa holder to work in breach of a work related visa condition or for an unlawful noncitizen to work at all. Although this criminal offence has not been prosecuted since it was introduced more than two decades ago, this government understands that workers are afraid to speak out. We intend to change that. A key element of this bill is to repeal this offence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to discuss some of the findings and highlight the work from the Migrant Workers' Taskforce. One finding was the underpayment of migrant workers. As has been discussed in the chamber today, underpayment is a long-standing problem with significant impacts for affected individuals, for the labour market and for the broader community. But it's difficult to precisely quantify the prevalence and severity of the problem. Just two months ago, Professor Allan Fels, chair of the taskforce, told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Fels has also made it clear that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Wage exploitation of temporary migrants offends our national values of fairness. It harms not only the employees involved, but also the businesses which do the right thing. It has potential to undermine our national reputation as a place for international students to undertake their studies and may discourage working holiday makers from filling essential gaps in the agricultural workforce. This problem has persisted for too long and it needs concerted action to overcome it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Fels is right. This has gone on for too long, and it is disgraceful that migrant workers have had to wait until now for proper action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The taskforce also identified that there are a number of vulnerabilities to workplace exploitation that are common among migrant workers, including limited English language skills, lack of awareness of Australian workplace laws, and, as I mentioned earlier, a fear of visa cancellation, detention and removal from Australia. Additionally, peer and community or family expectations, norms within cultural groups, as well as economic settings in visa workers' home countries can also influence their decisions regarding low-paid work. Research shows that, even where migrant workers are aware of legal minimum wages, some will still accept much lower pay rates. One research article the task force cited was from a 2015 study of international students in Sydney, which found that international students tolerate and accept lower than lawful wages not only because the wage rates can be high in comparison to their home countries but also because lower than lawful wages are normalised and accepted among their international student peers. This must end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exploitation of these workers was found to take many forms, such as wage underpayment or cashback arrangements; pressure to work beyond the restrictions of a visa; upfront payment or deposit for a job; failure to provide workplace entitlements such as paid leave, superannuation and many things that we take for granted; tax avoidance through the use of cash payments to workers; unpaid training; working conditions that are unsafe; unfair dismissal; misclassification of workers as independent contractors instead of employees—that sounds a bit familiar—and requiring migrant workers to use and pay for substandard onsite accommodation. This problem is not isolated to one or two sectors of employment in the economy; it's more diverse than that. It stretches from remote fruit picking to convenience stores in regional cities and the global ICT multinationals in our capital cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex issue, but to not respond to this soundly would be giving dodgy businesses the green light to maintain the status quo. It would be the same as surrendering this issue to the too-hard basket, which is not what Labor governments do. That's why there are six parts to the Albanese government's approach to addressing this systemic problem. Part 1 of this legislation enacts new criminal employer sanctions. New criminal and civil offences are being introduced concerning coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions or using their visa status to exploit workers. The penalty will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. This will be an important deterrent to employers who think about exploiting workers due to visa conditions. By adding such strong penalties we can disincentivise those employers actively doing the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of the bill prohibits employers and individuals from hiring future workers on temporary visas. These new prohibition notices will enable the minister to declare employers and individuals to be prohibited from hiring new workers on temporary visas for a period of time. Employers and individuals will be subject to these discretionary prohibition notices when they are found to have breached migration and employment law. Triggers for prohibition will include court orders and noncompliance with employment and migration law. Where employers and individuals are subject to such notices, the minister must publish the relevant details on the department's website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 3 aligns and increases the penalties for work related breaches. Penalties are increasing for work based breaches to align with the maximum penalties available under the Migration Act. This is intended to better reflect the seriousness of illegal work practices and the exploitation of temporary migrant workers. This will see penalties increase from 60 units to 240 units, which is designed to send an important message to businesses thinking about exploiting migrant workers. Part 4 of this bill will enable enforceable undertakings for work related breaches. This amendment will seek to give similar provisions under the Migration Act to the Australian Border Force. This will provide the ABF with additional tools in their enforcement approach. The ABF asked for more tools to enforce compliance, and this bill will do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally this legislation will empower migrant workers to speak out without fear of visa implications. Under the Migration Act the exploitation of a worker will be able to be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. This will send an important message to migrants who are on temporary visas and who are worried to speak up that their visa will not be cancelled if they are being exploited. This will bolster the usage of the assurance protocol, a process that is used between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Home Affairs, designed to ensure that, when people report their employer to Fair Work, they are not penalised by the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reflects the government's strong principle that approaches to employment and migration will work side by side to address exploitation. The Fair Work Act and the Migration Act will work together to protect workers regardless of their visa status. The Albanese government is working to address all aspects of this issue, and that includes ensuring that Australia has a functioning and efficient visa processing system. Those that suffered the most from migrant worker exploitation were the ones we relied on at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was visa holders who were stacking shelves, staffing hospitals, delivering essential care or delivering food to those stuck in home quarantine. In effect, they were being good neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank, for their coordinated efforts, Ministers O'Neil, Burke and Giles, who've worked together to ensure that this issue can be addressed properly—not with a bandaid but with legislation with a vision to end the exploitation of migrant workers so that we will be good neighbours to all our brothers and sisters across this country. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. The Albanese Labor government is a government for workers. From raising wages, to improving industrial relations, the government is delivering for workers. Every worker in Australia should expect to have their rights respected and to be free of exploitation. This government intends to pursue this goal without exception. The exploitation of workers' rights is a threat to all workers' rights. Exploitation brings down wages and worsens working conditions. Exploitation damages our national reputation and is a threat to national values. That's why this government is taking action to protect vulnerable migrant workers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is addressing recommendations made in a report by the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, a report that was made to the previous government in March 2019 and that the Albanese government is now taking action on. This report was initially commissioned in response to revelations published about the significant and widespread wage theft occurring across multiple industries by employers underpaying migrant workers. It's a national embarrassment, as a result of the decade of inattention by the previous government. According to the report, almost half of all temporary migrant workers may be underpaid in their employment. Migrant workers are especially vulnerable to exploitation due to issues such as language barriers, financial limitations and a lack of access to support and information about industrial relations. Unfortunately, some employers have tried to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. They misrepresent the worker's rights and ignore their own responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do understand that there will be discussions as to how many of these offences could be considered accidental and that perhaps some of them were the result of honest mistakes. However, I'll quote the taskforce chair from the report's overview:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Wage underpayment may be inadvertent, but the outcome is no different as to when it is deliberate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Theft is theft, and ignorance is little consolation for the victims. This government will endeavour to make sure that the law is administered fairly and equitably and that every offence has a consequence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this abuse is not limited to wage theft. The Migrant Workers' Taskforce detailed the many different forms that this exploitation can take. These include, but are not limited to, pressuring workers to work beyond the restrictions of a visa, such as student visa work limits; failing to provide workplace entitlements, such as paid leave and superannuation; avoiding tax, through the use of cash payments; not paying workers for training; not maintaining safe working conditions; unfairly dismissing workers; misclassifying workers as independent contractors instead of employees; making unfair deductions from wages for accommodation, training, food or transport—and these are perhaps some of the worst ones—threatening to hold a person's visa so that it would be cancelled by authorities; withholding a visa holder's passport; or requiring migrant workers to use and pay for substandard onsite accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rights to worker safety and to be treated fairly are things that Australian workers have fought hard to obtain and maintain as a basic standard for work in this country. We cannot and will not allow these basic rights and conditions to be circumvented, which is why the government introduced the bill to parliament. The bill is delivering on two key recommendations of the report from the Migrant Workers Taskforce. First:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements these two recommendations. Through this bill, the Albanese Labor government will establish a new criminal offence and civil penalties to deter employers from using a visa condition or status to pressure and exploit their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also be increasing the maximum criminal and civil penalties for all current and proposed work related offences and provisions in the Migration Act. These penalties will be almost tripled, with civil penalties of up to $99,000 for individuals and $490,000 for bodies corporate. The message this government is sending is clear: there will be no more profit from exploiting vulnerable workers. This is a sensible decision and in the best interests of everyone. The reputation of Australian employers is tarnished by those who ignore their responsibilities. This will help restore the confidence among multiple sectors of industry, and it will help those employers who are already doing the right thing and doing a good job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also carefully extend the prohibition power to include breaches of the Fair Work Act and the Migration Act. It will ensure workplace relations law and migration law are working together to protect workers and penalise those employers who don't abide by the law. This will also include breaches of compliance notices and enforceable undertakings. A safe workplace is a better workplace—better for workers and better for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure these laws are properly complied with, the government is strengthening the Australian Border Force. The Albanese government is creating additional tools for the ABF, such as a new compliance notice and enforceable undertaking powers. The government is providing the Australian Border Force with $50 million over the next four years, to provide them with extra resources needed to investigate and enforce compliance in all areas of our immigration system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will penalise those who exploit the system but will protect those who are being exploited. Previously, under the Migration Act, it was a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition. Unfortunately, this legislation only served to deter workers from speaking up, because they feared criminal sanctions. Employers could also use the threat of reporting workers to authorities in order to silence and therefore control them. This government is moving to ensure that the legislation cannot be used as a means of intimidation or a cudgel against innocent workers. The government has taken its duties and responsibilities seriously, while maintaining the insight to be able to distinguish the victims from the perpetrators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just part of a range of measures that this government is taking to prevent and end the exploitation of those who come to Australia on temporary visas. In preparing this bill, this government has consulted widely with members of the public, unions, industries and researchers, but we are also currently engaging on complementing measures to help people speak up about exploitation in their workforce. This includes exploring the possibility of a whistleblower visa and the implementation of a firewall between the employment regulator and the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would especially like to thank those unions who've stood up for migrant workers, such as the National Union of Workers. These offences and crimes affect all of us, and it is our responsibility to look out for one another and call out abuse when it happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made supporting workers its cornerstone. We've been making improvements constantly and consistently, across a range of sectors, to create better conditions for everyone, and this legislation before the House today is another step in the right direction. We recognise that it is a government's duty to protect and empower those who are most vulnerable. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I thank those who have contributed to this debate. The exploitation of vulnerable workers is corrosive. Exploitation hurts all Australians: businesses who do the right thing; Australian workers, whose wages and conditions are undercut—it's a handbrake on wages growth—and of course those workers who themselves are mistreated and exploited. For these reasons we find the exploitation of migrant workers abhorrent to our sense of what is right and fair. This bill shows the Albanese government is serious about tackling exploitation. This bill includes measures to improve the visa system and enforcement regime to better address migrant worker exploitation. This bill will strengthen employer compliance and help to ensure law-abiding Australian employers are not undercut by unscrupulous competitors. This bill will implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the report of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce and includes several additional measures to address barriers that prevent exploited temporary migrant workers from speaking out and seeking support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes three offences to address the misuse of migration rules to exploit migrant workers. If passed, it will be a criminal offence to use a worker's visa status, including unlawful status, or a future work related visa requirement to coerce or unduly pressure a person into accepting an exploitative worker arrangement. Together the new offences penalise unscrupulous employers for taking advantage of vulnerabilities associated with the migration rules. The prohibition measure will help to protect temporary migrant workers from employers who've engaged in serious, deliberate or repeated noncompliance with their obligations. This measure demonstrates the Albanese government is committed to protecting workers from employers who've broken the trust of our community. The increases in penalties reflect the significant damage the actions of unscrupulous employers can have on Australia's visa program integrity and public confidence in our migration system more broadly. They've been set at a level designed to deter people from offending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enforceable undertakings and compliance notices are important new tools to ensure the Australian Border Force can promote compliance without resorting to legal proceedings, where this is appropriate. The aim is to reinforce a graduated approach to compliance and enforcement, working with people who seek to genuinely do the right thing, while reserving the strongest penalties for deliberate, repeated and serious breaches. Section 235 of the Migration Act makes it a criminal offence to breach a visa condition. This has undermined the ability of workers to seek recourse to their rights under certain workplace laws. This decision to remove it is consistent with recent amendments to the Fair Work Act which confirmed the national workplace relations system should apply to workers in Australia regardless of their immigration status. This is critical for the protection of all workers in our community. The bill also introduces an avoidance-of-doubt clause to resolve potential unintended consequences associated with breaches of work related visa conditions that may inadvertently contribute to the abrogation of employer responsibility to provide workplace rights and entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final substantive measure included in this bill is the introduction of a power to permit the migration regulations to prescribe matters to be taken into account in a decision whether or not to cancel a visa under section 116 of the Migration Act, as well as the weight given to those matters. We will continue to work with stakeholders to find a solution that will effectively protect vulnerable workers within the broader context, delivering a well-managed migration program in the national interest. These goals are mutually reinforcing, and I am committed to ensuring this can happen. I intend to consider all advice in consultation with my colleagues, and together we will ensure the regulations provide necessary protections to encourage workers to come forward and report exploitation, while maintaining the integrity of our visa programs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill creates new powers, new penalties and a new approach to tackling the exploitation of workers who hold a temporary visa in Australia. Alongside the measures in this bill, the government increased funding for immigration compliance in the 2023-24 budget. For too long the consequences of doing the wrong thing and the chances of getting caught have been far too small. Thank you to all those who participated in the Senate committee report on this bill. Our parliamentary process is always stronger when informed by deep engagement with the community. The government will be putting forward amendments to this bill in the Senate, touching on a number of those matters raised. I also thank the opposition for their in-principle support for the bill and look forward to further engagement with them and other members and senators as we progress these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So many workers who hold a temporary visa make a significant commitment when they leave their home to come to Australia. It is unconscionable that some employers target these very workers as cheap and exploitable labour. It's critically important for the government to demonstrate its strong commitment to addressing worker exploitation, because this is the right thing to do and because it is squarely in our national interest. We cannot build our nation on the back of exploitation. This bill deserves support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023. The Albanese Labor government have made it clear that our priority is helping Australians with the cost of living. One way we have done this is to ease the cost of energy. We know that energy bills are putting a strain on Australian businesses and households. Too many people continue to pay for energy that is leaking out of buildings and from inefficient appliances. In the short term this government is delivering up to $500 in energy bill relief for eligible households, and up to $650 for eligible small business. But this government is also able to act decisively in the long term as well, by laying the framework for the transition to a cleaner and more energy efficient economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government wants to give families the tools, the information and the access to the cheap financing they need to take control of their energy bills and to choose effective upgrades for their homes and businesses, all while lowering emissions. In the most recent budget, this government made it clear that we are investing in the future and we are investing in Australians. We are investing in our energy-saving plans to make homes and businesses and social housing more energy efficient and to drive down energy costs. We're investing $1.3 billion to establish the Household Energy Upgrades Fund to turbocharge financing options for energy upgrades for more than 110,000 households. We are investing in partnerships with states and territories to support energy upgrades for 60,000 social housing properties, and investing over $300 million in the Small Business Energy Incentive to help 3.8 million small and medium businesses. These businesses will have an additional 20 per cent deduction on spending that supports electrification and more efficient use of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing over $36 million to expand and upgrade the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme to apply to existing homes. This will give Australian consumers the power to seek a home energy rating so that they can be informed and able to make choices in their best financial interests for energy upgrades for renting and purchasing homes. This funding will also expand and modernise greenhouse energy minimum standards so that more appliances are covered by energy efficient ratings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to this bill and to the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act, known as the GEMS Act. It was a Labor government that made this legislation, which sets minimum energy performance standards and energy labelling requirements for products and appliances. Like many commonsense Labor policies it has endured, and it has been Australians who have reaped the rewards of the government's foresight at that time. For the decade it has operated it has saved the average Australian household between $140 and $220 on their electricity bill each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021-22, Labor's energy standards are estimated to have saved Australian households and businesses between $1.3 and $2 billion in avoided energy costs. They were estimated to have delivered an emissions savings of between 4.1 and 6.3 million tonnes in 2021-22, about one-quarter of South Australia's annual emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is a shame that the following government was unable to build on the work that had been done, it is a credit to the previous Labor government that was able to craft legislation that has continued to benefit Australians for over 10 years, and today this Labor government seeks to add to and improve upon that Labor legacy. This bill will implement technical changes arising from an independent review of the GEMS Act undertaken in 2019. The review's overall assessment was that reform is required to modernise the act to reflect changes in the energy operating environment, to build on the already significant outcomes of this successful program. The government is prepared to implement these recommendations and make a good act even better. This bill will be acting on key review recommendations 13, 18 and 33, and is the first phase of a raft of amendments that will further enhance the GEMS Act. This bill will reduce the administrative burden for products. It will streamline the application of test standards and the granting of exemptions. It will reform grandfathering provisions and grant powers to the regulator regarding the payment of fees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 of the bill will amend the act to provide flexibility for the suppliers of customised products in complying with the act by refining registration requirements for such products. Part 2 of schedule 1 to the bill will provide greater flexibility for how suppliers of GEMS products can demonstrate compliance with GEMS determinations. Suppliers often apply for an exemption from being subject to GEMS determination ahead of a GEMS determination coming into force, as they have identified potential issues with meeting the new requirements and want certainty as to how their product will be dealt ahead of time. Part 3 of the bill will improve the timeliness of these exemptions during the transition to new requirements and will allow exemptions to be more targeted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 4 of the bill will provide greater flexibility in defining product classes to ensure effective descriptions of product classes in GEMS determinations. This will assist with regulation of certain subsets of models identified by the regulator as being difficult to administer—for example, products like motors which may be supplied with other equipment. Part 5 of the bill will allow certain other requirements to be made under determinations which have labelling requirements but do not set minimum standards for energy use. Part 6 of the bill will amend the act so that the GEMS Regulator's position can be occupied by a person acting as an SES employee that references to the GEMS Regulator and refers to the substantive or acting SES employee in that position. This will improve the timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of the act when the substantive GEMS Regulator is absent from duty or when long-term acting arrangements are in place. The bill will also modernise references to the GEMS Regulator in the act to align with best-practice drafting standards and also extend the grandfathering exemptions from the prohibitions on supplying or offering to supply a model of product that is not registered. Part 8 of the bill will give the regulator the power to extend the time to pay application fees that would otherwise be payable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GEMS Act is one tool in this government's apparatus that finds smart ways to manage demand not just to use less electricity but to use it when it is cheapest and cleanest. It is all part of the National Energy Transformation Partnership. For the first time ever there is an agreed national plan between states, territories and the Commonwealth to support Australians through this nation's massive energy transformation. The updated GEMS Act will be part of that process by helping to make homes and appliances more energy efficient. It will also deliver the National Energy Performance Strategy. This provides a framework of supporting policies through which the government provides clear guidance on longer-term direction for energy performances. It will build on existing energy efficiency policies already in place to improve energy affordability, such as through the trajectory for low-energy building. Further improvement to the regulation of energy performance standards are being considered as part of the development of the National Energy Performance Strategy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has hit the ground running when it comes to shifting our energy economy from clinging to the past to embracing our future. We have struck the balance early between delivering for our nation's sustainability and delivering for households and businesses. We act sensibly and responsibly to the global pressures affecting the cost of living, and we recognise that we can streamline and enhance existing legislation to make the energy transition a smooth and stable one. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  The rising cost of living means people across the country are doing it tough, and energy bills are a big contributor. After a decade of energy policy failure we have been left overly dependent on expensive coal, gas and imported foreign oil, and Australians are paying the price, with one in 10 people skipping meals to pay their energy bills. Luckily, one of the biggest levers available to reduce the cost of living is close to home. Transitioning households and businesses away from expensive and inefficient fossil fuel appliances and towards cheaper and more efficient electrical alternatives is a $300 billion opportunity to permanently reduce our power bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minimum standards really matter for this transition to cleaner, cheaper energy. They matter when you're buying a property, when you're a renter, in the office and in the factory because our power bills and our carbon emissions are driven by the energy we use from the appliances in our homes and in our businesses. Because these appliances can be quite expensive, we don't tend to buy them very often, so the choices we make when we do, when we decide to buy a new fridge for our home or an air conditioner for our business, lock in energy costs and carbon emissions for several years to come. The role of minimum standards and of product labelling is to help consumers make the best choice for their hip pocket and the planet. They can steer us towards buying appliances that use less energy and so are less costly to run, and they can prevent us from buying old and inefficient models which might have a good-looking price tag but will hurt us in the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By setting minimum standards and labelling requirements for small and large energy-consuming items, the GEMS Act has played an important role in bringing power bills down for Australian homes and businesses. Indeed the current provisions in the act are estimated to save the average household between $140 and $220 per year on their electricity bill. This legislation, the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023, strengthens the GEMS Act further by improving the flexibility of administration and making compliance easier for business, but there remains more work to be done. The 2019 independent review of the GEMS Act, conducted by Anna Collyer, now chair of the AEMC, made 40 recommendations on how the regime could be improved, eight of which require legislative change. This bill implements just two of the legislative recommendations, which means important gaps remain, and I want to speak briefly to two of those gaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first gap relates to the scope of products covered by minimum standards and labelling requirements. Energy Consumers Australia estimate our current requirements cover only around half of the products of comparable countries. This means we have a big untapped opportunity to further reduce household power bills and emissions by expanding the scope of the GEMS regime further. If peer countries can do this, so can Australia. I want to echo calls from Energy Consumers Australia, the Energy Efficiency Council and the Smart Energy Council to expand the coverage of the GEMS Act at the earliest available opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second gap is the lack of mandatory demand-response provisions under the GEMS Act. As AEMO's report highlighted the other week, Australia faces real challenges when it comes to the pace of our transition and to the reliability of our energy supply. Coal plants are ageing and unreliable, gas remains expensive and we haven't done enough to get new, cheaper renewable projects on line. AEMO's report also highlights that distributed energy resources and demand response are big opportunities to address these challenges. If we can shift electricity to better balance supply and demand, we can deliver lower power prices and more reliable electricity supply. Demand response can lower the amount of electricity required from the grid during peak periods, reducing the likelihood of a blackout. It can shift demand to off-peak periods, or when renewable energy output is high, so that we use excess electricity more efficiently, and it can even help bring down wholesale electricity prices, which increase when demand is high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minimum standards that apply to our largest electrical appliances will determine whether we can use demand response or not. At the moment, there is no mandatory demand response provisions in the GEMS Act. This means we have a big untapped opportunity. For example, industry estimates suggest that demand responsive air-conditioners in New South Wales have more capacity than two coal-fired power stations combined. Rather than use taxpayers' money to bail out another ageing and unreliable coal plant, it makes sense to take advantage of the demand response opportunity. This was an important recommendation of the 2019 independent review and needs to be progressed with urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, though it's outside the scope of this bill, I urge the government to go further in household electrification and support for households to do this because this is good for the environment and good for households who are hurting so badly at the moment. The government has the opportunity to be a much stronger leader in this space. The government has the opportunity to ensure that new houses do not have gas connections, because we know that pumping fossil fuels into new houses doesn't make sense now and will not make sense in the future. We know that the government could go further and should go further in ensuring that there are strong financial incentives for households to move on to efficient electrical appliances. We know that the government should support a one-stop shop so that consumers and households across the spectrum—from renters in a 100-apartment block, to people who own their own home—know what steps they need to take and have a practical, well-informed and clear evidence base for their finances, in terms of how to step out of fossil fuels and into clean energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government can increase standards across the board to ensure that renters, in particular, get homes and households that are energy efficient. The government needs to be more ambitious now. We can make a bigger difference right now, and that will make a difference to people's lives but also support this transition when it is so difficult to get the transmission right across poles and wires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the minister and assistant minister are committed to further strengthening the GEMS regime. I welcome the commitments made in the May budget and the assistant minister's second reading speech, and I look forward to the upcoming publication of the National Energy Performance Strategy. These are important initiatives, and I commend the government for them. I also welcome the very constructive discussions that other members of the crossbench and I have had with the assistant minister over the last few days, both in relation to expanding the GEMS regime and to working through the details incorporating demand response into the act.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I rise to speak on the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill. The act that we are amending today has been around for just over a decade and was introduced by the Gillard government in 2012. Since its introduction it has proved to be instrumental in reducing emissions, particularly from Australian households. Research suggests that the average Australian family saves between $140 and $220 on their electricity bill each and every year as a result of the measures brought in through this bill. For Australian families facing cost-of-living pressures at the moment, reductions in costs like these are incredibly important. There is so much that can be done to reduce our power prices and our household emissions in one go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was very fortunate to be able to visit the home of a constituent of mine, Martin de Domenico, in Curtin, along with the Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Senator Jenny McAllister, who spoke to Martin about the absolutely incredible renovation he had just finished in his home. Martin's home is one half of a duplex built in the 1960s. Before the renovation, his home was cold and very inefficient, with the warmth literally leaking out of the house. His home, pre renovation, had an energy efficiency rating of 3.4 stars. Today, his home is rated at a massive 7.2 stars, which is a huge transformation. It was achieved through some relatively simple changes, including the use of double glazing in the windows, the installation of PV solar panels, the use of insulation, and the electrification of the hot water system, of heating and cooling and of the stove. Martin's home is now snug and airtight. It has an air-leakage permeability rate a quarter of the average Canberra home. This wasn't achieved with any special construction materials or equipment, either. Standard residential construction materials and methodologies were used, which kept construction costs low and provided for excellent thermal bang for buck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Canberrans know, we face extreme weather in our city. We have, obviously, very cold winters, but it's quite hot in summer, so we can often rely heavily on air conditioning and heating, which brings up energy costs and the emissions from our homes. So making these changes is really important, both for our bank balance and for the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Martin's home is now fully electric, and the gas meter has been decommissioned. The result of all this? While Martin's home is 29 per cent smaller than the average Canberra residence, it now consumes 68 per cent less energy than that same average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to really thank Martin for inviting us into his home and to congratulate him and the architects and scientists at Light House Architecture and Science for their incredible achievement of winning the Housing Industry Association Australian GreenSmart Sustainable Home of the Year. From visiting his home, this seems very well deserved, because not only was it efficient—and we heard that he had cut his energy bills by 70 per cent—but his home was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. You could just feel that it was actually keeping warmer from the sun coming through the windows—simple things like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can relate, just a little bit—not from having done such a beautiful renovation, but from also living in a 1960s Canberra home. When we moved in, we put some insulation in. It makes a huge difference and definitely does cut your power bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is helping Australians to save on energy and save on their bills. We want to make every watt count and put downward pressure on every Australian's power bills while lowering their emissions, because we know that their energy bills are placing significant strain on Australian businesses and households. We also know that, after 10 years of inaction by the former government, Australians are paying for the energy that is literally leaking out of their front doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Council's 2023 <span style="font-style:italic;">Smarter </span><span style="font-style:italic;">energy use</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> how to cut energy bills and climate harm</span> report found that combining electrification and practical efficiency upgrades could save an average Australian household $2,005 each year. And this is something that most Australians don't think about all that often. Most Australians know more about the performance of their washing machine or their fridge than they do about the performance of their home. That's why we're seeking to give families the tools they need to make their homes more comfortable and more affordable to run. This bill is just part of the effort to bring those savings to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly touch on some of those other measures that are being introduced by our government. We are investing over $1.7 billion to help businesses and households, including those in social housing, to access energy savings and upgrades through the Save Energy, Save on Bills Package. The package makes energy performance upgrades, like those seen in Martin's home, more accessible and affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, the Albanese government is investing $1 billion into Clean Energy Finance Corporation concessional loans and mortgages, through partnership with financial institutions, to incentivise household energy performance upgrades. These loans will help more than 110,000 households reach a net zero future and lower their energy bills. This could include upgrades to homes with battery-ready solar PV, better insulation and windows, and modern appliances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the same fund, we're investing a further $300 million to support energy efficiency upgrades to public and social housing, in collaboration with states and territories. This funding will help Australians in social housing properties upgrade the energy performance of their homes. It's estimated that up to 60,000 social housing properties will save around 30 per cent on their energy consumption each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our decarbonisation boost, the Albanese government is investing $314 million to allow small and medium sized businesses to deduct an additional 20 per cent of the cost of assets that support decarbonisation. The bonus tax deduction will be available for up to $100,000 of total eligible expenditure, with the bonus tax deduction capped at $20,000. This will help up to 3.8 million small and medium sized businesses with ongoing energy savings in the financial year 2024-25. From 2025 the government's investment of almost $25 million into the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme will expand and upgrade the scheme to apply to existing homes, which means people will be able to seek a star rating of their home's energy performance. And, of course, the measures in this bill will expand and modernise the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act, known as the GEMS Act, to help Australian households and businesses save on bills and emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main purpose of the GEMS Act is to set minimum energy performance standards and energy labelling requirements for products and appliances. The GEMS Act currently regulates 24 products, setting minimum energy performance standards and energy labelling requirements for products and appliances. In 2021-22, labelling and standards are estimated to have saved Australian households and businesses between $1.3 billion and $2 billion in avoided energy costs. They were estimated to have delivered emissions savings of between 4.1 million tonnes and 6.3 million tonnes in 2021-22, about a quarter of South Australia's annual emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're discussing today will implement technical changes arising from the 2019 independent review of the GEMS Act. The review found that reform was required to modernise the act to reflect changes in the energy operating environment and to build on the already significant outcomes of this successful program. The main provisions of this amendment bill will do a number of things: they will reduce the administrative burden for bespoke products; streamline the application of test standards and the granting of exemptions; reform grandfathering provisions; and grant powers to the regulator regarding the payment of fees. The government is also considering further improvements to the regulation of energy performance standards as part of the development of the National Energy Performance Strategy. This bill introduces a first phase of GEMS Act amendments targeted to streamline the implementation of the GEMS scheme and reduce unnecessary burden on our regulated community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address the specifics of what this legislation will achieve. Part 1 of the bill would amend the act to provide flexibility for suppliers of customised products in complying with the act by refining the registration requirements for such products. This part of the bill would implement recommendation 13 of the review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill would provide greater flexibility for how suppliers of GEMS products can demonstrate compliance with a GEMS determination. Suppliers often apply for an exemption from being subject to a GEMS determination ahead of a GEMS determination coming into force because they have identified potential issues with meeting the new requirements and want certainty as to how their product will be dealt with ahead of time. Part 3 would improve the timeliness of exemptions during the transition to new requirements and would allow exemptions to be more targeted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 4 of the bill would provide greater flexibility in defining product classes to ensure effective descriptions of product classes in GEMS determinations. This will assist with regulation of certain subsets of models identified by the GEMS regulator as being difficult to administer, for example for products like motors, which may be supplied within other equipment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 5 of the bill would allow certain 'other requirements' to be made under determinations which have labelling requirements but do not set minimum standards for energy use, and part 6 of the bill would amend the act so that the GEMS Regulator position can be occupied by a person acting as an SES employee and that references to the GEMS Regulator refer to the substantive acting SES employee in that position, as the case may be. This would improve the timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of the act when the substantive GEMS Regulator is absent from duty or when long-term acting arrangements are in place. It would also modernise references to the GEMS Regulator in the act to align with best practice drafting standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 7 of the bill would extend the grandfathering exemptions from the prohibition on supplying or offering to supply a model of a product that is not registered. The amendments of this part would also implement recommendation 18 of the review. Finally, part 8 of the bill would give the GEMS regulator the power to extend the time to pay application fees that would otherwise be payable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House, and I'm very proud of the efforts that our government is taking to make it easier for Australian households to not only cut their emissions but cut their power bills. Nowhere is this more important than in a place like Canberra with extreme weather—cold winters and hot summers—and a lot of older housing stock that isn't as well insulated. There are lots of simple changes that these policies can help support you to make so you can cut your emissions and have a more comfortable home as well as cutting your power bills, as Martin did, by up to 70 per cent. The Albanese government is really focused on those two things—on the climate action we need and on helping Australians with the cost of living.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I rise to speak on a seemingly machinery-type bill about regulation and setting modern standards, but there are a few issues in here that raise an even deeper and broader problem. The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill 2023 on the surface proposes minor changes that allow all appliances that are running on energy in the modern world—from your computer through to your kettle, your air conditioner or your fridge—to have, with this new scheme, maybe different scales on the little rainbow of stars on white goods, or maybe descriptions of equipment as having a better carbon footprint. All in all, efficiency is always good, in appliances as well as in the economy, but there are a few terms that kept appearing in the second reading speech about demand and facilitating demand management as one side of our efforts to reduce energy costs. This feeds into some concerns about the Integrated System Plan AEMO's making, which the good minister in the corner is very familiar with and which we've spoken about before. Modernising and updating the GEMS Act will support the National Energy Transformation Partnership and support the delivery of the National Energy Performance Strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the middle of the second page of the second reading speech delivered in the Senate, it talks about, again, demand-side measures:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Demand-side measures including improving the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment supplied in Australia can support Australia's net zero target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I might just add a bit of an explanation about what demand-side management is. There is a demand-side management program that happens in big-scale energy consumption and use, where, when the energy system's running out of energy, they ring up places like an aluminium smelter and say, 'Can you turn off that potline, which uses huge amounts of energy.' They turn it off for 55 minutes, so it doesn't solidify and blow up the whole potline and cost $20 million or $30 million, and then they'll turn the electricity off to another potline.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Producers just like this, adjacent to the border of my electorate, have been doing that out of the goodness of their heart to keep our under-resourced grid alive. There were many times in the last couple of years where if they didn't do that to reduce their demand, potentially, the whole grid would have gone off. Now, under the current rules, they're getting paid for that, whereas they used to do it before because they were concerned about the whole grid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the plan for demand-side management in the brave new world of AEMO's Integrated System Plan is that this will feature highly. All these smart meters that are now going to be put out across the grid will be able to find out what appliances are drawing what and which households are drawing what, and there will be wi-fi enabled inverters that will potentially turn off equipment that is drawing too much, like induction cooktops or your air conditioner. They may also, as part of the demand-side management, draw down on your Tesla's big battery, if it's plugged into the grid at the time. This is all part of the virtual big battery that is at the heart of a big chunk of where the electricity is going to come from in the brave new world in this transition. People should be very wary because, if Tomago Aluminium smelter is getting paid for this, I think individuals could be paid, which, then again, leads to increased costs and increased complexity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the face of it, this bill is a good idea. You've got to have modern standards for everything. We do want to have efficient machines. But if it's a cover that says, 'We've got to get a system in place so we can start managing people's own energy inside their house and turning things off when there's a shortage,' there will be people who will be mightily disappointed. That aside, I think it is good that Australia is pushing for energy efficiency because it's good economics. But I am concerned about what the same plan, with its demand-side participation scheme baked into it, which most people are oblivious to—except for big units, which people have for years already been told to turn off so the grid doesn't collapse—means for mums and dads who will have to lose their power if it has got to be drawn back into the grid. That would be a different response altogether. The best thing would be to have much greater generating capacity in our grid now. There are talks of drawdown and shortages during very hot weather. But, in the brave new plan where we're going to have most of our energy dependant on good weather and favourable winds, there are plenty of times when this demand-side participation will eventuate in order to keep the grid alive; otherwise we'll have total grid collapse. So you've got to understand that, in this new plan, your batteries in your car, if it's plugged in at the time, or your household batteries might be reversing the flow back into the grid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, we need to get back to this bill. As I said, it's a machinery bill. We do have to be supportive of efficiencies, but people need to take it as a pointer to what might be coming down the line to their homes soon if we do have shortages—when you have an East Coast slow; when the whole weather pattern across New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland is all rain. That's the fallacy of the idea that 'geographic distribution will reduce the risk of energy shortages'. The trouble is that the sun rises and sets within a couple of hours of each other, right up and down the eastern seaboard at the same time. So that means, every night, after dusk until well after dawn, all that excess energy that happens in the middle of the day is gone—lock, stock and barrel. Often when there's bad weather for solar generation, there's bad weather for wind generation. When these wind turbines work, they can only take and generate direct current when there's enough wind but not too much wind. They can't generate at all when there's no wind or low wind. And the weather has a horrible pattern of doing that over three or four months in Australia, when there are lots of low-wind events that go for 17-24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can have all the installed capacity of wind and solar, but, if we've got bad weather, their capacity factor drops to single figures or lower. There is not enough energy when you've got a weather-dependant generating system to both charge the batteries and operate the system, let alone keep one of the biggest, longest grids in the world intact. By all means, we've got to be efficient because we're going to have an energy shortage lots of times. So this is actually really important. But, in a perverse way, it would be much better to get some 24-hour, always spinning, always generating power stations back to being economic again, because at the moment they're falling over like tenpins because the business case for them has been eaten away by restrictive trade practices embedded in the National Electricity Market rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happening now in New South Wales, for instance? All of a sudden, the light bulb's gone on, and they've realised that New South Wales could black out if Eraring, with 2½ thousand megawatts, is not available. Hey presto! How long did it take them to work that out? We are expecting miraculous amounts of energy to be storing the batteries, as well as running the system, being transmitted left, right and centre across the country, with wonderful, amazing, pop-up grids that take years to deliver and cost billions of dollars! But the plan is to let this massive power station close, like they did with Liddell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Germany looked forward into the future and thought, 'We're going down the energy wind path and we will get rid of our power stations,' but they didn't blow them up. You can keep them, with care and maintenance. There is one old power plant amongst the 23 that has now fired up again, using brown coal, lignite and some black coal, from places like the Hunter Valley. It was built in the 1920s. They've kept it in reserve, through world wars, because they know cities, economies and nations run on energy, and, if you don't have energy, you don't have a modern industrial economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All those big cloud-computing data centres are huge users of energy. Around the world—I travelled to the UK and to America the year before, looking at things, meeting with Rolls-Royce, talking to think tanks in London—all these data centres are getting together. They're already planning their small modular reactors because they figure people have lost their senses and are overestimating the ability of renewables to keep grids and cities going through rain, frost, snow, tempests, storms, cyclones—you name it. They saw what happened when every solar panel in western Europe was covered with snow. Texas found out the hard way; they've had their blackouts. The New England network only survives out of the generosity of a nearby country—it's Canada—that has a bucketload of energy and lots of gas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In California, they've had the same thing. All the technocrats, the IT billionaires and other people with electric cars are used to being told, 'There's this thing called demand-side participation, and we need you to not charge your Tesla, because we don't have enough energy.' They were going to close the Diablo Canyon Power Plant four or five years ago. All the people who were irrationally against nuclear, mainly for renewables, thought, 'Good riddance,' and it was planned that it would go. But Joe Biden turned up and gave them a grant to keep it open and also put another $4 billion or $5 billion around America to keep the nuclear plants going so they didn't have to have demand-side participation and have to tell people not to charge their Teslas. They decided to keep Diablo Canyon open. I think there are about 160 members in their state legislature, and I am reliably told by an energy professor that the vote was 157 to three. You know that woke centre of America, California? They voted 157 to three to keep Diablo Canyon going because they need it because they want energy that's available 365 days of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear power is also good because you can get heat out of it that you can use to make hydrogen, that wonder thing that's going to be the cure-all. Nuclear power is great for energy storage—you know, that thing that we keep talking about? Well, instead of spending trillions of dollars on batteries every 10 or 15 years, you can have a couple of years of energy stored in one load of fuel in a nuclear plant. It's so dense and so thick. If you have a system with plenty of that, like France and like Ontario in Canada—they make a lot of money exporting electrons to the rest of Europe and to the rest of Canada, and they prop up the New England at other times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greenhouse and energy minimum standards amendment bill needs to come through because we're going to need every bit of help we can get. There will be energy shortages. The current federal government and, I would also add, the New South Wales, Queensland, Victorian and South Australian governments need to realise that we are going to have an energy shortage. We need to rethink our plan and allow the bans on nuclear to be removed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I want to thank all honourable members for their contribution to this non-controversial but important bill, the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Amendment (Administrative Changes) Bill, which makes changes to the GEMS Act. While minor, these amendments support the achievement of the objectives of the act by giving flexibility to help more energy-efficient products to be available in the Australian market. We need to be ready for our energy future, and what better way than to update the already significant program, which has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 60 megatonnes of CO2 and saved households and businesses between $11.8 billion and $17.8 billion over the course of it being in place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To meet the government's net zero target, it will be important to enhance our demand-side measures, including improving the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment supplied in Australia. I note the interest of the members of the crossbench in including more categories of products within the purview of the act, particularly demand-response capabilities, which can provide grid-firming resources at low cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill implements a number of recommendations of the 2019 independent review of the act. Our government is working through the balance of the recommendations, including those relating to the scope of the act, as part of the development of the National Energy Performance Strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again thank all honourable members for their contribution. I do have to say, though, that I think the member for Lyne made an unfortunate contribution in scaremongering about demand-side responses. Demand-side responses put consumers in charge. Scaremongering—saying that people are going to come and turn your lights off and take control of the energy in your house—isn't a useful contribution to the debate. Many consumers are taking the opportunity themselves to put virtual power plants in so that they can maximise their activity within the grid. It's something I've done as well. Demand-side responses are about empowering people. There's a long-existing work program—which the honourable member was referring to, although he didn't name it—which has existed under governments of all persuasions. There were lack-of-reserve incidents in 2019 and 2017 under the previous government, which is when there is a very severe shortage. Of course, the RERT played a very big role in that circumstance, as well. Those were arrangements entered into with big industrial users that they agreed to comply with and participate in. This is something very different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Electric vehicles have the opportunity to be batteries on wheels which can, in due course, feed back into grid if the consumer asks them to. The consumer is in control of when they charge and when they discharge into their house or into the grid. It's something which will be very important for stability, going forward. To scaremonger and say that somehow this will be a central command-and-control model is not a useful contribution to the debate. The honourable member for Lyne has just shown his party's disdain and disregard for renewable energy and their weird obsession with nuclear energy—the most expensive form of energy available. That's a debate I very much look forward to having in the lead-up to the next election. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

Other penalties will significantly increase to reflect the seriousness of the safety breaches. Recklessly exposing an individual to serious injury or death, a category 1 offence, will now carry a penalty of $15 million for bodies corporate, up from $3 million. Individuals face a $3 million fine, up from $600,000—and a $1.5 million fine for any other person. All other penalties in the WHS Act will increase by 39.03 per cent and will be indexed to CPI. A safe working environment is a right, and these increased penalties reflect the seriousness of violating that right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other measures in the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill that will improve and strengthen worker safety both inside and outside of the workplace include extending the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to address silica related diseases, improving access to workplaces by workplace delegates for safety and compliance issues and making it unlawful to discriminate against any employee who is or was subject to family or domestic violence. Another significant measure in this bill is the criminalisation of wage theft. No longer can employers intentionally steal from the pay packets of their workers without serious consequences. Intentional underpayment will become a criminal offence with a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and a maximum fine of either three times the amount underpaid or $1,565,000 for an individual or $7,825,000 for a body corporate, whichever is greater. This government is serious about protecting the wages of Australians, and these significant penalties reflect that. Wage theft is theft, and it's time to treat it as such.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there's not enough time to mention every measure contained in this bill that will improve the rights of workers. This includes measures that will protect workers from sham contracts, streamline workers compensation claims for first responders who sustain PTSD, improve worker access to enterprise agreements and strengthen the powers of the Fair Work Commission. The bill is the culmination of more than a year of consultation from across the Australian economy and is a continuation of our commitment as a government to protecting and strengthening the rights of workers. That was the Albanese Labor government's election commitment, and it's what good Labor governments do. I'm honoured to speak on this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  It's a sad day to have to rise and oppose this radical legislation the government is proposing in relation to industrial relations. We see a government for the first time, I think in many decades, deliberately attempting to undermine the industrial relations framework, the compact between employer and employee in Australia, by falsely naming this bill the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 when, in the consultation the government has been speaking about for the last year, every industry and business sector in country without exception said to the government that these are not loopholes. This is a falsely named bill. This is a bill that is empowering unions only, and it's deliberately designed to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look through the schedules of this bill and the explanatory memorandum of 500 pages, we learn even more about what the minister and the government are proposing, and it is perhaps the single greatest anti-productivity industrial relations bill in our nation's history. It is the word that cannot be mentioned by the Labor Party, productivity, and while they talk about pushing up wages, wages have to come with productivity or they are simply cost increases for consumers. That's what we're seeing in our economy, and that's what we see with this legislation before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be an increase in the cost of labour without even a thought about the anti-productivity measures that are contained within this bill. I'm only going to go through a few of them because I only have 15 minutes. The rush from this government to bring in this legislation without consultation and without proper consideration is another sign from the minister that he is not serious about enhancing productivity and lifting wages and increasing the prosperity of our economy. When you think about the economic climate that we're in, with the inflation crisis that the government speaks of every day, how is it timely to increase the cost of labour across the board, reduce productivity substantially from its already low base and have a complete breakdown in the regulatory framework between employer and employee in many critical sectors of the economy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to go through just some of the things that this bill proposes to do. The trick, of course, with the minister—I'd ask any Australian to watch carefully what the minister does—is to see his demeanour and his attitude in this House. The minister has been exceptionally angry at the dispatch box for months, screaming. Who's he screaming at? There's nobody in here to scream at. He's talking about how 10-year criminal penalties will come in for everything and employers have got to be on notice. He's screaming about loopholes that are just not loopholes. He's not listening to any single person. Where is his anger coming from? We're talking about businesses that employ people. We're talking about the industrial relations framework of our country, and it's unseemly for a minister to be screaming at the dispatch box every single day, overcome by anger. But there is a source of that anger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The source of that anger is the union movement, which has been frustrated for many decades now that it is not the dominant part of our labour compact in Australia. It is a diminishing market in the private sector. The strongest part of the union movement is in the public sector. They resent the fact that we have more employment in our economy than ever before that is not unionised. They resent the fact that people don't choose to join a union anymore. This minister and this bill are anti the future of our workforce and workplace in the sectors that have been innovative and creative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only sector that has broken off the shackles of a pretty difficult industrial relations system in Australia is the gig economy. Why would a minister for employment be so anti the gig economy? Why would a minister for employment describe the gig economy as a cancer when he was in opposition? The answer is because it can't be unionised and because it's a new form of work which is competing with the current employment system. It's a good form of work. Let's be overwhelmingly clear that the gig economy has provided the opportunity for more people to access more work on their terms than ever before because people can work when they want. They can work for the rate they want. They can choose to come in and come out of the workforce without having to comply with difficult and not suitable arrangements, and they do that by choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's led to a revolution in employment in Australia. It means that, through the pandemic when the government had to shut down society for emergency reasons, we were able to survive because we had this gig economy, whereas, in the past, it would have been a very difficult endeavour. Workers are choosing to work in the gig economy as a second job because our cost of living is so high and because getting a house is priced out of people's reach. People need to access new and different forms of labour. They're not looking for a long-term work contract. They're not looking for conditions with holidays and all those other benefits. The minister is so keen on making one type of employment the only type of employment you're allowed to have, and, if it doesn't suit his needs, it's a loophole; if it doesn't suit his union mates and his union mates' requirements of union membership, then it's somehow illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gig economy is providing younger people and people from different backgrounds and poorer backgrounds with opportunities to work in ways they want to work, when they want to work, and to innovate in terms of their own employment. The trick here is that the minister is so anti such an innovation in our workforce and the fact that it is providing millions of people with the hours they want, when they want them and at the rates they want and that they're doing very well out of it. He acts like this is the Middle Ages or it's indentured labour. Nothing could be further from the truth. He knows the truth is that people are choosing to do this work because it's for their benefit and because they get the rate of pay that they're seeking and they get to work when they want to work. He understands that, but he acts like the gig economy is somehow engaging in slave labour. Nothing could be further from the truth, and yet he stands at that dispatch box screaming at this House as if people are doing the wrong thing with an innovation in the employment market.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a real sense here that the Labor Party is actually being the conservative party. They want to take our industrial relations framework back to the 19th and 18th centuries. They want to have the contest between capital and labour that Karl Marx spoke about. That's the kind of thing they want to have, when actually we're looking to the future now. We have new emerging forms of employment, labour and industrial relations that need new frameworks—frameworks that recognise productivity, frameworks that take the opportunity of these new innovations and don't try to shut them down or feel threatened by them because of power based erosion in the union movement but actually recognise that new generations want new and different ways of working and that they should be available for people in new and different contracts. That's the truth of what the Labor Party's objection to the gig economy is. That's the truth, and don't let this government tell any young person in this country that they want you to have rights or to have a minimum standard. That is the moral blackmail in the rhetoric that is the foil behind them being threatened by the fact they cannot unionise these new forms of employment and they cannot gain power from them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the truth behind this bill. It is a poor truth, and it is something that the government should be ashamed to put their name to because gig platforms mean people can create their own businesses faster, can do their own types of work faster and can provide their own benefits and set their own terms and conditions. They're doing it without the need for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to be involved. They don't need the government to be involved in this part. We have a huge industrial relations framework in this country that provides all the minimum protections. We are one of the most regulated industrial markets in the world. We are the highest wage jurisdiction in the world, and yet the government says they want to artificially put up the prices. That's the reason in this legislation when we see the attached costs at $9 billion in the government's own costings. I don't believe that's correct, and industry is telling us that these costs are conservative because they don't model the changes to independent contractors and other forms of work that the government is proposing in the bill. About the $9 billion in extra wages, the minister has said, 'Well, look, that's only a tiny fraction of the wages in the whole economy.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is at a time when we're in a cost-of-living crisis. This is at a time when we have zero productivity growth, although productivity has been the major challenge in our economy for decades. We are not getting any productivity growth, so any increase in the wages bill, especially the $9 billion—and it is a very conservative figure, in anybody's language—is going to pass on costs directly to the consumer. Every good and every service will be more expensive. The cost of living will be more expensive. The inflation crisis will be added to in a very high-cost jurisdiction like Australia. We have very high costs, and we have very high standards. The government is pursuing our increased wage agenda artificially with no conversation about productivity. You couldn't think of a worse thing to do at a worse time for the country's economy and for our future productivity and employment requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you factor in the changes to other things that they describe as loopholes, like the casual arrangement that they have been going on about for a long time, first in opposition and now in government. They're threatened by the casual workforce. They have been trying to claim for years that the casualisation rate has increased, but the fact came out before the election, which was very inconvenient for the minister and this Labor Party, that the rate of casualise has maintained a stability. Over 30 years we have had about the same rate of casualisation in the economy, so they dropped that argument. To be fair to them, they're not mentioning it in this debate, but they are still fighting a war against the use of casuals. Why has the use of casuals in the economy come up in recent times? It is because every other avenue through the fair work system of employers and employees working things out has been narrowed down into less and less flexible structures, which means people have to use more casuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Casuals are a good thing for the people who take them on. They want to be casuals. That's the truth, and the minister has to acknowledge that. He says, 'I know most people won't take up these things, so there is no problem.' But why change it if it isn't a big problem? Why at six months should you factor in 11 factors—four sections and seven subsections in this legislation—for something that isn't a big problem for most of the workforce? People are going to benefit. They want to be casuals because they want higher rates of pay. The minister knows this, but he acts as if it is a major loophole. He knows it isn't a major loophole. He knows that a fraction of the problem here doesn't warrant the solution he has provided. Again, the agenda is very different. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing the flexibility in our industrial relations systems by the use of casuals in so many sectors right now is going to do one thing—it is going to increase costs for business, which is going to increase costs for all consumers, which is going to have zero productivity benefits with only cost increases. And that's the theme that industry is pointing to across the board—big business organisations, small business organisations. The idea that small business is exempt from this is not accurate. The minister and the government might say it is, but of course small business is going to be impacted by many of the things here and many of the antiproductivity measures that are contained within this bill. Everybody uniformly has come to a view that this bill is going to be retrograde for business, retrograde for productivity, retrograde for the cost of living—and yet the government wanted to ram this through very quickly. Thankfully the Senate has agreed to delay this, and no agreement has yet been reached on the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would say to the public: this is one of those issues where a government are using a set of fake arguments as a veneer for the true agenda of what they're trying to do in this bill. You have to look through some of the false claims they're making, such as that this is about safety. This bill is not about safety. Let's be very clear about that. Safety, of course, is an issue. Safety has to be addressed in many pieces of legislation. But the point of this bill, and the reason it's in front of us, has got nothing to do with safety. It is not going to achieve any safety improvements of any substantial benefit. That can be done through OH&amp;S and other workplace relations matters, and it has been, over many, many years, and we have onerous regimes at federal and state level, as everyone in business knows. This is not a safety issue. The moral claims about why we're doing this bill are actually false.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of this bill is that unions are under threat by modern workplaces, and they're unable to gain the cachet they need in the workplaces, and therefore the government, in a whole range of sectors, are going to smash through what they describe as loopholes but which are actually just the way the system has evolved—which is in most cases to the employee's benefit—and they're going to do that on behalf of the union movement. Some people might say that wouldn't matter. He says it's only a $9 billion cost, but actually the truth is that the cost could be two or three times that. It could be much higher when you factor in the changes to independent contractors. The government didn't even model the cost of the changes in many of the parts of this bill that they have put forward. That's why we have to have a close scrutiny of every single measure. They hadn't even modelled these costs, because they just don't care about independent contractors, even though the impact on independent contractors will be substantial under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the real cost going to be two times $9 billion or three times $9 billion? We simply don't know. But everybody agrees that $9 billion is not even a starting figure for the cost to business, without even a single excuse or skerrick of a reason that we're going to improve productivity. The government simply haven't even tried to make that argument, to be fair to them. They're not claiming any productivity improvements out of this bill. They know there are going to be none, and in fact there will be retrograde movement in productivity, which will therefore obviously make it more difficult and costly to employ people across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an impossibly complex bill in front of us, and there is no time today to go through all of the different complexities and measures. The House has been given very little time to do so, and I've had very little time with it myself. This is only scratching the surface of the complexity that this bill represents. I support industry in what they're doing to expose the government's agenda, the real agenda that is hidden within this legislation. The minister, instead of shouting at this House, needs to come forward and talk with some reason about what he is up to and how this bill works, because everything that he points to as a loophole is not a loophole. The gig economy is not a loophole; casuals are not a loophole; independent contractors are not a loophole. None of these things are loopholes, and yet all of the measures in this bill tackle significant parts of the structure of our industrial relations framework, with immense cost and very little benefit—no benefit for employers, but no benefit for employees either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very sad day, because we haven't got the time today to go through all of the different things, but hopefully now, with the Australian people, the industry sectors will apply a lot of scrutiny to the provisions of this bill, because there is so much buried here in this legislation that the government is trying to get away with with this complex and unnecessary legislation. We would urge the government to simply drop this legislation. I just think that now is exactly the wrong time in the economic cycle to be artificially increasing wages through extreme measures against business, with no productivity gains. You couldn't get a worse time, for cost of living and inflation, to do this to the economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 deals with a range of critically important issues. As the title suggests, it closes a range of loopholes. I want to dwell on loopholes for a moment, because loopholes arise in a wide range of contexts. They can arise when actions are taken by certain parties to get around legislation or regulation, or, alternatively, they can arise when a piece of legislation that was well-designed gets overtaken by events, when the nature of society or the nature of the economy changes. We see this all the time—for example, in relation to taxation, where we constantly refresh taxation bills in order to deal with both of the phenomena that I just described.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, those opposite never have a problem with that, but, when it comes to industrial relations, when it comes to workers' rights, then anything to do with closing loopholes or anything to do with adding to workers' fundamental rights will lead to the end of civilisation and the end of the economy! And of course it's all nonsense, as we've seen so many times before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill deals with many important issues. It deals with casual employees' rights. Now, nobody on this side is suggesting that the existence of casual employees is a bad thing at all—of course not. What we are saying is that a loophole exists where people who work on a casual basis do so on a permanent basis in a way that is not actually reflective of the nature of their work and where that, often, denies them rights that are absolutely fundamental. It denies them protections and security. It denies them the ability to get a mortgage, for example. So that's the kind of loophole that we are trying to deal with, not with casual work per se.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at labour force agreements, not because labour force agreements per se are a bad thing—of course not. They can be very important for dealing with surge workforce requirements. They can be very important for dealing with specialist skills. But where they are used to undercut basic conditions, then there are loopholes that need to be dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will look at the gig economy. We will look at wage theft. And I will deal with those in more detail. But I want to start with some of the issues that have been raised by those opposite—indeed, that were raised by the speaker most immediately past, and that is the scare campaign. It's the later stage of a multistage scare campaign. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to the election, where those opposite said that a $1-an-hour increase for those on the lowest wages, those most vulnerable in the economy, would see the sky fall in. Of course, since that time, we've seen the opposite. We've seen record jobs growth. So those opposite used ridiculous hyperbole and rhetoric during the election campaign. The electorate, fortunately, didn't buy it. And it hasn't led to any of the consequences that they said it would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the secure jobs, better pay legislation. We were told it would be the end of the economy, the end of employment. Of course, when it comes to the level of strikes, when it comes to wages—when it comes to all of the things that they said would be problematic—the reverse has ended up being true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we hear this rhetoric about productivity: 'We need more flexibility to get productivity going.' Those opposite use 'flexibility' as a euphemism for insecurity, for the race to the bottom. The reality couldn't be further from the truth. The way to boost productivity in a sophisticated economy is not to worsen people's conditions; it's not to make them more insecure. The evidence is clear, and it is the reverse. When people feel more secure, they invest more in highly specialised skills. When people feel more secure, they are more likely to invest in the particular skills of a particular employer. We see, in high-productivity, high-wage economies, that there is a clear link between people who are paid more and are more secure and their willingness to invest in greater skills that are specific to a particular firm or a particular sector. There is considerable evidence in some contexts that, particularly for some people on very low incomes, increasing their remuneration can lead to a greater attachment to and a greater willingness to exert effort for the firm that is paying them greater wages and providing them with more security. So there is absolutely abundant evidence in many contexts, particularly for people who are starting off in a position of very poor and very insecure conditions, that an improvement in their conditions can actually lead to behaviours, in terms of their effort and their investment in specialised skills, that actually lead to greater productivity. That's at the individual level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the societal level. Let's look at the highest productivity economies—economies like those of Scandinavia and Germany, where we don't see people forced into a race to the bottom; we see the opposite. In the highest productivity economies—Scandinavia and Germany being two very good cases in point—we see people with high job security. Indeed, in Germany—the manufacturing powerhouse and the high-wage manufacturing economy of the OECD—we see, in fact, a whole bunch of governance arrangements where unions have positions on management boards. So what those opposite say will lead to productivity, in fact, is not the case. It's a highly simplified, highly caricatured version of a first-year economics textbook which suggests that we need to reduce wages and increase insecurity in order to boost company profits and reduce costs, but it doesn't fly in the real world of complicated, sophisticated industries where we need to empower workers and give workers incentives to invest in human capital—to invest in themselves—for the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there are the broader benefits of the kinds of security we're talking about here. We don't want to create a whole class of people who are, through a contrivance, characterised as insecure workers, when it's not necessary for their work arrangements, so that they can't get a mortgage and can't take part in absolutely core social arrangements. Those opposite so often claim to be the party of home ownership, but—when we try to change arrangements that are fake contrivances, are unnecessary and force people to be characterised as insecure workers or casual workers when, in substance, they are long term, permanent part-time or full-time workers—those opposite are denying many people participation in many of these core social arrangements. When looking at productivity in a more holistic sense, again, those opposite take this route towards a race to the bottom and insecurity—a path which doesn't lead to the kinds of outcomes that they're claiming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's start with casual employees, an absolutely critical part of this bill. Nobody is saying that casual workers shouldn't exist. There are many, many people who like the casual arrangements that they are offered, but we find that there is this set of people on permanent casual arrangements, whether they be in part-time arrangements or full-time arrangements, who have been put into a situation where they are called casual, but what they are experiencing are not the kinds of circumstances that casual arrangements were originally set up to provide. These people lose job security and peace of mind. Indeed, in 2021, the AMA called for the minimising of financial barriers for insecure workers. Insecure work is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including mental ill-health, chronic disease and workplace injuries. Eight hundred and fifty thousand workers could be beneficially impacted by the pathways that are being offered by this bill, where, if you're on long-term arrangements that, in substance, are really ongoing, and you choose to translate that into ongoing employment, that is going to provide substantial benefits, in terms of your job security and your peace of mind, but also, as I mentioned earlier, your capacity in a broader sense to engage with a raft of social arrangements, such as getting a mortgage, which many people are currently excluded from, for no good reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at labour force agreements. Again, labour force agreements are often worthwhile. They can be a way in which firms can deal with the need for a surge in workforce numbers. They can be a way in which workforces can be supplemented by specialist arrangements. But labour force agreements, in some instances, can be used as a way of undercutting an enterprise agreement. Now, the arrangements that we're talking about in this bill will only apply in situations where there is an enterprise agreement. This bill will ensure that labour force agreements are not used for the predominant purpose of undercutting wages and conditions. That was never the intention of labour force agreements, and it is a highly inappropriate use of that structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me get on to the gig economy. I have spoken in favour of many aspects of the gig economy since my inaugural speech. I believe that there are many productivity-enhancing aspects of the gig economy, whether we look at the transport sector and point-to-point rides or meal delivery. But, despite the fact that the gig economy can in some instances lead to higher standards of service and greater efficiency in the utilisation of assets, such as cars in the case of Uber, there are concerning aspects of this sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, there is often a lack of transparency around remuneration. There have been many studies in the US showing that there are many workers on gig platforms are being paid less than the minimum wage, but that is unclear. We had the almost farcical situation in the last parliament where minister after minister was asked point blank, 'Can you guarantee that there aren't swathes of workers earning less the minimum wage,' and the response was 'it's complicated'. That level of lack of transparency is not appropriate. There are also, of course, a number of workplace safety issues arising in a number of contexts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has made it clear that we accept the technology, we accept the method of engagement, but we do need to strengthen the regulatory arrangements because the number of people on gig platforms is rising. As I said, there are many aspects of the gig economy which are beneficial both to workers and to the broader economy, but we need stronger and better arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, if you go to the Fair Work Commission and they ask, 'Are you an employee?' and you say no, you fall off the regulatory cliff. What this bill is doing and what this government is saying is we need a ramp, not a cliff. We need an intermediate set of arrangements that allow us to keep the best aspects of the gig economy to protect workers in an appropriate way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does it look like? Firstly, the bill proposes an arrangement where there's a gateway with a number of questions. If you're on a digital platform, does your work have employee-like characteristics? That would be a test that would be considered across a number of criteria. Do you have low bargaining power? Do you have low levels of control over the work that you do? Are you being paid low wages, in the sense that they are less than you would be paid if you were an employee? In considering all of these criteria, the Fair Work Commission can come to a decision as to whether or not a subset of protections should be offered to somebody working on gig platform. It might be that, having made a determination, some workers—not everyone working on gig platforms—might be offered, for example, minimum rates of pay, but in a way that reflects the nature of the work on the gig platform. It may not be hourly, for example; it may be based on smaller time increments. Another right that gig workers might be able to receive is not to be unfairly deactivated from the platform. Again, that's entirely reasonable and would reflect a mechanism by which you could keep the fundamental structure of the platform while providing workers on that platform with a reasonable subset of rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes create a situation for those workers where they go from effectively having no guaranteed rights to having a subset of guaranteed rights that are appropriate for the context. We need to move away from the contrivance that any worker on the gig platform is an independent contractor or small business. It's a contrivance which has led to a situation where too many people don't get any protection at all, and there are possibly well over half a million people that could benefit from these kinds of protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's wage theft—extremely important. It's almost so obvious that it doesn't need that much explanation. Of course, if an employee steals from their employer, then they are criminally liable. At the moment, the reverse is not true. Now, there are going to be instances where money isn't paid to a worker by accident or through some kind of error. But if it goes beyond that, if it goes beyond an error to the point where there was intention and it was theft, then there should be consequences for employers just as there are for employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill is a reasonable balance. This bill closes loopholes that shouldn't be there. In contradiction to what those opposite are saying, it is not going to damage productivity. Productivity isn't a simple matter of reducing costs to employees. That is not what we see in the high-productivity economies of the world. This bill will actually help us move down the productivity journey, but in a way that provides reasonable protection for workers, subject to allowing casual workers, labour force agreements and the gig economy to continue, but in an appropriate way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  The measures in the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 will cost every Australian in one way or another, and it is, in spite of what we've heard, radical change. As we heard the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia, Tania Constable, say at the Minerals Council dinner:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Let's not sugarcoat it. These industrial relations changes are some of the most extreme interventionist workplace changes that have ever been proposed in Australia."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the measures will cost all Australians in one form or another. Already it has been estimated that it will cost Australians at least $9 billion. That's $9 billion, and that's just the first rough calculation. It is extraordinary that the government are quite happy that that's exactly what these laws will do. They've admitted it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are paying increased costs for everyday goods and services that they rely on currently, and we know that the government is intent on making those same Australians pay at least another $9 billion or more. At a time when the cost-of-living, the cost of doing business, energy costs, inflation and staff and housing shortages are such critical issues for Australians, there is no doubt this extra $9 billion—at least, and I think that's the tip of the iceberg—will have detrimental impacts with potential disruptions in the labour market itself, particularly in resource intense states like Western Australia. We have no doubt that there will be major impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the minister can make further changes with a stroke of his pen in at least 32 instances throughout this bill. It concerns me greatly that it will be a legal nightmare for small business owners and employers generally. It is a very incredibly complex bill. You try being that small business trying to make your way through these 800-odd pages and asking, 'How does this affect me and my workplace and my business?' It is complex. It is incredibly complex. It significantly increases red tape, and it is costly in spite of what those opposite think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a direct attack on tradies and other independent contractors on labour hire, the WA resources and mining sector, the gig economy, casual employment as well as casual employees—for instance in the IT area—and the specialists who may have to take a 20 per cent cut in their income as a result of this bill. It's actually an attack on their choices and their employment options that they choose, that are right for them and work for them in that business or sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with casual employment. It inevitably means fewer opportunities, particularly in small to medium businesses, for our young people and for those in rural and regional Australia who rely on these particular jobs. For smaller businesses in particular it means fewer opportunities for older people, who we are trying to get to come back into work and continue to work on terms that suit them as well. It's a two-way street. It certainly will not help employees who specifically want to work and do casual work and get that 25 per cent casual rate. In so many instances in my electorate, I see the impact of the great relationships between employers and employees. It's a mutually beneficial relationship built around what suits both. It's not just a one-way street. It suits both of those parties. Well, there are going to be fewer of those jobs available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will give unprecedented right of entry to the unions to go into businesses, and particularly some of our smaller businesses. These businesses won't have rights when, without notice, the union can arrive on their doorstep. These businesses will have no choice but to do as they're told, and unfortunately I see this as a strategy that embeds conflict in our workplaces where we've currently got employees and employers working together to get done what needs doing and people being remunerated for the work that they do. I meet so many employers who work so closely with their employees and are incredibly grateful that those people work with them, because they cannot achieve for that business without their really good employees, and to have that approach that separates the two is appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that this could also affect the disability sector in regional and rural areas. Again, we're trying desperately to provide the best possible outcomes and support for people in our areas, and we've already got our regional and rural pharmacies really struggling from cuts to their incomes. Now, given that some of these people are the small businesses who employ over 15 people—it's not really clear whether this legislation is just for small businesses under 15 employees or what; it's hard to tell from what's in this—those same businesses who actually employ over 15 people could well now have a union delegate walking into their pharmacies. Many of these small businesses employ so many local people, in flexible arrangements which are designed to suit both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really concerned about the impact this will have on our wonderful small businesses—the courageous people who mortgage their homes just to have a go, the ones who offer other Australians jobs. That's what they do, and this bill treats them almost as if they were the enemy instead of being the people who employ other Australians. They're already so badly affected by the higher and higher costs of doing business, whether it's energy, input costs, inflation, business interest rates or higher insurance premiums, just for a start. These are the same businesses that can't afford a dedicated HR person to go through all of these laws and say, 'What do we have to do as a small business?' Those people don't even know what's hit them yet. I am really concerned for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a small-business employer can't afford to retain all or some of their workers because of measures in this bill, workers will lose their jobs. There isn't a never-ending bucket in these small businesses. Some work on very fine profit margins. I know a number of businesspeople and small-business people who work and pay their employees instead of themselves, so I shake my head at anything that adds to the problems for those businesses. It is really tough in many small businesses right now. They do not need this other layer of complexity and concern right at this moment. As I said, it is not clear at all who in small business will be impacted by what's in this bill. Who will be covered? Who won't be covered?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dairy businesses, employing certain numbers of people who are milking cows and doing all sorts of other jobs on that farm, like rearing calves; vegetables, fruit, horticulture and viticulture small businesses; the cropping and shearing space—these are all the small businesses in rural and regional Australia that could well have the AWU at their gates with no notice, turning up at a farmhouse where the business is run out of the farmer's home. Labor members may not have set foot on a farm and may think that we all have separate offices that we run our businesses out of. No; it's our homes. So a delegate, if he or she has a suspicion—no actual evidence—can actually demand entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delegates will have a virtual proxy law enforcement role where the employer, be they a farmer, a small-business owner or a major employer, doesn't have rights in this space. They can come into our homes and demand to inspect any work, any process or any object. They can interview any person. They can demand to inspect or copy any records or documents, including those on computers, and take samples of goods and substances. In the process, they can subject members of that family to interrogation. And can you imagine the amount of personal information that sits on those computers, given that they're part and parcel of how we operate? Who will have access to this, and what are the responsibilities of those people as to the information they have access to and what they actually do with it? That small-business owner or farmer has no right of refusal or legal representation at that time. I see this as a really gross, ugly invasion and trampling of individual rights in a country that is supposed to be a democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another really serious issue here, because we, the farmers, are clearly targets. Minister Burke said so last week in question time when he actually accused us, the farmers of this country, of wage theft. He also expressed his contempt for the NFF. So, unfortunately, we need to expect that the unions will be knocking on our doors as a result of this. This is coming from a minister who, in this bill, has given himself extraordinary powers. The constant change potential, the uncertainty that that creates for business—I think he can unilaterally and independently change the regulations in at least 32 cases. That happens without parliamentary scrutiny or debate. Who knows what's going to be changed next?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also needs to clarify for our farmers: is it our biosecurity on our properties that we work so hard to protect—we guard it jealously, and what we do is extraordinary—which has priority? Which has priority: our biosecurity and those gates that we have with the notice that says, 'You must contact us before you come on'? Who has rights? What right has priority: that of biosecurity on our property or those who choose to turn up because they have a suspicion that something's happening on our properties? We've seen the threat of foot-and-mouth disease, so I wonder: where does biosecurity sit in relation to this bill when you're talking about farmers? I also have some serious concerns that I'll be closely watching around what happens in the transport and logistics space. I will keep a close eye on what happens here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another sector that will be under the pump will be the building and construction industry, especially, I suspect, residential construction sectors. There are thousands—I think 400,000—contracted independent tradies in that sector. At a time when we're seeing building and construction companies going into administration at a rate we've not seen before in our history, this increases the complexity and cost of construction. I'm already aware of builders in the South West who've historically delivered fixed-price contracts, and they've actually delivered them in spite of the fact that it has cost them to do so. They've had to absorb those additional inflationary costs in their own business, so they're already not making profits. We're going to find out very quickly what 'same job, same pay' actually means in this space and how that interacts with tier 1 and tier 2 type contracts and the current arrangements that exist for delivering major projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a whole lot of different subbies working on various parts of the work at any given time, and they have to come and go because the weather changes. The job itself changes when something doesn't turn up on time or there's a shortage, as we've seen, in the logistics and supply chains. There are any number of hold-ups and changes that have to be made as a project is being built, and flexibility is the absolute key. Labour hire and subbies are necessities on these sites. I think we need to be measuring how much this bill and the measures in it will add to construction costs not just on major projects but also for new homeowners building their first, new or other home and what that will do across the board for the cost of compliance. I think there are some really significant potential impacts from this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've even seen our sporting codes expressing concerns about what it's going to do to the arrangements they have to keep their sporting codes operating. That's just another one that we keep hearing about. I think we certainly need to keep a very close eye on what the numbers are in traineeships and apprenticeships and how the measures in this bill will impact on the decisions that employers will make in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most members in this House, I have some very good businesses in my patch. I think they have a right to be very concerned about the judgements that are being made in this bill—that these businesses are not caring and are not actually providing extraordinary opportunities for the people who work with them and for them, nor the remuneration that those people receive for the work that they do. That relationship between employer and employee is so critical, and anything that interferes with that in a detrimental way should be of concern to everybody in this place. As we see so frequently, when I talk to my employers, especially those who right now can't even get employees, they are desperate. They just need people who can come and work with them and for them. When the employers do find them and they do come and they do their best, the employers are incredibly grateful for that work. They train the employees, and they put time and effort into getting these people to where they need them to be. We need to be fostering that type of relationship in everything that happens in this House, and anything that comes between those relationships is of great concern to me.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  Lucy is a 63-year-old aged-care educator in my electorate who owns a lovely single-fronted terrace with a nice garden, located in Malvern. She walks her dog around the neighbourhood and lives a simple life within her means. In closer discussion she frets, though, about meeting her mortgage repayments, because she has been employed on a casual basis for the past 10 years on recurrent rolling contracts. Without regular work she is at risk of losing her home, something she came close to during the early days of the pandemic when her work dried up. At her age it is not easy to find another job. This is her reward for working her whole life and paying her taxes. If Lucy could go into permanent work she would, but that pathway has evaporated for her. As a result she dips into her super to pay her mortgage when she can't make ends meet, robbing Peter to pay Paul.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our workplace reforms if you are working regular and predictable hours like Lucy and you want to be permanent, you will be able to do so. It will be voluntary, initiated by the worker. No-one will be forced to convert to permanent and lose their casual loading. Employees in medium and large businesses will be able to access permanent work after six months, while those working in small businesses will after 12 months. The worker gains financial security and feels valued, while the business retains an experienced worker. Our society gains by living its values of the fair go while dialling down the vulnerability too many Australians face. This measure will benefit around 850,000 casual workers. Bills aren't casual; they are a certainty, so why shouldn't people working regular hours have the same certainty about their next pay cheque?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Lucy is at the end of her working life, she keeps company with younger people who are part of that growing army of 2.7 million casuals and 320,000 labour hire workers across Australia. These are the truckies who move our goods around from farm to table, those who stack our shelves, the workers who keep residential aged care homes functioning, those who work in childcare centres and those who send us overseas and then bring us back again. We complain bitterly when services are not up to scratch, flights are delayed, bags are late or lost and wait times at call centres blow out, but we do not probe as to why, despite booming profits, customer service is so poor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can accept bumper profits even during tough economic periods, provided that customer service standards are not just upheld but in fact exceeded. When service delivery tanks in the face of bloated corporate profits, Australians see red. The exceptional service Australians rightfully expect is delivered not by robots but by people, and those people have not been treated fairly for some time. It is not uncommon for stewards on the same flight to have different wages or for baggage handlers to be outsourced to labour hire firms who undercut EBAs. It may explain why the customer experience is so variable in Australian airports. Every permutation of flights on time, delayed or cancelled has become the norm rather than the exception. What has emerged in Australia is that large companies have exploited the labour hire loophole to undercut EBAs they've already signed up to. Labour hire workers are brought in at lower pay to perform the same work. It makes a mockery of the EBA process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will give the Fair Work Commission the powers to require labour hire employees be paid at least the wages of the EBA. Some exemptions will apply for small businesses. The explosion of gig workers, some of whom have died in the course of their work, like food delivery workers, is the focus of our minimum standards. Gig workers enjoy their flexibility, but they also want to work free from exploitation and in a safe environment so they can go home rather than to hospital or worse. Low pay drives shortcuts in safety, which can lead to life-limiting choices and consequences. This needs to change. I don't want to live in a society with a growing underclass of working poor; neither do my constituents. I've seen it overseas, where tips pay the bills. It does not align with our values. The mentality of the disposable worker needs to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment will allow the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for gig workers. These minimum standards may cover payment terms, deductions, insurance and cost recovery but not rostering or work health and safety, which falls under other legislation. One of my favourite elements of this bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, is around criminalising wage theft. Wage theft is rampant, and those opposite were complicit in allowing it to take root like a toxic weed. They even cultivated it by taking years to acknowledge the problem and then introducing legislation only to vote down their own legislation in the Senate. They effectively switched on a green flashing light for wage theft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wage theft is criminalised in Victoria and Queensland because they got sick of waiting for the previous government to act. However, we need national consistency on this issue to close this loophole. Heftier penalties will apply, with jail time of up to 10 years and financial penalties calculated in the multiples. The deterrent effect of criminalising wage theft will be profound. It sends a message to employers to tighten up their processes. A class action against a Victorian health network was found in favour of 1,500 junior doctors who had been chronically underpaid their overtime between 2015 and 2021. It was the norm when I went through my early training. We just took it on the chin and took it in our hip pocket, but not this generation. If it's happening to our brightest, then it's happening to many others, and it shouldn't take court action to rectify. We will be criminalising wage theft with a stroke of our pen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously written about work health and safety in health care in the context of breaches during the early days of the pandemic. My research paper called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hearing the voices of Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic</span> had testimony from Australian healthcare workers noting that a few of them actually died from exposure to COVID in the course of their work. These were nurses. Industrial manslaughter is a crime in Victoria, and it is long overdue that it become nationally consistent, again to act as a powerful lever to lift work health and safety standards. Penalties will be $18 million for a body corporate and 25 years for an individual. One hundred and sixty people died at work in 2022. That's 160 too many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be unlawful to discriminate against a worker who has disclosed that they have been subject to family and domestic violence, complementing the 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave that we have already legislated. This acknowledges that domestic violence affects people's cognition—their ability to think, to perform and to be productive. It destabilises them, but it should not result in termination of employment at a time when people need support. When workers are not happy, especially in the service industries, it follows that the customer experience will suffer. The same applies to health care. Doctors and nurses who do not feel valued or respected do not give their best. It is difficult to quantify, but the end result is the same: service delivery suffers. Aged care is no different, and, when a heavily casualised workforce moved between aged-care centres to make ends meet, infection control became the casualty, leading to aged-care outbreaks that were deadly, and these in turn spilt into the community, prolonging lockdowns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health and economic impact of precarious work is real. The chronic erosion of pay and conditions is contributing to inequality, which not only denies workers social mobility but presents a growing threat to societal stability. It is not about having a competitive business sector versus fair work and fair pay for people. You can have both. Indeed Germany has examples of industries where this applies. It is not a zero-sum game. For too long, workers have been seen as a problem to be managed rather than the asset that they are. There are a raft of changes in this bill, but the overall intent is clear: we seek to breathe life and put teeth into our election promise of secure work and better pay. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  When I was a young boy and I had nasty medicine to take, my mother had an interesting ploy. She'd put the disgusting pill on a teaspoon of jam and say, 'Eat it up.' It was a bitter pill to swallow, but the jam was sweet enough that I would take the medicine. I've got to tell you that I think this industrial relations bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, is exactly that. It's a bitter pill wrapped up in a bit of sweet jam. There are a number of things in it that are difficult for anyone to argue against, but there are a whole lot of extra bitter pills that sit within it that will attack dynamism, attack decision-making and attack flexibility in the Australian workforce, and yet those attributes are what we need in Australia at the moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fast-changing world. We have the advent of artificial intelligence and of instant communications, and we all use so many of these applications even on our phones that sit within our pocket, and businesses use them too. But along the way they are getting tied up in red tape. I can't tell you the number of business people I've known—tradies, for instance—that have worked their way up and started to employ people around them. They say, 'I've got six or eight on the workforce.' Next time I run into them, I ask, 'How's it going?' 'Oh, I got rid of them all. Just me now.' 'Why is that?' 'Because I was just working my backside off to fill up their envelopes. They were doing a good job, I was doing a good job, and the company was doing a good job, but I had no life. I was working all week and all weekend. I can earn more money and keep more of my own money by just working on my own.' What a slap in the face for entrepreneurism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this bill. In total there are about 800 pages, with the points of clarity being almost 300 pages in the bill, I think. It was slapped on us at a minute's notice, virtually, in this parliament, and we are now expected to debate it. We've had a little bit longer to look at it now, and of course the longer we have it, the more we look at it and the more bitter pills we find within it. There are those skerricks of jam, like the clauses around family and domestic violence, for instance, which I would have no trouble supporting at all, except they sit within this other structure. Then there's wages theft, and I heard the previous speaker talking about wages theft. Well, wages theft is illegal already. You can't go around stealing other people's property, and in most cases, if it's done with intent, it will be a criminal offence. Somehow things will be said about the opposition, so people like me who see all the nasty things within this bill that I will be compelled to vote against. The government will say, 'Rowan Ramsey, the member for Grey, is in favour of wages theft.' Nothing could be further from the truth, but as I say, with nearly 300 pages of legislation and 500 pages of explanatory notes, no wonder it is a complex bill—it is way over complex. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister really wanted to achieve change he would split them up and we could come at these issues one at a time. But instead he has thrown this great grab bag together, and I am talking about complexity. You look at a businessperson who has seven, eight, 15, even 70 people on the books, and already the Fair Work Act has 1,200 pages. It's no wonder why people sometimes get it wrong when the act is almost impossible to sort through to find out what it is you are meant to be doing. It is a while since I've employed people outside the current job that I have, but even then—and that was 16 years ago—on my farm, I was reading through pages and pages making sure that we got all the employment details right. It's just got worse and worse and worse, and that's why the movers and shakers in our society are saying, 'No more!' The Treasurer said in March that we will be 40 per cent poorer if we don't raise productivity. In a bill that has nearly 300 pages and another 500 pages of explanatory notes, given the subject that the Treasurer is keen to talk about, which is raising productivity in Australia, they can fit in everything else, but they can't fit anything in about productivity. There is not one single thing in this bill that will raise productivity in Australia. In fact, they are just making it harder for us to encourage the dynamism and the innovation that we need. If you wanted to ossify your business sector, if you wanted to ossify our economy, the best thing to do is go down to the supermarket and get yourself a trolley full of red tape. That's what we've got in this bill, a trolley full of red tape. Unsurprisingly, having been duped on tranche 1 of the industrial relations reform, businesses are arcing up, kicking back and saying: 'Enough's enough. If you want us to carry Australia'—and both sides of parliament do want that—'then you need to cut us a break.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course the big ticket here, the really big, bitter pill that sits within this sticky jam, is the right of access for unions, unannounced. Bang, bang on the door, and in they come. All they have to do is suspect that the employer is doing the wrong thing, but they don't actually have to prove that suspicion to anyone. They can just go to the Fair Work Commission and say: 'We suspect that Joe Blow isn't doing the right thing.' 'Why do you suspect that?' 'Oh well, he looks a bit dodgy to me. What do you think?' Then it's bang, bang on the door, and in they come. And that door might be the door to your home. It might be any of our homes. Many businesses are run from home today. So the union jackboots are at your door, just when you're trying to get the kids off to school in the morning. Or they could be out on our farms, bringing weeds onto the farm, threatening biosecurity. We don't know. We don't have the ability to say, before they come into the house: 'Have you washed your hands? Have you washed your feet? Have you been on a farm recently?' These are outrageous interventions into our lives, into our businesses, as people go about their lawful business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Embedded within the bill—and the government has dropped this language now—is the 'same job, same pay' tenet that of course the Minerals Council has led the charge against. The other day I was on a farm property visiting a shearing gang. I've got to tell you that shearing is one of the last industries in Australia where people actually get paid for what they do. They get paid well. A good shearer can probably knock out a thousand bucks a day quite easily. But they get paid for what they do. They work hard. They deserve it. I don't make any bones about it. But imagine, if we started paying shearers by the hour, how many sheep would get shorn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government has already moved in this area, with the fruit-picking industry, and put in minimum rates of pay. When I was a young man, in school, I used to pick fruit. We used to go up the Riverland, where my sister lived, and pick fruit. I was paid piecework there, by the number of apricots that I picked in the day, not for just rolling up in the morning. The fact is that, under these proposals, it's so difficult to actually reward your best workers. We want our best workers to hang around. We don't want to lose them to the mining industry. The way to keep them is to pay them a bit more than the ones that you could probably do without because they're not going quite as fast or efficiently or whatever. But this comes in the way of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another thing that seems to have crept back in here, another one of those bitter pills. Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, I think you would well remember the fight that we had in this place before about the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. I've just been to an event for truckies up in the Dorothy Tangney room. Interestingly enough, it wasn't discussed by the minister up there, and neither were any of these incursions. But the idea that the minister and Fair Work can actually view up and down the pipeline of the trucking industry is a thinly veiled attempt to get rid of the little operators—the ones that have full flexibility because they're driving the trucks with their family, their cousins or whatever, and doing a great job out there—to try and get them run over by the big businesses that will sign the deals to allow the unions in the door. Why would you want that? It all comes back this: that's what funds the Labor Party. No wonder they're in favour of this legislation. That's how they get around. They dress these bitter pills up as being good for the public. One mob it is really good for is the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about gig workers. Sure, everybody should be paid properly for what they do. But one of the reasons that these platforms have workers is that they really, really, really like the flexibility that they offer. Whether they come to work that day or not might depend on other things in their life. They are free to clock on or clock off, to pick up fares or not—as an Uber driver, but that's not the only platform that gig workers use, of course. If we're going to start intervening in that, just who is damaged? You might get a better pay deal for them, but you might get a lot less work, as well. It's a trade-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like I say, there are good things in the legislation. I'm not saying that we don't need to take care of all our workers. After all, as someone who has employed workers for most of their life, the last thing I want to do is lose my good workers. Generally speaking, employers will work to keep good employees and go above and beyond the minimum standard. It's not guaranteed at every level, but to think there are not laws against that already—there are minimum standards in place, through our award system, that mean there is a minimum rate of pay in Australia and it must be paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all of the groups that I'm going to name have been hostile to the government; in fact, on the first tranche, which I was a bit surprised at, they virtually worked with the government to bring in these reforms, but the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group and the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia have come out vehemently opposed to this tranche of industrial reform. That's what the government calls it—reform. I'm not sure that 'reform' is the correct word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see some good in the legislation, but very, very little. I haven't even touched on all of the points that I find offensive within it. I hear giggles coming from the other side there. If anyone thinks this is a laughing matter, they should look at what funds the Australian economy. What are the businesses that the Australian economy runs on? Where does the money to fund all that government expenditure come from? It either comes from companies or it comes from the people that they pay wages to, who contribute back to the economy through their income taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is bad legislation. It has Labor Party fingerprints all over it. It's about paying off their pay masters—the people that fund their campaigns—and I'm totally opposed to it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  I rise to support the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. The bill is about fairness. It's about protecting Australian workers from having their pay undercut. It's about closing loopholes, which will make a life-changing difference for the group of workers that will be supported through these changes. These are reasonable changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we all recognise the changes we're seeing in what work can look like, everyone deserves to work in safe conditions and to earn a decent wage. That is a basic and unobjectionable fact. This legislation delivers on a commitment that our government took to the last election. In fact, we announced it as a policy 2½ years ago, and we have remained steadfast in making sure we see these reasonable and practical changes happen. We promised to get wages moving, and to do that we need to close the loopholes that are undermining the wages and conditions of workers. To that end, this bill makes a series of changes, and particularly I want to highlight three elements of the bill: criminalising wage theft, properly defining 'casual work' so casuals aren't being exploited, and making sure gig workers aren't being ripped off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we've come to government, I know the minister has undertaken extensive consultation on the design of these measures. The government has consulted with business groups, unions, employers, small-business representatives, academics and civil society to make sure we are getting the balance right. While we've been doing all this work, those opposite have called this a made-up issue. Once again, they've demonstrated that they don't care—they are prepared to show disdain for workers and the conditions under which Australian workers have to operate. Regardless of what the other side does or says, our government is prepared to stand up for fair rights for workers. That is what we are doing—standing up for fair rights. We are ensuring that loopholes that undermine job security and wages are closed, because that is the fair, reasonable and right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been some discussion in the community, led by some business groups, attempting to portray the changes that we're making as radical. In fact, these are not radical changes. They are sensible changes that will make a difference for workers and, through them, the families of those workers who have been short-changed by loopholes in the past. Our government is making the current laws work more effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms our government will introduce for gig workers with the passage of this bill will require that workers have some minimum standards, benchmarks, against existing award rates when they are working in a way that is similar to employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage theft reforms will simply strengthen the enforcement of existing rates of pay. This is a good thing. It's a move that I would think most employers out there would welcome because they don't want to be undercut by the bad apples who are doing the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's new definition of casual employment will clarify what was always intended with casual work. If you are working regular and predictable hours and you want to become permanent, that pathway is available to you. These laws will strengthen the current workplace relations system, providing certainty, fairness and a level playing field for workers and for businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the bill includes a number of measures, and I don't propose to go through them all at this stage. But I do want to highlight some of them that I know will be of particular interest to people in my community and, I think, to Australians more widely. The first focuses on criminalising wage theft, introducing a criminal offence for the intentional underpayment of employees' wages and certain entitlements, and increasing the penalties for civil underpayment breaches. This will include a new way for a court to calculate penalties with the inclusion of the value of the underpayment option in situations where that value exceeds the available maximum penalty. At the moment, if a worker steals from the till, it's a criminal offence. But, in many parts of Australia, if an employer steals for a worker's pay packet, it's not. That is not a tenable situation. I would think that anyone here or in our communities would agree that that is simply not fair. Employers who intentionally steal from their workers should face criminal penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that two state Labor governments, Queensland and my home state of Victoria, have already criminalised wage theft. They had to do that because they got sick of waiting for the previous Liberal government to act. As our government looks to making this change, we are mindful, of course, of not inadvertently watering down those wage theft laws which have already been put in place in the states. But we are doing this, we are making this national change, because Australia needs a national wage theft system to make sure we are ending the rip-offs. If passed, this particular set of changes would commence from 1 January 2025. That would allow time for affected agencies to prepare for the new regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of the previous government, I note that, shamefully, during their nine years in office they did nothing to stop the wage theft epidemic—nothing. It took them years to even get to the stage of acknowledging that there might be a problem with wage theft. Eventually, they brought forward some half-hearted legislation that made it pretty clear that they were not interested. And then, when that got to the Senate, they voted against their own legislation. They took their draft law, they tore it up and they threw it away. They couldn't get enough support for their plans because they didn't make sure that they weren't cutting workers' pay and conditions. This sent a clear message to those people, and I don't think there are many of them, who do do the wrong thing—people who were making wage theft a practice. It said, 'That's okay; the federal government is not going to do anything about that.' The message we are sending is clear—that it's not okay. Workers deserve to be paid, and that is an obvious thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do see wage underpayment continuing to feature in Australian workplaces. Obviously, the people who lose from this are workers, and not just the individuals; it is also workers' families and other dependents. Workers are left out of pocket. As I said before, it also forces businesses that are doing the right thing—those businesses who do follow the law—to compete with businesses that are trying to get an unfair advantage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many people will have seen media reporting and coverage of cases of wage theft because it has been extensive. This parliament has considered the issue through several inquiries, including the 2022 Senate inquiry into the unlawful underpayment of employees' remuneration. This is a well-canvassed issue. What hasn't been well canvassed previously is the solution, and that's what this government and this legislation is intended to do. This is a government that is focused on supporting Australians and making sure that people are treated reasonably and fairly, that they are safe and that they are earning a decent wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reform that forms part of this bill relates to the treatment of gig economy workers, also known as employee-like workers. Our government will extend the powers of the Fair Work Commission to include gig forms of work, better protecting people in new forms of work from exploitation and dangerous working conditions. I do accept, as the government does, that the way people work has changed and is changing, that some people do want to work in a flexible way for platforms. The relationships some workers have to employers is different. None of that, however, should be an excuse for poor treatment or underpayment. So under these new laws, the Fair Work Commission will be able to make orders for minimum standards for new forms of work, such as gig work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: we are not trying to turn people into employees when they don't want to be employees. I do understand that some gig workers like the flexibility from using technology, and this won't change under our laws. But we do know that there is a direct link between low rates of pay and safety that leads to situations where workers may have to take risks so that they can get more work because they're struggling to make ends meet. Just because someone is working in the gig economy, doesn't mean they should end up being paid less than they would if they'd been an employee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it really starkly, in some cases what we see at the moment is 19th century conditions with 21st century technology. It's not working. It's not good for workers or for businesses, and I don't think it's good for consumers either. I don't think the people who also want to take advantage of the flexibility of this type of work through the products they're consuming want the people who are delivering those goods and services to them to be underpaid and exploited. We can all agree that the conditions of work should meet today's standards, should meet basic principles when it comes to what is fair and reasonable treatment and pay. We do not want to become a country where you have to rely on tips to make ends meet. That is not the Australian way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gig workers are often engaged as independent contractors, which means under the Fair Work Act they do not receive rights and entitlements. It has been highlighted over time that some of these workers can receive less pay than they would if they were paid under the award safety net, and they have no protections if they lose their work unfairly. So these changes will give the Fair Work Commission a new power to set minimum standards for gig workers performing digital platform work. It will be for the commission to determine if they are mandatory and therefore enforceable with civil penalties or for guidance only. The commission will only be able to set minimum standards for independent contractors who are either performing work as part of the gig economy or have one or more characteristics that are employee-like, such as low bargaining power, low authority over their work or receiving remuneration at or below the rate of comparable employees. The bill will also enable registered organisations representing gig workers to make collective agreements with digital labour platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another measure that will support gig workers is that they'll have new protections from unfair deactivation if they've been working for a digital labour platform on a regular basis for six months. Under the proposed changes, eligible gig workers would be able to apply to the Fair Work Commission to seek a remedy of reinstatement if they consider their deactivation was unfair. Alongside this change, there will be a new digital labour platform deactivation code that sets out clearly the processes that platforms must follow when deactivating a worker—changes that will support workers and provide clarity for platforms. These are good changes, and they are in fact overdue. It is proposed that these changes would commence from 1 July 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reform that forms part of this bill that I want to highlight relates to casual employment. Like the other measures I've spoken about, it's a sensible, commonsense proposal being put forward legislating a fair, objective definition to determine when an employee can be classed as casual. This would close a loophole that currently leaves people stuck as casuals even if in fact they are working permanent, regular hours. It will help to support job security and the benefits that come with that. No-one will be forced to convert from casual to permanent if they don't want to. Some people do in fact prefer to remain casual and to receive the casual loading that comes with that. But for some people there are advantages that come from being a more permanent worker, such as improved access to leave entitlements and more financial security. We know that for many people rent isn't casual. Electricity, gas and water bills aren't casual. Your council rate bill is not casual. School fees aren't casual. Yet for people who are in casual work, the nature of that work can mean they face uncertainty and pressure around meeting a number of those needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will not see a net cost on business. Employers will pay a loading if someone is casual and they will pay leave entitlements if someone is permanent; they do not have to pay both. Again, what our government is aiming to do with these changes is to make sure we are supporting workers, we are supporting their families and we are giving them greater certainty. Again, these are reasonable measures that I know will be welcome in the community because people understand that when we treat our workers well, we all do better. That is good for our community as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will end my remarks where I started them: on the issue of fairness. Fairness is a value that Australians care about deeply. It's one of those things we hold up. We are the country of the fair go. Australia is a fair country. It's part of the fabric of what we consider makes up our country. Well, fairness has to extend to how we treat workers in this country. We do know that for too long loopholes in workplaces have meant that some workers have been let down. They have not been treated fairly. Their wages have been undermined, as have their conditions. They have been forced to work in unsafe conditions. Every worker deserves to work in good and safe conditions. Every worker deserves to earn a decent wage. By making the current laws work more effectively, we can support the segment of workers who have been worse off by casual work, by work in the gig economy and by wage theft. That's why parliament needs to support this bill—because it will make a real difference to these workers' lives and because it will mean that our country lives up to that value of fairness that we like to hold up and extends that fairness across our community to all workers. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299498" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. The Flynn electorate is a large blue-collar electorate consisting of diverse industries such as the mining and resources sector, the agricultural sector, heavy industry and the many small businesses that support these major industries. This proposed bill is incredibly complex and it is an attack on the hardworking family businesses in my electorate. It provides too much uncertainty. It adds additional costs to businesses, especially small businesses. It makes Australians pay more in a cost-of-living crisis. It does nothing to increase productivity. It does nothing to enhance competition. Most worryingly, it risks the jobs of a lot of casual employees. The Albanese Labor government's so-called 'closing loopholes' bill will make life tougher for small businesses by increasing costs, complexity and red tape, and it will likely lead to job losses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will cost employers up to $9 billion in extra wages over the next decade, according to the government's own estimates. Detailed Department of Employment and Workplace Relations costings tabled recently show the changes would cost employers up to $510 million annually, assuming just 66,446 labour hire employees would be covered by the new Fair Work Commission orders. The department also estimated the cost of minimum pay standards for digital platform workers would be $4 billion over the next decade. The department said small businesses would likely be able to pass on extra costs through higher prices for consumers or third-party businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minerals Council claims the $5 billion labour hire estimate is much lower than what actual costs would be for businesses because the economic impact fails to take into account hundreds of thousands of service contractors and workers in related entity businesses captured by this legislation. According to the Queensland Resources Council, in the 2021-22 year, the total economic contribution of the mining and resources sector in my electorate of Flynn produced $17.7 billion of gross regional product. This supports over 50,000 local jobs and produces $9 billion in royalties, which help fund education, roads, health and law and order. We have Australia's largest coal reserves, and 12 operating mines are in the central highlands alone. Mining is the largest employer in the central highlands with a direct workforce exceeding 6,000 people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Master Builders Australia, the Flynn electorate has almost 4,000 small building and construction businesses, the largest number of any electorate across Australia. What will this legislation mean for the people employed in these jobs? Will there be job losses? The Labor government has not explained what will happen. It has no answers. The reality is the changes proposed by this bill are far from 'very modest', as Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations describes them. This is a radical re-ordering of Australian workplace law, and every business organisation in the country has pleaded with the government not to go ahead with it. Minister Burke does not care that the job creators of Australia are telling him that it will be harder to keep people in jobs. This sort of complexity and the costs associated with it will be impossible for small businesses to deal with. This will only add to Australia's cost-of-living crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed to demonstrate how these new laws will make it easier for businesses to employ people, increase productivity, create higher-skilled workforces or raise the standard of living. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has admitted that the new laws will increase costs for consumers for everyday services that they have come to rely on, right in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. We want all Australians to have safe, higher-wage, sustainable jobs and to be rewarded for their hard work and experience. But the employment minister admitted in his speech at the National Press Club that this bill will add complexity to an already unduly complex system and consumer prices will go up. Our workplace relations system is far too complex. Even his 'closing loopholes' tagline is completely disingenuous. It is about reversing decades of history in which Australia has moved away from centralised wage-fixing pay and conditions that are based on productivity and reward for effort. It is about eroding the choice and flexibility of individuals who want to work in their own time on their own terms. It's about putting significant constraints on businesses and employers wanting to expand, construct new projects and infrastructure or simply manage their operations in a way that suits them best. Millions of Australians are already suffering the crippling cost-of-living crisis, and this is of the government's making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to support reforms which will weaken our economy, continue a bad situation and make it worse for Australians and small businesses. Industrial relations reform is without a doubt one of the most important of all economic reforms required to make Australia a more productive and competitive place. The focus of any industrial relations reforms should be to make us more productive and create more jobs. The link with productivity is the key. The more productive we are, the more Australians can be sustainably compensated. Enterprise bargaining should be the cornerstone of our workplace relations system if we are to grow pay packets, improve job security and bolster the flexibility that our employees demand and boost productivity. Australia needs a modern workplace relations system that delivers a safety net for workers, recognises the shared interests of managers and workers in an enterprise success and gives all enterprises the agility they need to compete and succeed. Time is going to cut me off, so I will finish my contribution here and declare that I oppose this bill. It is with grave fear that I say that I think that this legislation will be far, far too complicated for small and medium-sized businesses in my electorate of Flynn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Residents in my electorate of Petrie would have received the biggest survey in their mailbox. It was an electorate-wide mailout of all of my constituents to get a better understanding of what they're thinking when it comes both to local issues as to where we live in South-East Queensland, in Moreton Bay Regional Council and in Brisbane City Council, and also the national issues. It gives me an understanding about what to speak about as your federal MP when I'm here in federal parliament. So I want to thank everyone who returned one. We had thousands of surveys returned both online and through the post, so thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to share some of the things that people actually spoke about in the survey. Across my electorate and those who filled out my survey, it was no surprise that the majority of people are concerned about cost of living as the main priority. It's the absolute No. 1. Lowering people's taxes was the second-highest issue raised with me, followed by strengthening the economy and improving healthcare services. The cost of living was obviously the main one. It was an overwhelming response. Rising electricity prices, crippling housing supply and a lack of infrastructure investment were also of concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On national issues, Rodney Hutchison from Margate wrote that 'the cost of living is through the roof'. Salesh in Bald Hills said, 'Hardworking Australians should be rewarded.' Malcolm Logue in North Lakes wants the government to do more to lower electricity prices. John in Woody Point wants government spending to be decreased to keep more of his taxpayer dollars. Gemma Sinclair in Bridgeman Downs said, 'The housing market is out of control due to insufficient new stock. Government needs to address the supply.' In relation to that, I recently said that, in the last 15 months of the Labor government, they've brought in the same amount of people as the former coalition government did in five years, which is putting massive amounts of stress on housing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has had consecutive interest rate rises since May last year—12, in fact—and it's harder to enter the housing market than ever before. Today in parliament, we had the Leader of the House, Minister Burke, crowing about a $10-a-day increase in wages. He kept repeating '$10 a day' over and over. What he left out, though, is that most people's mortgages have gone up $2,000 a month. Do you know what that works out to a day? That's a $65-a-day increase, and this guy's crowing about a $10 increase in wages. If it's $1,000 a month, it works out at over $30 a day, Minister Burke. So the current government is absolutely failing people when it comes to cost of living. There are higher housing prices, higher rents, higher electricity prices, higher fuel prices and higher food prices all under this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other than cost of living, there are several other national issues that people raise. Peter and Susan Wilkinson in Newport said, 'Protect Australians from Labor's attempt to silence free speech through the misinformation bill.' Robert in Redcliffe wants constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, but he does not support a voice to parliament. Marlene Kuhn in Newport also does not support a voice to parliament. In fact, quite a few people are disengaged on the Voice. They're annoyed that they've got to vote. They're annoyed that the government is raising this at this time and not focusing on the cost-of-living issues that I raised before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kathryn Nielson in Scarborough wants the government to build more dams and investigate all power sources, including small modular emissions-free nuclear power as an alternative. Terry in Deception Bay wants the government to increase manufacturing. Merelyn in Rothwell wants more opportunities for young people finishing school. Darrell Daley in Deception Bay wants national service for school leavers. Not only are national issues important to the people of Petrie but locally, in my electorate, there are issues I want to raise as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gail Holmes in Bald Hills wants Linkfield Road built. The Labor government has slapped this project with bureaucratic red tape, and the minister here in the Albanese Labor government has suspended all of these infrastructure projects under review except those in Labor held seats. People in South-East Queensland are screaming for better infrastructure. We've suffered for years under the Palaszczuk government, and now this minister is kicking the can further down the road.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Recently I became the proud sponsor of the southern brown bandicoot. This all came about from a meeting in my electorate office with the dedicated team from the Australian Conservation Foundation in Adelaide. They included Andrea Rankin, Sharon Hetzel, Anthony Brown, Jenny Cunningham and Richard Bentley. Their commitment to preserving our biodiversity aligns with my own passion for the preservation of our world. It's great to have a picture of the southern brown bandicoot, a national gem, sitting on my desk. It serves as a reminder and a symbol. I look at the southern brown bandicoot and I'm reminded that many other native animals are on the edge of extinction. It reminds me of all my constituents in Adelaide who have raised their voices calling for action and calling for leadership. They are asking for strong environmental laws and accountability, and they are calling on us in this place, as their members, to be responsive and responsible. Unlike the previous government, on this side we listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on behalf of my constituents in Adelaide, I say: zero new extinctions under the watch of our government. That is something the Albanese government will hold themselves accountable for, because our animals, our nature and our world deserve better, and so do our constituents. After years of neglect, our government is taking bold steps to protect our native plants and animals. When we demolish forests, it's not just trees that suffer; the impacts flow through wetlands, reefs, mammals, birds and insects. It's a chain reaction of destruction, and the responsibility rests on all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the world's mammal extinction capital. To overcome this, the Labor government is investing $224.5 million in our Saving Native Species program. This funding supports habitat restoration and the eradication of invasive pests like yellow crazy ants and gamba grass. We've also launched the Threatened Species Action Plan for the next decade, and we are investing $200 million in programs to clean up urban rivers and waterways, which are home to nearly 50 per cent of our threatened animals and 25 per cent of threatened plants. We're not stopping there. We aim to protect 30 per cent of Australia's land and oceans by 2030, preserving vital habitats for our threatened species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying all these efforts is the Nature Positive Plan. We are strengthening environmental laws. We invested $121 million in the recent budget to establish Environment Protection Australia, to help restore trust to a system that badly needs it. This is the new environment protection agency, with powers to decide whether or not developments proceed and to enforce laws designed to protect and restore nature. In addition, we are launching the groundbreaking Nature Repair Market, to empower landholders. The Minister for the Environment and Water has delivered a historic deal for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, including 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. I was proud to be part of that announcement at the River Torrens, in my electorate of Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are serious about protecting the homes of our endangered species, and we have a determined minister, a determined government, leading the way. Together we must shape a tomorrow where life not only survives but thrives. The southern brown bandicoot embodies not just our commitment but our collective resolve to ensure that life in all its forms thrives for generations to come. I encourage everyone in this House to become a proud sponsor of the southern brown bandicoot and everything it stands for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was established by the Liberal-National coalition government to provide federal financial support to Australian councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects. Since 2020 the program has committed $3.25 billion over four phases. The program operates in partnership with local, state and territory governments to deliver services and build facilities which provide long-term benefits and support jobs in local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every local government, in all 151 electorates across Australia, is able to nominate worthy projects for program funding. As an example, I recently attended the opening of the renovated North Beach Soccer Club rooms, which was made possible by $950,000 of funding under this key program. In Moore, the cities of Joondalup and Stirling received $11.75 million and $12.49 million respectively in funding over the four phases, supporting the development of many essential projects for the benefit of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LRCI Program is the most appropriate source of federal funds to support two priority projects in my electorate, namely the redevelopment of facilities at Heathridge Park and the North Shore Community Hub. However, there are concerns that the program is under threat by the Albanese government's cost-cutting measures. I urge the government to continue this program to ensure that federal funding support continues for important local projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The redevelopment of the Heathridge Park precinct in my electorate is a priority project requiring significant funding from all three levels of government. The popular venue is used by over 1,300 local residents for sporting and community purposes. A number of local clubs utilise the aging clubroom facilities, including the Ocean Ridge junior and amateur football clubs, the Ocean Ridge junior and senior cricket clubs, the Ocean Ridge Tennis Club and the local RSL. The current clubhouse buildings are more than 30 years old and inadequate to meet the needs of our growing population. Larger and more modern change rooms, toilets, clubroom and kitchen facilities are required to meet the needs of a growing number of junior and female participants in sports such as women's AFL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Joondalup initiated a needs analysis and feasibility study, confirming the inadequacies of the aging infrastructure as it reaches the end of its asset life. In May, sporting and community groups were left stranded without a venue after heavy rain damaged ceiling tiles at Heathridge Park, forcing its closure for repairs. The city is developing concept design plans and cost estimates for the redevelopment, to be followed by community consultation. The WA state government has committed funding of $2.5 million towards the project, and I call upon the Albanese government to continue the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program to provide federal funding support for this project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important local project in my electorate is the redevelopment of the North Shore Community Hub. The Northshore residential estate in Kallaroo was developed over 40 years ago. At the heart of the suburb is a small community facility built around a clubhouse, including tennis courts and catering for a thriving local community. The facility has long since outgrown its capacity, and the local residents association has prepared a proposal to extend and redevelop the aging facilities. Extensive research has been undertaken to ascertain community needs, culminating in a strategic plan for the next five years, including indicative building plans for the redevelopment of the existing facility. I have been working with the committee members, including Phil Vinciullo, Larry Hirsch, John Ingrams and James Wild, to secure funding for the project. A petition has collected over 1,000 signatures, demonstrating strong local support. A redeveloped North Shore Community Hub will be a valued facility, run by the community for the community. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is the most appropriate mechanism for providing federal funding contributions towards these local projects. I call upon the Albanese government to continue funding this vital program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  Climate change is one of the sharpest security issues facing Australia. Globally, one billion people are at risk of heat stress. That will affect communities around our sunburnt country as well, including in Darwin, where today it is an unseasonal 36 degrees Celsius. The average temperature in September is usually 33. Additional heat, causing marine heatwaves, is likely to lead to a 45 per cent reduction in marine productivity; devastating sea level rises, which are an existential risk for our Pacific island neighbours; and serious losses to fisheries, tourism, agriculture and other sectors of our economy, not to mention longer droughts and harsher fire seasons. I'm thinking of all the firefighters fighting a massive fire in the Northern Territory at the moment. It's four times the size of the ACT. It isn't the future that I'm speaking of. As the fires in the Territory show, these effects are being felt today. They will also have national security implications, like the risk of climate change induced irregular migration. That's a billion people are experiencing heat stress. Some of them are going to be on the move. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's one of the many reasons why the energy transition to net zero by 2050 is so central to Australia's national interest. Territorians are already playing their part. About one-third of Australian households have solar panels on their roofs, in fact setting a world record, and Territorians are also transitioning to solar at record rates. A total of 22,228 small-scale systems were installed by early 2023 this year, with a total capacity of around 174 megawatts. This adds up to about 695 watts of solar power per Territorian. That's impressive considering how much more expensive solar systems are in Darwin than the average price around the nation. We're adding another 35 megawatts with the Darwin-Katherine battery energy storage system that is being tested. Its 192 batteries will increase solar uptake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Territory is also fortunate to host the world's biggest renewable energy project, SunCable. It will generate a massive 17 to 20 gigawatts, delivering 3.2 gigawatts of firm power. This project will be incredibly important to Darwin in terms of renewable power generation, as well as to our key strategic partner, Singapore, by partially powering that country's grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable electricity is critical to the energy transition. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that the share of total electricity must double, electrifying transport and heat, to meet our global target. That's also true of the Territory's own target of reaching 50 per cent renewable energy electricity consumption by 2030. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is another important energy source abundant in the Northern Territory that will be central to this transition, which is why projects like the Beetaloo basin are of not only local but national and global importance. The Beetaloo basin is estimated to contain 500 trillion cubic feet of gas. Developing the Beetaloo basin would not only create 13,000 jobs but also increase economic activity in the Territory by $17 billion. It would deliver cheaper and more reliable gas across Australia for decades to come, spurring advanced manufacturing and low-emissions industries in the Northern Territory and bolstering the much-needed transition fuel that is gas for our own energy mix as well as that of our trading partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct is another important project that will help drive the energy transition by attracting hydrogen, carbon capture, gas, critical minerals processing, advanced manufacturing and other industries to the Top End.

The Territory is rich in 15 of these and in ultravaluable rare earths, with nine active and prospective mining projects. If we get this right, the global energy transition is full of economic, social and security benefits for Australia, and Territorians are ready to support this national mission.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Tonight, I want to talk about the Voice referendum, which will be held in less than five weeks. I'm concerned about a few things. I'm concerned about the unfair playing field that the Albanese government has created in setting the rules of this referendum, rules that favour the 'yes' side. The truth is that the Prime Minister has made a mockery of this whole process. He's taken a lot of shortcuts, trashing convention along the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no constitutional convention. There was no attempt to build unity on an amendment that would have recognised Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in our Constitution. The parliamentary committee process was cut short. There have been no official 'yes' or 'no' campaigns so that all Australians can access and consider the competing arguments. Instead, it's been division and wedge politics from the start. Labor have stacked the deck for the 'yes' campaign at every turn, and, sadly, the Prime Minister has divided us as a country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he hasn't done it alone. He's done it with the big end of town. Big business, big tech, big sport and big finance have all stood with the Prime Minister. 'Yes' enjoys huge financial, cultural, political and economic power in this debate, including free flights from Qantas and big dollars from big business—BHP, $2 million; Rio Tinto, $2 million; Wesfarmers, $2 million—along with support from Woodside Energy, National Australia Bank, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Woolworths, Coles, Telstra and so on. The Prime Minister refused to grant equal public funding for each side of the referendum because he knew he could count on big money flocking to the 'yes' campaign, and they sure are delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with big business and big finance, big sport is backing the Prime Minister's divisive Voice campaign. Every major sporting code is on the 'yes' ticket, and big tech like Facebook run a form of soft censorship with their underhanded RMIT fact-checking operation.</span>

Tonight I'm giving Peter from Queensland a voice inside this chamber. Peter sent me an email last week, and I think he speaks for many Australians out there: those who love their country but who don't have the money or the power or the access like those in the 'yes' campaign.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  I wanted to make one comment on the previous contribution before I speak about my topic tonight. Yes, we cannot change the past, but we can all change the future, and that's what excites me the most about this Voice referendum and the opportunity that we all have as Australians to come together and to change the future. That is what the Uluru Statement from the Heart was about, and that was the gesture that they extended to not just us in this place but all Australians. We can come together to change the future so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I wanted to do tonight was to stop for a moment and say to all the parliamentarians, particularly on the government side and the crossbench: it's a good day; we've done a good job. To learn through question time that a deal has been struck on major housing reform is so welcome. We have been able to come together as a parliament and find a way through our differences to agree on supporting the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say, 'Good job,' because I know it will make a difference to people in my electorate over the long term. We, like the rest of Australia, are in a housing crisis locally. It's not a housing crisis that started just a year ago, or even a few years ago; it was a generation in the making, when a previous government in this place made a decision to stop investing in social and community housing and alter the way that federal governments and, therefore, this parliament are engaged in housing policy. I am talking about the John Howard years. I raise that because it relates to what I have spoken about with people in my electorate recently. One of the pillars of the Howard era was this focus on the private rental market, the mum-and-dad investors. What I have learnt is that policy has only really lived a generation. A lot of people who jumped in and took advantage of that generous policy towards them did make some wealth and did acquire an asset—usually only one or possibly two housing assets—but they have since passed, or are going into aged care, or are selling up to split that asset amongst their children, so it is having an impact on local rental markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big piece of feedback from my community—I've met with real estates in my electorate as well as a number of social and housing community providers—is that there was big agreement that it cannot be left up to the private rental market alone to deliver all of the housing that's required. There needs to be a government supported and funded social and community housing safety network that provides houses for people who are vulnerable, for people who are not suited to the private rental market. I am talking about some people with profound disabilities. I think we do put a lot of pressure on our private rental market and property managers—it might be their first job out of school—to manage property for people who might have complex mental health issues such that receiving a letter from a real estate agent could be a trigger. That isn't fair and it isn't appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I really welcome about what we've done today is that we have found a way through. We've found a policy that can get the federal government back on track and working with the state and local governments and the community housing sector to build the social and community housing that we need. I want to say to all of the people in my electorate that I know this isn't going to happen immediately. I think about Stephanie, who has been protesting out the front of my office about this very issue. She is one of the many people who have found themselves homeless in the last few weeks, months or a year for some. She is frustrated and desperate. She is living in a makeshift camp at the back of the Bendigo showgrounds. We have people living in the forest these days. People haven't lived in the forest because of homelessness for decades. People are living in unsafe areas. This will help in the long run; it won't help in the short term, but we do hope it will start to deliver a long-term change to the situation we have in this country.</span>

It's a hard job, and we understand in this parliament how hard it is. We need to recognise the work that you do. We need to acknowledge those who have given up their lives for our communities; we have seen, tragically, three more lives given up this year. We recognise the camaraderie, the work that you do, and, importantly, how difficult it is. We as a parliament would like to thank you. Know that you have our support right here in Canberra.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  Being the community Independent for Goldstein has given me the most wonderful opportunities to meet with the many fabulous community organisations in my electorate. One that many of us will be aware of is the Australian Men's Shed group, which visited the parliament last week to mark 30 years of sheds. The modern men's shed is an updated version of the shed in the backyard that's long been a part of Australian culture. It's a place where men from all walks of life meet, sometimes for a cuppa, always for company, and where they can use their skills to support their community and one another and to learn new skills. Sheds help improve men's health and social connections and do wonderful work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've recently had the absolute pleasure of connecting with two men's sheds in Goldstein—Bayside Men's Shed in Beaumaris and Brighton Men's Shed just down the road from my electorate office. Members of the two sheds have very kindly created props for me to use when I visit schools to deliver mock parliaments. The Parliamentary Education Office is an incredible asset for MPs and my team, and I often use many of their resources. For example, the office provides templates for items found in the chamber like the Speaker's mace and the dispatch box. Brighton Men's Shed created a beautiful dispatch box from the template, and in July I was welcomed for morning tea as they presented me with the timber box. It was a morning of great discussion and connection, and I thank all the men for such a warm visit. Bayside Men's Shed produced a beautiful replica of the Speaker's mace, and I was honoured to be invited to speak as their guest last month and enjoyed meeting members over a barbecue lunch. They are a wonderful group of caring men engaged with their community, and I thank them immensely for the hospitality shown to me and Lerna from my team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both these props were recently used in two Goldstein youth forums—one with grade 6 students from schools across Goldstein and the second in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for year 10 students. It was great fun to be walked into the chamber acting as Speaker, with my electorate officer, Lerna, brandishing our own Speaker's mace as the Serjeant-at-Arms—an experience made all the better for all involved.</span>

The foundation's mission, to end avoidable blindness, is being actualised in more than 25 countries, including Australia's own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July I visited the foundation's groundbreaking clinic in the Solomon Islands, delivered in partnership with the Australian government. There I was profoundly moved by the 'patch off' moment, witnessing a patient see clearly for the first time post-surgery. This impactful visit reminded me that the remarkable generosity of my constituents in Bean is making a global difference. We have more than 5,000 donors here who have contributed a staggering $5.73 million to The Fred Hollows Foundation. This is more than financial support; it's a catalyst for transformative action. Just $25 can fund a life-changing eye surgery abroad, while here at home the foundation is making important strides in Indigenous eye health. Remarkably they've halved the rate of blindness among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The donations from Bean constituents are tangible acts of compassion, funding surgeries, providing antibiotics and supporting community health workers. Together we're realising Fred Hollows's vision of a world without avoidable blindness. To those generous donors in Bean, thank you for your steadfast support. Let's continue to drive change and uphold human dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we recognised National Threatened Species Day, marking 87 years since Australia's last Tasmanian tiger went extinct. Australia is home to between 600,000 and 700,000 species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. In the ACT and Bean, as part of our threatened species action plan, the Albanese government has worked diligently to protect threatened species such as the Canberra grassland earless dragon, the swift parrot and the eastern quoll. Last week, some in this chamber may have met some of my furry constituents who visited the House. Earlier this year I partnered with the Conservation Council ACT Region's Bush Buds program to promote local threatened species, where I chose the gang-gang cockatoo to be my bush bud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can all do our part to protect our threatened species—ensuring we are responsible cat owners, for example, or volunteering at a local community organisation. We should all be working together to do what we can in this place and outside this place to reverse these trends and end mass extinctions, like what happened with the Tasmanian tiger.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  The Australian Greek community is one of the great migrant multicultural success stories of all of the migration waves that we have seen in Australian history. I want to pay tribute to the Hellenic Orthodox parish and the community of Parramatta. I had the great pleasure to attend the 2023 Let's Go Greek Festival. There were about 10,000 people there, and about 30,000 throughout the whole day attended from all across Sydney to celebrate Greek and Hellenic culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this great family festival, the Let's Go Greek Festival, is the Greek Orthodox parish of Saint Ioannis. Father Dimitri is a great parish priest down there in Parramatta. It's a church which has built itself in the heart of what is the modern, multicultural metropolis of Parramatta.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great day because you have this wonderful piece of land where a convict of Greek heritage, who was one of the original inhabitants, used to farm. There you have the Aboriginal meeting place—the Parramatta River—with plenty of eels in the river. You've got the modern metropolis, which the modern, multicultural city of Parramatta represents. Just down the road you have the governor's seat, which was the centre of the modern Australian colony for a hundred years at Parramatta. It's a great summary of modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greek community there do such a great job of working for other people. The Greek Orthodox parish helps so many people through its charity and other programs. It also brings together the great cultural celebration of what Greeks have brought to Australia—that is: working so hard, building so many small businesses, building family businesses and integrating so successfully into a modern and diverse city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate all of the committee involved in that: Kos Dimitriou, who's the president of the Hellenic Orthodox Community at Parramatta &amp; Districts and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia Inter-Communities Council of New South Wales; his Grace and Eminence Archbishop Makarios of Australia, who I had the pleasure of working with during the pandemic; his Grace Bishop Iakovos; and Father Dimitri, a fantastic parish priest who works very hard with the community there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pleasure to speak with the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Speakman; many of the local members; and the Lord Mayor of Parramatta, Sameer Pandey, about the contribution of the community and to thank them for all their work over many, many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have some needs, in relation to developing some of their land to provide support to the community, that I know the Parramatta Council will play close attention to. It would be great to get a modern Greek Orthodox church built. I know the council will look upon that favourably. It would be great to have a functioning car park. I asked the Labor-Greens council not to have an ideological opposition to car parks in a modern, major city where we have a lot of cars coming and going. It would be great to have their support for such a great community based project as well. I say to the community: thank you for all the work you do. Thank you for the great contribution you're making to a modern Parramatta. It was great pleasure to be there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  Over my long period of public service in the Northern Territory I've seen many federal governments come and go. Many have purported to care for, and have a focus on, the Territory. Former governments, particularly those on the conservative side, have spoken strong words when it comes to the Territory, but they've had very little appetite for the policy grunt and nuance required to address systemic and persistent changes. It is easy to get stories about Territory disadvantage on the front page of media outlets; it is much harder to develop and implement solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak about what's different about the Albanese government. Our government is embarking on policy correction for the Territory. It is not an easy one, but after decades of neglect it is a necessary one. We are reforming the CDEP, or Community Development Employment Project; bringing jobs back to the bush; and supporting local communities, particularly in my electorate of Lingiari, to drive economic development and enterprise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are reforming the EPBC Act, working to establish a water trigger, thus protecting the most vital resource in the Territory. We are investing heavily in social infrastructure, in Freds Pass and the Katherine pool; upgrading campgrounds; resurfacing netball courts; and building new facilities and infrastructure in Alice Springs. We are investing heavily in Central Australia. Central Australia has long been left behind, with insufficient investment even in comparison to other communities in the Territory. Our record investment in Central Australia will see major upgrades to infrastructure and a boost in funding for youth engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, for FASD, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, we are implementing assessments. We are providing critical housing for women and children fleeing domestic violence, improved security for Alice Springs and long-overdue support for our Centralian schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work is being driven by and advised on by the Aboriginal Leadership Group, supported by our local regional controller, Dorrelle Anderson, who is doing a fantastic job. This means policy is not determined in Canberra but by listening to people on the ground. For the first time in a long time, those members—Les Turner, Josie Douglas, Graeme Smith, our all-important grandmothers group and many more—are listening and acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not without its challenges, but finally it's supported by a federal government willing to tackle the enduring issues that we have been facing, issues which are intractable and often have been thrown to the curb side because they've been too hard to deal with. Finally, we're getting and working towards the many solutions that certainly Alice Springs and Central Australia has needed for a long time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  Recently I held an afternoon tea in my Penrith electorate office to talk to local families who have a family member with type 1 diabetes. The Mayo Clinic says: 'Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition.' We know this is when the pancreas stops producing insulin so the person has to be reliant on insulin for the rest of their life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost a year ago, my oldest son, Byron, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes after suffering from COVID. As the deputy chair of the House's Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, we recently had an inquiry into long COVID. Throughout the cycle of the inquiry and afterwards, emerging data was presented demonstrating the rapid rise of type 1 diabetes, specifically in those who recently acquired COVID-19. There has been research that taken place around the world, and this is showing a huge spike in type 1 globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the work of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for their incredible advocacy in this space. The majority of families who attended the afternoon tea at my office were connected with JDRF and were keen to share their stories and how different medical devices are now assisting people to live pretty much normal lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also spoke about a Fiasp, which is a fast-acting insulin that the Albanese Labor government is about to boot off the PBS. I have been running a campaign to save Fiasp, because there are around 15,000 families across Australia who rely on it. It's actually a life-saving insulin. Kids, who may have not been able to play sport because they couldn't control their blood sugar levels, can take Fiasp as it acts really fast, and then they can get back out on the field or doing whatever they love. They can be pretty much like a normal kid. So it is extraordinary that the Labor government is not trying to find an urgent solution to this problem that is impacting the lives of kids and adults with type 1 across Australia. It is extraordinary that they are going backwards when it comes to type 1 diabetes management and will force those who cannot afford Fiasp without PBS support to have to look for another insulin product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my type 1 diabetes family to those in Lindsay and right across the country, I will keep up the fight for Fiasp, because we can't go backwards. We have to support our young people in particular who do have type 1 diabetes to make it affordable and accessible to all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  When it comes to installing rooftop solar, Australians are world champions. Almost a third of Australian households have rooftop solar—the highest rate in the world. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, rooftop solar accounted for 7.9 per cent of total generation in quarter 2 of this year. That's more than gas and nearly equal to hydro. There's potential for rooftop solar to be an energy powerhouse, but that potential is not being realised at the moment. Only one in 60 households have battery storage, because household battery storage is still too expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While doorknocking in Concord last year, I met a resident who had installed a household Tesla battery. He no longer used energy from the grid, because he was wholly reliant on energy created by his solar panels and stored in his battery. So, instead of having to pay for electricity, he was able to make a little money by selling excess energy he was creating from his solar panels into the grid. Also, because he did not rely on the grid, he had the added advantage of avoiding blackouts the neighbourhood had experienced. However, he estimated he wouldn't recoup the cost of the battery for several years, but he felt it was a good investment because his home was more sustainable and energy efficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get to 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, which is the Albanese Labor government's target, we will need battery storage at an industrial and household scale, but we'll also need it at the community level. That's why I'm so proud of the Albanese government's Community Batteries for Household Solar Program. We are delivering on an election commitment to 400 community batteries providing storage of cleaner, cheaper renewable energy for households, and I am delighted that the first community battery installed under this scheme was in Cabarita in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many benefits of community batteries. They empower residents to harness affordable solar energy during the day and store it for use in the local grid when the sun isn't shining. Community batteries give more people, including those unable to install solar panels, such as renters and apartment owners, access to renewable, cheaper energy. Having storage close to generation makes the energy network more efficient. It helps get more capacity out of existing poles and wires. I want to thank all the groups that have worked so hard to advocate for renewable energy in our community: Climate Action Burwood-Canada Bay, Inner West Community Energy and Inner West Community Battery.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  Sport and the connection that it provides are important in a young person's life. Less than a decade out from the Brisbane Olympics, the Queensland Labor government has slashed funding to grassroots sporting organisations. I'll continue to advocate for sporting clubs in Petrie, including to support the work of three great sporting clubs in the electorate: the Redcliffe Tigers AFC, Aussie rules; Padres Baseball Club, which includes softball; and Peninsula Power football club, or soccer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Redcliffe Tigers AFC, which had its youth presentation over the weekend, is a rapidly growing club. I want to congratulate rising star Allyson Hay on her achievement, along with the other boys and girls who have had a great season. Ninety per cent of players are local. The Redcliffe Tigers AFL club have been working hard behind the scenes to develop plans to upgrade their current facilities to accommodate their growing needs, especially for female teams. I promised funding under a re-elected coalition government at the 2022 election to deliver much-needed women's change room facilities. Labor promised nothing. A commitment of $1 million would enable the Moreton Bay city council to deliver the change rooms sooner, supporting women's sport. I asked for support by the signing of a petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Padres Baseball Club, currently in their preseason, are looking out for juniors and seniors wanting to join the club across their baseball and softball programs. The programs are growing rapidly, and they also need an upgrade. A million-dollar commitment from the federal government would include the demolition of the existing softball clubhouse, a concept plan estimate, and the design and construction of new district-level clubhouses, amenities, first aid offices, internal storage and food and beverage rooms that would give them an income-producing asset. That could be delivered through the council as well. We've already put a lot of money into this club in the past, including from the former federal coalition government and the Moreton Bay city council to upgrade lighting, but more needs to be done, so I would ask you to sign my petition for the Padres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Peninsula Power football club is a force to be reckoned with in the region, with many teams currently playing in the finals. The men's over-45s, with my name as a sponsor, recently won, which was great. It is important that we secure facilities for Peninsula Power as well. We've previously upgraded their sporting clubhouse at AJ Kelly Park, but there is more to do. They need a lighting upgrade as well, because I think they'll make it to the A-League one day. They're that sort of club. They're the strongest in the region and ranked very highly throughout the country. Thank you to all the volunteers at Peninsula Power for what you do. In the lead-up to the Olympics and with the success of the Matildas, who came fourth in the World Cup recently, more people will join football, so I'll keep advocating for those three clubs.</span>

Werriwa is home to almost every language, religion and culture on earth. One of the greatest pleasures of my role is supporting these communities and cultures in their celebrations. I recently attended one such celebration: the gala dinner to mark the 35th Serbian Folkloric Festival. The festival, which began in 1987, is a two-day celebration of Serbian culture. It brings together all generations celebrating the dance, song and food of Serbia. Also in attendance was His Excellency Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Serbia to the Commonwealth of Australia Mr. Rade Stefanovic. I commend the organisers of the night. The event was a tremendous occasion, and I look forward to celebrating the contribution that the Serbian community makes not only in Werriwa but in the wider Australian community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Liverpool and District Historical Society held the Ward and Olive Havard Memorial Lecture recently. The society is one of our local community's most important organisations. It is dedicated to the preservation of the history of Liverpool and its surrounds. Unfortunately, as with many areas, so much of our history has been lost or forgotten in the name of progress. The commitment of the hardworking volunteers ensures our history is acknowledged, celebrated and conserved. I acknowledge the leadership of the secretary, Gail Newman, and the president, Glen Op Den Brouw. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lecture was delivered by Mrs June Young OAM, who has been the face of Liverpool's charitable and civic events for longer than I remember. Her hard work, dedication and drive to help those in need, charities and others is legendary. I have watched firsthand the positive impact she has on our local community. June has been a resident of the Liverpool area for over 50 years. Her service is far-reaching, both within and outside our community. June has had extensive involvement in Quota International and Rotary, two organisations that have been driven by a shared goal of eliminating poverty and helping those in need. Closer to home, Mrs Young is involved in the Sheppard Centre, Miracle Babies, the Cancer Council, the Autistic Advisory Committee, National Council of Women NSW and Fairfield RSL. And this list is by no means exhaustive. Her involvement in so many organisations over the years stems from a single motivation. Thank you, June, for all you have done for our community. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I rise to congratulate the Margaret River Discovery Co and its owner, Sean Blocksidge. They recently won a very prestigious Trip Advisor traveller's choice best of the best award. This is a fantastic award for Sean. Trip Advisor recently revealed the best of the best things to do around the world, with Margaret River Discovery Co making the top five things to do in the whole of the South Pacific region. That is a fantastic achievement. It's no mean feat—when you consider the opposition and some of the wonderful tourism opportunities out there around Australia and the South Pacific—to come up in the top five in the whole of the South Pacific region. Congratulations, Sean. I think you're doing a fabulous job and, obviously, so do many other people. They're supporting you directly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret River Discovery Co. is only one of two experiences in WA that made the top 10 list. That's how outstanding it is and how outstanding what Sean's doing is. They are actually ahead of swimming with whale sharks in Exmouth, so that's no mean feat. Sean calls Margaret River his 'paradise on earth', given that he's come from a city background. His tours have been consistently rated No. 1 in things to do in Australia on the website for the past two years and have been awarded Margaret River region's No. 1 tour experience for the 16th year in a row. No wonder it is voted as one of the best experiences in the whole of the South Pacific region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is actually described, very cleverly and rightly, as a 'tour for people who don't do tours'. So it's an experience that stands out that actually encourages people to go along, whether for wine and nature lovers or off the beaten track—literally off the beaten track—to show them some of the hidden experiences of the region while, at the same time, enjoying some of the fabulous wine and food that we have in the Margaret River region. It's perfect for those who like a bit of adventure and a lot of fun, whether that's canoeing, going to the beach or local tastings. They will always go to a wonderful venue to enjoy the fabulous food. There's a luxury four-wheel drive adventure and walk along the Wilyabrup Cliffs, which is a spectacular part of the Cape to Cape track. What's not to like about this? No wonder this is one of the best experiences in the South Pacific. Congratulations, Sean. What a fabulous achievement! I hope people keep coming.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  There is a tidal wave of support for the Voice in my community, and I could not be more proud. On Friday, I had the privilege of participating in a diversity panel with the amazing elders, Carol Innes and Oral McGuire. They are smart, kind and fierce. It was a very moving panel. It was an amazing experience where everyone in the room wanted this to happen, but not only do we want this to happen, we want to step up and help make this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, I went doorknocking in Cannington. Many first-time doorknockers wanted to step up and help their community get the word out. I want to give a special shout-out to Mitch and Andrew, the first-time doorknockers I went with. On Sunday, before I jumped on a plane to come to Canberra, I went to the Vic Park farmers markets. Again, my community there had a sea of 'vote yes' corflutes. Fifty people were rocking up to the markets to collect their corflute signs because it was a message of positivity and hope. It was great to see councillors Jesvin Karimi, Bronwyn Ife and Wilfred Hendriks and community members David, Linda and Leandro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The support doesn't stop there. There is a wall of community organisations, and, every Friday, we've been sharing information with people coming up to the wall of support for Swan. There's the Vic Park Raiders Football Club, the Charter Work Drinks, the Southern Chronicles, Hugo Jorge: Counselling and Coaching, the Eclectic Squirrels, Star Street Uniting Church, Swan Districts Football Club, Curtin University, BHP, Rio Tinto, Westpac, Coles, Woolworths, NAB, the Transport Workers Union, Wanslea, Communicare, Mission Australia and the great AFL team, the West Coast Eagles Football Club.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do all these organisations have in common? It would be difficult to pick out one trait. Some are large corporations, some are small corporations, and some are owner led businesses, from religion to sport. They have two things in common. The first is that they all operate in my electorate. The second one is that they're willing to step up and shape our nation for the positive, one that will place our nation on the right side of history and one that will unite our nation. They are organisations that are united by one pledge—a pledge to do better. It is a pledge to do better for our First Nations people and to recognise First Nations people in the Constitution and to do that in a meaningful way by giving them a voice to parliament. We are voting yes! I don't have time to name them all today, but I will say that the wall of support shows the enormous amount of support for the 'yes' vote in the electorate of Swan. I could not be prouder.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am moving this important private members motion because I am still in shock about the devastating childhood cancer that causes more deaths in our precious young Australians than any other disease. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, is a brain tumour with no treatment and a 100 per cent mortality rate. Patients typically survive a matter of months following diagnosis. One child develops this dreadful disease every two weeks. Just 10 per cent of patients survive two years, and less than one per cent survive five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month I met with Beau and Terry Kemp who told me of their harrowing story of losing their beautiful son, Ryley, at just eight years of age. Their story is heartbreaking and, sadly, not unique. When I met with the Kemps, I also met with Professor Matt Dun. Matt is a medical biochemist. He is Professor of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Research in the University of Newcastle, Australia, and a deputy director of the Hunter Medical Research Institute Precision Medicine Research Program. Matt is also the founder and director of RUN DIPG, a charity dedicated to improving outcomes for patients impacted by this awful disease and their families. Matt lost his own daughter to DIPG in 2018, and I'm sure it feels like yesterday for Matt and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a folder on my desk full of stories from other DIPG families. As a parent and grandparent, I find they are incredibly hard to read and impossible to read without tears. Matt told me that, when his daughter was diagnosed, he and his wife were told, 'Go home and make memories.' Imagine being told that about your child. Matt is committed to researching this disease until that advice is no longer the standard line given to families. That research requires investment. The previous coalition government invested $970,000 in medical research for DIPG, but there has been no direct federal government funding since then. By comparison, leukaemia research has received $140 million since 2014, and you need only look at the survival rates of children with that disease and how they have improved over the years to know how essential investment in research is. RUN DIPG have asked for just $10 million from Australia's $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, while the Kids Cancer Centre at the Sydney Children's Hospital estimates that an injection of $25 million specific to DIPG research is needed. They are hoping for recurrent funding until mortality rates improve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is already recognised as a world leader in DIPG research. A miracle is needed, and research investment is the key. In this chamber, we must make every effort to ensure that there is hope and that miracles can begin to occur. I am committed to supporting these wonderful parents, and I call on the health minister, Mark Butler, to do the same. As yet, he has not met with DIPG advocates, despite their many requests. I wrote to Minister Butler after meeting the Kemps, urging him to activate funding under the MRFF for DIPG. The minister did not even have the grace to respond directly; a reply was given by his chief of staff. The response did nothing to address the need for direct research into DIPG. The minister's chief of staff advised that there is an open and competitive grant opportunity where RUN DIPG could partner with other brain cancer researchers, yet we all know that the minister could activate discretionary funding. The funding sought by RUN DIPG and the Kids Cancer Centre would, relatively speaking, be a drop in the ocean. These parents need hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have put up this motion today because we are charged as representatives in this great parliament with shaping positive outcomes for all Australians. I am heartened to hear, on the day I'm moving this motion, that Minister Butler is at last scheduled to meet with RUN DIPG this week. As we approach Childhood Brain Cancer Awareness Day on 26 September, I hope the minister commits to funding this vital research.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I'd like to thank my colleague for raising this important private member's motion. In the course of my career as a medical practitioner, I often had to break bad news. It was never easy, and it was an almost daily event. Of course, in my practice, that breaking of bad news was for adult patients and their families, and it would often occur in the context of finding a small room, often no bigger than a broom closet, sitting people down with a box of tissues and telling them what was going to happen—if I was lucky. Very often, it would happen in the halls of a busy hospital in the corridors, holding up the walls essentially, as people went by and alarms were buzzing—completely suboptimal. On no occasion were those conversations easy, I must say. But I've got to say that in many cases there was a glimmer of hope, because, when adults get cancers, there are often treatments and survival is not an unreasonable prospect to give people—the exception being when the cancer is just too far gone and has spread. I can only imagine how much harder this conversation must be for families and the parents of children who develop cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brain cancer is a shocking disease. There are about 1,900 cases of brain cancer in Australia. Of that 1,900, 120 cancers affect children. The five-year survival rate overall from brain cancer has really not shifted much in the last 30 years. It sits at around 20 per cent for the whole cohort, adults and children. However, within the group of childhood brain cancers, there is one particular cancer, DIPG, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, which has also been renamed diffuse midline glioma, that has a zero survival rate. There are very, very few cancers that, hand on heart, are this aggressive. It is a hypervirulent and hypermalignant tumour. It robs children of their movement and their ability to coordinate. It robs them of their basic functions, the ability to swallow, to speak and to move their eyes, which means communication becomes almost impossible in the terminal stages of their lives. It also affects their basic automatic functions, like breathing, blood pressure, heart rate and sleep. In effect, these children become locked in, because their higher functions, their consciousness, are still in operation. It is an awful, awful disease. It is aggressive. It starts in the brain stem and then it spreads throughout the brain, up and down the brain stem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DIPG, as I have said, is a high-grade malignancy, and in terms of treatment it is largely palliative. It is radiotherapy. But that only extends life for a short period of time until the inevitable occurs. The reason brain cancers are so hard to manage is that the brain is considered a sanctuary site. It is protected by a blood-brain barrier, and it's actually very difficult for drugs to get through this barrier to the target site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is clear is that we need much better research in this field, and I am with my colleague in saying that when you're faced with something of this magnitude, with such terrible outcomes, the only pathway forward is through research. I was reading about Levi's Project, a project brought forward by two parents, Ben and Kath, in tribute of their eight-year-old son, Levi, who died in 2019 of DIPG. This family, through their grief, mobilised and have raised over $4 million towards brain cancer research. There is currently an immunotherapy trial, called the CAR T immunotherapy trial, being run out of Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, which is available to all children in Australia. We need efforts like this to be multiplied many times over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that our government has contributed $136.6 million towards the Australian Brain Cancer Mission to support research into brain cancer. This is on top of initiatives such as the $100 million Zero Childhood Cancer program, $100 million to establish the Children's Comprehensive Cancer Centre and $750 million which has gone towards clinical trials, largely in rare diseases and rare cancers, where we desperately need more guidance as clinicians. There is much more to do. We realise that this is also something that governments of both persuasions must invest in for the long term, because research is the long game. It can often take many decades before it yields outcomes, but we must stay the course.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for bringing this important motion to the House. I too acknowledge the need to invest more into diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. I acknowledge the contribution we've just heard from the member for Higgins, and I appreciate her background and knowledge that she brings into this place on issues such as this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to admit that, until I was approached by the member for Mallee, this wasn't a cancer I was aware of. It reinforces why it is important to bring these private members' motions into the House. Not only is it important to reinforce the message to the government of the day, in terms of the importance of research and the anecdotes that members can bring about these things, but it also helps to broaden the understanding and awareness of something that's clearly a critical issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, DIPG is a very aggressive childhood brain cancer. It develops in the brain stem, striking children in the middle of childhood, with diagnosis typically around the age of five to seven. Tragically, at this stage there is no cure. It is the most aggressive of all childhood cancers, and it's the primary cause of death amongst paediatric brain tumours. Due to the location of the tumour, removal by surgery is not possible. Patients do not respond to chemotherapy and radiotherapy; care is palliative only. You can only imagine the heartache of having a child diagnosed with this and understanding that all you can do is help the child through to the end of their life at such an early age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in this place now for quite a number of years, and we have seen a turnaround in other cancers. We've seen research with immunotherapy now for melanoma, and melanoma is not the death sentence that it was. Not everyone responds to immunotherapy, but a large proportion of people do, and I personally know people who are alive today because of improvements in immunotherapy for melanoma. The breast cancer survival rate is also now much higher, largely due to the research. I remember a couple of years ago meeting a group, in the Mural Hall here, who were lobbying for research into rare cancers. Sadly, when they held the meeting the following year, the young lady that I spoke to had already passed away. So it is important that these harder, more deadly cancers are focused on in our research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of the research happens in the capital cities, but I'd like to make the House aware of some work that's happening in my part of the world, championed by Samuel Johnson from the Love Your Sister charity. Samuel's charity has raised about $20 million over the years. They're doing funding trials now—in conjunction with Macquarie University, the Western Cancer Centre Dubbo and the Royal Flying Doctor Service—in precision medicine with regard to cancer treatment. I'm sitting here looking at medical professionals—and I'm no medical professional—but it was explained to me that not all cancers are the same and that the sooner the individual make-up of a cancer is diagnosed the more precise the treatment can be. This trial will be not only in Dubbo but also in other centres—even the small community of Brewarrina and some of the more western towns. Upon diagnosis, a sample is taken and grown—I believe—in a lab. An identification of this cancer is made and, therefore, the treatment can be better targeted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we do know that incredible progress can be made. The families that have children diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma will be hanging onto hope that future breakthroughs will help their children survive this disease. I strongly support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  Investing in medical research and health care is a top priority of our government. Over this government's term in office, we have invested record amounts in improving access to health care right across the nation. Take, for example, the government's Medical Research Future Fund, the MRFF, which is a $20 billion long-term investment supporting Australian health and medical research. What the MRFF aims to do is transform health and medical research and innovation to improve the lives of all Australians and build the economy and contribute to the health system's sustainability. The federal government now uses the interest from this investment to pay for medical research initiatives and innovation right across the country. It is so important for Australians, as we all benefit from life-changing discoveries. It helps our researchers develop their ideas domestically and supports Australia's growing biotech industry, creating future jobs and exports, while also building stronger relationships between researchers, healthcare professionals, governments and the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where our investment in medical research is directly benefiting Australians is those children who are diagnosed with malignancy, with cancer. In Australia, brain cancer is a leading cause of death of children. Today, we are speaking on the motion moved by the member for Mallee on diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG. I will go into what that is. We know that those brainstem gliomas are heterogeneous in their activity. Activity ranges from low-range tumours to more rapidly fatal, aggressive disease of which DIPG is one. Prognosis and treatment often depend on the severity of those symptoms, their duration and the location of the tumour within the brainstem itself. From the title of this disease, we know it originates in the pons, which is a part of the brainstem, so the lower brain. Approximately 80 per cent of the midline gliomas occur within that section of the brainstem. The diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas are usually quite high-grade, are locally infiltrative and have a uniformly poor diagnosis amongst our paediatric patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The symptoms are varied. I know the member for Higgins went into detail about some of the symptoms. With this form of malignancy, we can get cranial nerve palsies, which are the nerves exiting the brain which control a lot of the function in the head and neck; long tract signs, things like hemiparesis where part of the body won't be able to move, affecting a child's mobility; hydrocephalus, which is water on the brain, increased pressure on the brain; and also bleeding within the tumour. All of these can lead to poor prognosis of the children who are suffering from this absolutely terrible, terrible disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be part of a government that's working collaboratively with the New South Wales government to invest in further breakthrough research in children's cancer so that one day we can live in a world—not just here in Australia but across the world—where we can cure cancers diagnosed in children. To reach this vision, the federal government has invested $100 million towards the Children's Comprehensive Cancer Centre at the Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick, and this collaboration between the federal, the New South Wales government and the Children's Cancer Institute aims to strengthen research and support 500 researchers and clinicians work on the challenge of paediatric cancer. This cancer centre is going to train our brightest minds in the vital quest to advance the treatment and prevention of childhood cancers. It will be like none other in Australia. It will be a fully integrated cancer centre, combining world-leading clinical care with groundbreaking research and education to change the face of paediatric cancer. It's said that this centre is going to be operational by 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also invested $99 million towards 29 research grants focused on childhood cancers through the returns from the MRFF, and $60 million of this investment is going to the Zero Childhood Cancer Program, a world-leading precision medicine program. This program uses the latest technology to screen cancers and search for drugs that can target them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I want to thank the member for raising this important issue. It's important that we really shine some light on this area. And I thank the other members for their contributions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  It's appropriate that we're having this discussion this month, given that September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. It's an appropriate time for us to note the sad burden of childhood brain cancer, particularly diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year 20 Australian children, usually aged between four and 11 years, are diagnosed with DIPG. 'Diffuse' means the tumours are not well contained. They develop in a part of the brain called the pons, which is responsible for a number of important bodily functions like breathing, sleeping, bladder control and balance. It's impossible to remove these tumours without damaging healthy tissue. Children with DIPG present with a short history of symptoms like facial weakness, headache, balance problems or squint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a paediatric neurologist, I can tell you what it is like, as can my colleague the member for Macarthur, to see a child in the emergency department with these symptoms, to talk to them, to examine them, to talk with their parents, to establish a rapport and to establish an assessment plan and then send them to the scanner. Then you sit in the radiology department waiting for images of the scan to appear. The hope is always that the symptoms are post-viral. When the images appear and it's a tumour, your heart sinks. It's like being kicked in the chest. When it's a DIPG, you go through the scans in detail, you talk to the radiologist and then, with sadness, you go to talk to the parents, knowing the conversation is going to change their lives forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no effective treatments for DIPG. The tumours can't be removed surgically and don't respond to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Our treatment is, at this point, essentially palliative. The average survival period is nine to 12 months. DIPG claims the life of an Australian child every two weeks. Recently I met with several families who travelled to Canberra to share their stories of DIPG and advocate for federal investment into research and therapies for this disorder. Their stories were characterised by overwhelming grief, loss and pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our medical research funding system spans five federal portfolios as well as philanthropic and private enterprise. We have challenges in optimising research allocation and ensuring equity in different areas and parts of the economy. Medical research funding in Australia should be based on the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines. It should be effective, efficient, economic and ethical. Unfortunately, medical research funding in this country has been subverted and politicised in recent years. Concerns were raised around allocations from the MRFF from the time of its inception in 2014. By 2020, 65 per cent of MRFF funding was noncompetitive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current proposal for a national strategy for health and medical research was informed by 15 years of health and medical research reviews, but we still don't have a clear picture of where the gaps and duplications lie. We need a comprehensive review of the Australian research landscape, highlighting priorities for investment to propel our progress as a kick-off point for a transparent and clear road map for more effective research funding allocation and grants administration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our medical research should have a patient centred approach in which researchers engage with patients and incorporate their experiences and insights into research which is impactful and which responds to real-world challenges. These reforms also have to produce funding models which are both accountable and transparent, with clear aims and with regular review of the progress and outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only $970,000 has been allocated to research into DIPG in this country since 2015, even though we have some world-leading researchers in this area—$970,000 to a cancer which kills one Australian child every two weeks. In Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, I call on the Albanese government to commit to a national strategy for health and medical research in which we can have confidence in the transparency and integrity of medical research funding in this country, in where it goes and in how it will improve health outcomes for all Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I thank my friend and colleague the member for Mallee for moving this motion. I'm very proud to inform the House that the member for Mallee and myself are equally committed to working together and with our fellow parliamentarians to promote better outcomes and understanding of childhood cancer. We've recently established the Parliamentary Friends of Childhood Cancer Cure, and we are planning to have the DIPG support group to Canberra to present to the greater parliament their concerns. We certainly do sympathise with them and understand their needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank my other medical colleagues, including the member for Robertson and, of course, the member for Kooyong, for their input into this motion as well as the others who have spoken. I note that the member for Kooyong, in her previous life, dealt with some of the most terrible disorders of childhood, including DIPG, in her role as paediatric neurologist, and I pay tribute to her for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a paediatrician, I've certainly looked after kids with DIPG. It's a terrible, harrowing illness from presentation to death, and it's pretty much a 100 per cent death rate at the present time. I remember, in my first days as a resident in North Shore Hospital, they had one of the first CT scanners in Australia. One of the patients we looked at was a seven-year-old girl who presented with double vision, who did have in fact a pontine glioma and who died fairly quickly after it. That was over 40 years ago, and I'm afraid the prognosis is changed very little in that time, very sadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has already been mentioned, the presentation can initially be with mild symptoms—headache, some vomiting, double vision, facial weakness—but pretty rapidly progresses. There's no effective treatment. Radiotherapy is essentially palliative, and death is often pretty quick. That is a really shocking experience for parents, for families, for clinicians and all the staff that look after these children. It is a terrible disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up until recently, there was really little hope, but there are some things that are changing. In particular, the initiative, the Zero Childhood Cancer group from Sydney Children's Hospital and the University of New South Wales, led by Michelle Haber, is doing some wonderful work with cancer genomics as part of the broader prospect trial, jointly funded by state and federal governments. We hope with this and the advances in genomic medicine there will be better treatments, and we hope there will eventually be a cure. But, of course, as the member for Kooyong and the member for Robertson have noted, this requires investment in early diagnosis, in early investigation and in research. Of course, we are, as the government, committed to that, and I think governments of all persuasions in the last 20 or 30 years have been committed to looking for cures for some of the most devastating cancers, not just in childhood but in adult life as well, and we are slowly making progress. There are much better genetically targeted treatments for childhood cancers. The prognosis for many of those childhood cancers is changing dramatically.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend and colleague Glenn Marshall, who's in parliament today, is a paediatric oncologist who has identified the genomic markers for one of the most devastating tumours of childhood, neuroblastoma, and we hope that similar advances will lead to better treatments for things like DIPG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has invested lots of money into childhood cancer programs, the Zero Childhood Cancer program being part of that, but more needs to be done. I agree—we need to look where their deficiencies are, and our medical research funding needs to be better targeted than it has been. I know the minister for health is certainly looking into this. We are routinely reminded that our children are our future, and we need to do more in terms of investment in research for some of these rare children's cancers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From day one, the Albanese Labor government have been focused on delivering on our commitment to strengthen aged care and improve the pay and working conditions of our aged-care workers right across the nation. For too long, those working in aged care have been asked to work harder for longer without enough reward. The Albanese Labor government understands this and is working hard to better support our aged-care workers. I'm pleased to move, and speak on, this motion, as this federal government has wasted no time in getting on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aged-care workers are some of the hardest-working Australians in this country. They are undertaking important work in caring for our older Australians who helped build the nation that we all enjoy today—a nation which is inclusive, diverse and strong and which looks towards the future. It is only fair and right that our hardworking aged-care workers are recognised with adequate remuneration and fair working conditions, and that is why, in this year's 2023-24 federal budget, the Albanese Labor government invested a record $11.3 billion over four years to fund a 15 per cent pay rise for our aged-care workers. What this means is that a registered nurse on a level 2.3 award wage will be paid an additional $145 a week, which equates to an annual wage increase of more than $10,000. If you're an assistant in nursing, or AIN, on a level 3 award wage, you will be paid an additional $136 a week, which equates to an annual wage increase of more than $7,100. If you are a head chef or cook on a level 4 aged-care award, you'll be paid an additional $141 a week, which equates to an annual wage increase of more than $7,300 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to my next point. The Albanese Labor government is acutely aware of the importance of tasty and nutritious meals in our aged-care facilities. As an emergency doctor, I know that it's vital that our older Australians living in aged-care facilities receive the necessary nutrition to live healthy and dignified lives and that we make sure we are combating the effects of malnutrition. I'm pleased that the federal government has established the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, which will be tasked with ensuring the quality of food and nutrition for our older Australians living in aged care. The commission has also established a new food hotline for food complaints and food advice, which is staffed by specialists. They will triage calls and work to assist Australians, aged-care providers and aged-care workers across a range of areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud of this government's work to get registered nurses back into our aged-care facilities. You do not have to be a healthcare professional or even have a family member in care to know the benefits of having registered nurses on site in our aged-care facilities. RNs can provide rapid care to patients in an emergency before our first responders arrive, as well as provide medical care and other care within the aged-care facility. Since the first month of this policy being in operation and the 24/7 RNs being back in aged-care facilities, there has been a major increase in the care received. RNs are now 23.5 hours a day on average in aged-care facilities right across the nation. This 24/7 registered nursing was a key recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. It was ignored by the now Leader of the Opposition and the coalition government during their time, which is not surprising, considering their record of neglect during their decade-long time in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's improvement measures in aged care are complemented by a range of other investments in health care more broadly—for example, our $3.5 billion investment into strengthening Medicare by tripling the bulk-billing incentive. This investment will see 73,130 people in my electorate of Robertson benefit, with easier access to a general practitioner. I'm also pleased that 41,789 people in my electorate will have the opportunity to buy two months worth of medicine for the price of a single prescription, and that applies to more than 300 common PBS medicines. These measures ensure better access and stronger health care for people living on the Central Coast. We are committed to continuing our work of improving aged care across Australia, and these measures are only the start.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  Labor never misses an opportunity for self-congratulation, and this motion is another outstanding example of backslapping by those opposite. Today I want to focus my attention on their claim that they are delivering the safe, high-quality care that our older Australians so desperately deserve. As Australians would recall, in the lead-up to the 2022 election Prime Minister Albanese and Minister Wells stood in front of the media day after day promising all sorts of things. They promised that they would better understand the issue and that they would deal with this in the government they would lead. 'We can do better than this,' Mr Albanese said. 'I will make it the Labor government's mission to fix this,' he said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is more important than keeping our most vulnerable loved ones safe: on that we all agree. It must be our No. 1 priority to protect those who cannot protect themselves and who have put their trust in us as a government to protect them. Yet, while those on the other side are patting themselves on the back and talking about how they are making food more tasty, the statistics on the care and the protection that they have failed to give our loved ones is confronting. The Department of Health and Aged Care report every week on the COVID-19 outbreaks in residential aged-care facilities. This is on their website for all to see. The statistics point to a government that is failing to do better as they promised those living in aged care they would. In fact, safety is much, much worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the facts. The Liberal-National government, from the outbreak of the pandemic until 2022, was in power. During those 29 months, 2,415 lives were lost to COVID-19 or COVID-19 related issues in residential aged care. It's sad. It's terrible. This was at the height of the pandemic and was at a time when we were developing our response to an unknown virus. We were transitioning from having no vaccination program, we were developing and improving vaccinations and treatments, and we were managing the upheaval of the pandemic and the issues that it was bringing to every aspect of Australian's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this time, the coalition was guided by trusted medical professionals who offered calm, expert and consistent advice. As we began to emerge from the pandemic in 2022, these same health professionals warned that the pandemic would continue to change and evolve. Governments would need be prepared to respond as needed and learn the lessons of the previous two years. They warned us in the first quarter of 2022 that we were moving into a critical time in aged care and that the federal government would need to act to prevent a wave of winter deaths from COVID-19 and the flu. All sides of politics were privy to this advice. The Albanese government was elected in May 2022. Now, remember that I said that 2,415 lives were lost in the 29 months to May last year. The latest weekly report is that in the 15 months of the Albanese government, under their watch, 3,444 lives were, sadly, lost in aged care to COVID-19 related causes. That is 3,444 in 15 months, under the watch of the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not better; this is much worse. Yet those opposite were handed the strategy to protect and prevent these deaths. You were left with a range of effective vaccinations and treatment protocols. With this advice, you are left with the best medical experts and their experience, yet you have overseen the loss of more lives to COVID-19 than were lost during the height of the pandemic. Not a single week has gone by without someone losing their life to a COVID-19 related cause in a residential aged-care setting, yet here you are, standing up and patting yourselves on the back. Shame on you. I call on you, the Albanese government, to address this terrible failure and update us on how you will do better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  Older Australians helped to make this country the great place that it is today. They worked hard their whole lives setting up for the future that we all enjoy. But as they age, they become more reliant on others to give them support and the care that they need. For helping to create this nation, they deserve quality support now that they have reached the point in their life where they need it more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ageing is something that most of us will experience; it is a part of life. As we age, many go into aged care, but sadly we have heard some horror stories about what has been going on in some of our aged-care systems. This is not good enough. Those in aged care deserve dignity, and we are a government committed to restoring dignity to our aged-care residents. We are starting to do this by delivering on our commitment to put nurses back into nursing homes, with 24 hours a day, seven days a week nursing care. It's hard to believe that our country got into a position where those in nursing homes did not always have nurses available to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When somebody moves out of their home and into aged care, it is one of the biggest moves that they have ever made in their life. It is a difficult time for many. The reason that someone makes the decision to go into a nursing home is that the care they need isn't always available to them. But what is the point if the nurses who can provide this specialised care aren't always there for them? Nursing homes need nurses available 24 hours a day, every day of the week, and that is what we are delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When an Australian moves into an aged-care facility, it should be a place that is safe, and it should be a place where they can get the highest-quality care. Not only do residents deserve to have this; their families and loved ones deserve peace of mind knowing that the facility is the safest and best possible place for their loved ones because of the high-quality care that is there for them. We are delivering this support for older Australians who live in aged-care homes. We are making sure that their place of residence is safe. We are making sure that the care available to them is to the highest standard in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who work in the aged-care sector work hard. Their job is tough. I have no doubt that at times it can be very draining, but they do a great job. During the pandemic, they were on the front line looking out for the most vulnerable in our community, and it's because of them that many older Australians in aged care avoided the worst of the pandemic. They deserve our thanks, but, to put it bluntly, those in this sector were getting ripped off. For the work they did and the toll this can take, their pay was nowhere near what they deserved. That is why this government fought so hard to deliver a record 15 per cent pay increase for aged-care workers across Australia. This is the largest ever pay rise in the history of the aged-care sector. It is a pay rise that these workers really did deserve, a pay rise that was long overdue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By now, you all know in this place that I love tasty, nutritious food. I believe that as an Australian you should have the right to enjoy food that is tasty and nutritious. But the reality is that some in aged-care facilities didn't always have access to food which was both great and enjoyable for them. We are putting a stop to this by working to ensure older Australians have tasty, nutritious food in aged care, as they should have. It is also important to note that this is just one part of what the government is doing to rebuild universal health care in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians deserve care that is affordable and that is the best you can find anywhere in the world. People in aged care are human. They are members of our community. They are our grandparents. They are our parents. They deserve the same dignity as any other person in our society, and nothing less. This is what our Labor government is providing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  It's very timely that we're having this debate in the Federation Chamber today, because we've just seen a recent report which shows that the number of aged-care facilities being built has slowed dramatically. As we know, the ageing of our community is continuing apace, and it should be of concern to all sides of this debate that we are now seeing aged-care residences being built at an ever-slowing rate. Not only that, we're seeing more and more challenges for aged-care providers to access the workforce that they need. I would ask the government to think again about how they are implementing the recommendations of the aged-care royal commission. As everyone knows, this royal commission was commissioned when we were in government because we wanted to set the pathway for the aged-care sector for the next decade in a sustainable way, a financially sustainable way, and in a way that would allow the care that was needed for our residents to improve, and to make sure that it continued to improve into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are decisions that the government have taken which they need to look at immediately. One of those is what the minister for immigration has done in requiring that before overseas workers can come into the sector to provide the care and the nurses that are needed, they need to enter into an MOU with the union. This is blocking the flow of overseas workers into the aged-care sector. To demonstrate that is what is occurring, I have the transcript of the minister on ABC Radio National this morning. He was asked by Hamish Macdonald:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How many providers have actually signed up to your agreement to access workers from overseas?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Giles said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Eight providers have signed up so far …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamish Macdonald responded: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But eight providers of something like 800 across the country—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">pointing out that this isn't working. Hamish then went on to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There does seem to be a concern about the unions and the level of access that they would have to these employees—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">when you enter into this MOU. Hamish pointed out that the aged-care providers that they'd spoken to were concerned that all of a sudden unions were being given unfettered access to aged-care facilities, and he asked the minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you think it's an impediment? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got only eight out of 800 that have done this, yet the minister is saying it isn't an impediment. And yet, when Hamish and the ABC have asked providers what's holding them back, it's the MOU that's holding them back. So the government needs to relook at all this, because it is this ill founded regulation which is leading to the slowness of the provision of new facilities. The regulations on the sector that the government is putting in place mean that they can't get access to the workforce that they need. If this continues, the situation is going to get worse and all of those recommendations by the royal commission, which were put in place, are going to be worth zilch if the government does not get this implementation right. There was nothing in the recommendations of the royal commission which said that the unions should be allowed in the front door and that aged-care providers should have to sign an MOU. I ask any of the speakers today to point me to where that provision was in the royal commission recommendations. It's just not there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you continue to put more regulation on aged-care facilities, and not in a way that will enhance the care that they give, then it's going to lead to more and more problems in the sector. So it is very timely that we are having this debate when we're seeing reports that the situation is getting worse. I say to the government: don't pat yourself on the back for what you've done in 16 months; have a look at what is still going wrong. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak to this motion on aged care. It's very important that we don't let the issue drop from sight, in spite of the many improvements that have been made across the sector. In previous terms of parliament, I was having to speak about aged care as being 'in crisis'. Now, we have made so many significant improvements that it is really starting to turn in the right direction. On this side, we care deeply about older people and their families; we care deeply about the workforce that works so hard to keep aged care going and provide good care. In the past year, there have been tangible improvements on the ground in aged-care facilities. There have been fewer falls, fewer pressure injuries, fewer avoidable hospital administrations and less use of antipsychotics, and more older people are feeling safe and respected. We're also seeing improvements in the star rating data, with fewer 1 and 2-star ratings and more 4 and 5-star ratings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How have these significant changes been made in a relatively short time on the back of an absolute crisis in aged care, exacerbated by the determination of the previous government to do the absolute minimum possible? The first decision we took was to support and fund a pay rise for the invaluable aged-care workers. We're investing $11.3 billion to deliver on our commitment to find the outcome of the Fair Work Commission case. That decision is the largest increase to award wages in a work value case under the Fair Work Act. It's 10 times more than the previous government's investment in their so-called workforce pillar. As a result, around a quarter of a million aged-care workers will receive a meaningful pay rise with potentially further increases to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the Fair Work Commission's interim decision, which was the 15 per cent increase for direct care workers. It's a huge step forward, but I note that it's just stage 2 of 3 on the Fair Work Commission's journey to its final decision. The pay rise was won by workers and the strong backing of their unions, who play a key role in lifting the standards for the workforce, strongly backed by us as a Labor government. The next decision we took was to set ambitious targets around care minutes and 24/7 nurses to improve the care of older Australians. We legislated the requirement for 24/7 nursing to make sure aged-care residents could get the clinical care they need around the clock. Our first set of data for 24/7 nursing revealed some really staggering improvements. On average, there is a nurse on site 98 per cent of the time, or 23½  hours a day; 86 per cent of all homes that reported data have a nurse 24/7; and the majority of remaining homes are extremely close to meeting the target. Knowing that care is available around the clock makes a real difference to families, as well as to those who are being cared for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turned our attention to food and nutrition. Under the former coalition government, the aged-care royal commission found that two-thirds of older Australians were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. Older Australians in aged care absolutely deserve to receive quality, nutritious and appetising food. We've invested millions in improving food in aged care, and that includes a dedicated food hotline for food complaints and advice, up to 720 provider spot checks annually and up to 500 menu and mealtime assessments each year for aged-care providers to be completed by independent, accredited practising dietitians. There's also $5 million for the Maggie Beer Foundation to educate aged-care chefs to deliver better food. That is free training to deliver better food and nutrition in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first components of the Maggie Beer Foundation's program are now available, with 11 online modules to teach aged-care workers how to increase flavour and nutrition for the older people in their care. All aged-care providers are invited to participate. This is to encourage a whole-of-sector uplift in food and nutrition. We've also strengthened accountability and transparency, which goes to the heart of the next phase of changes. We're committed to increasing transparency. From early next year, we will provide a full picture of how our residential aged-care providers are spending their money. There is more to do, and we will keep doing it.</span>

I thank him for recognising our nurses right across the country. Whilst I respect the member for his previous work, what the member for Robertson has not done is run a business, and his opening address has shown a lack of consideration for the implications that a shortage of available workforce and soaring inflation have had on any business, regardless of the types of goods or services that it provides.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of quality care at meaningful levels is paramount. To support our increasingly aging population, we need to do this. But the current 24/7 burden is quickly pushing regional aged care facilities to the brink of closure. We know that centres around the country have already begun to close under the strains, with reports of over 30 already shutting their doors since the announcement was made. Interestingly, these 30 have predominantly been in peri-urban and metro settings, locations that have better workforce access than the regions. But we've ready seen the writing on the wall, and many have left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further compounding the issue is the negative rate of growth when it comes to available beds in regional areas and inadequate growth even in the metro areas, compared to our aging population projections. In Cowper alone we have waiting lists in the hundreds to get into our local aged-care facilities, and yet, as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> just this morning:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Residential facilities in the major cities added just over 1200 beds in the past financial year, which is barely half the average pace of the past five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The number of beds in outer regional Australia has also gone backwards, with 86 fewer beds in remote areas in the 12 months to mid-2023 compared to an average annual growth of 116 beds over the five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an ever-growing aging population, and, as a result of this government's actions, we have a shrinking bed rate. The article goes on to explain that new staffing requirements are discouraging successful 'providers to expand their services due to a shortfall of available workers'. Of further concern is the sectors uncomfortable predicament that more than half of the aged-care facilities are actually operating at a loss, meaning they have no ability to apply for loans to physically build and expand their operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't an opinion piece; this takes into account the advice of industry heavyweights, and, in my own electorate, I'm hearing the same words from the smaller regional providers that service the Mid North Coast, providers like Nambucca Valley Care Group, who are recognised as one of the gold-standard providers in New South Wales. John Butler, the NVC Group CEO, has told me his concerns about the quality and standard of their facilities in years to come. NVC's buildings are aging and in need of upgrades and expansion to cope with the increasing client base, but, due to the sector's dwindling profitability and the impact of inflation, John is unable to put up a business case to acquire the further funds needed. NVC Group recognised the future issues early on, and 10 years ago they created a college onsite that offers a certificate III in individual support in order to train and retain local stuff, but it's not enough as enrolments have been on the decline since COVID. And this is the case across the board in the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the coalition instigated the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. It brought with it a number of recommendations, and I do acknowledge that this government is attempting to implement many of those, but, as we so commonly see from this government, there are changes introduced in knee-jerk fashion without proper consideration, and we need to look at this in detail. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  Older Australians helped build this country. They've worked hard, paid their taxes and raised their families. They rightly expect that their federal government will support them in their later years after a life contributing to their communities and to our nation. The Albanese government recognises this significant contribution and we're 100 per cent committed to better supporting our older Australians after a decade of neglect by the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In their time we saw an alarming rise in malnutrition amongst older Australians in aged care, a concerning lack of access to quality, timely care, rising allegations of assault and abuse in the aged-care sector and overuse of chemical restraints. What a woeful record that was, sadly, reconfirmed in the findings of the royal commission into aged care. The fact that the interim report of the royal commission was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> says it all. Unlike the coalition, we have taken a proactive approach to restoring care, dignity and respect into our aged-care system, a system that is highly dependent on the care provided by our much-valued aged-care workers. I know—and our government knows and our union advocates know—how much pride these aged-care workers take in their work. Many of these workers have shared their harrowing stories with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now in government, we are acting swiftly to end the barriers to quality, compassionate care. In the past year there has been a reduction in pressure injuries, physical restraints, significant unplanned weight loss and the use of antipsychotic drugs in aged care. We've also seen improvements in the star rating data, with fewer one- and two-star ratings and more four- and five-star ratings, fewer falls, fewer avoidable hospital admissions and more older people feeling safe and respected in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working in aged care is physically and emotionally demanding work. It is skilled work and the aged-care workforce deserve to be properly recognised in their pay for their work. This is why it was a top priority for our government to make a submission to the Fair Work Commission in support of a meaningful pay rise for aged-care workers. As a result, about 250,000 aged-care workers will receive a 15 per cent pay rise, with further increases to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also setting ambitious targets around care minutes and 24/7 nurses to improve the care of older Australians. To lift quality care and safety standards in residential aged care we are legislating around-the-clock nurses and increased care minutes. A skilled and dedicated workforce is the foundation of a better aged-care system—a system we all want to see. Our first set of data for our 24/7 nurses mandate revealed staggering improvements. On average there is a nurse onsite 98 per cent of the time, or 23½ hours a day. We have also addressed the shocking findings from the royal commission, which revealed that more than two-thirds of residents in aged care were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. A good meal with good nutrition is crucial to quality of life for everyone, but especially for older Australians. I am proud to say that the May budget invested $12.9 million to help make this happen. Our significant investment will increase the capability and, importantly, the accountability of aged-care providers to provide good food and nutrition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took a plan of action to the federal election to address the crisis in aged care—a plan that provides a clear direction in reforming the aged-care sector; a plan that was informed by the recommendations of the royal commission. We believe the work of the royal commission, the story told, the voice it gave to vulnerable older Australians and its recommendations are vital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for moving this important motion today. To care for those who once cared for us is a great honour, one that this government will always take to heart.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  The member for Robertson's motion is an important one, and there were elements of the member for Corangamite's speech which I heartily endorse. People who are in their twilight years have paid their taxes, have worked hard and certainly deserve the very best of care. But it is a little bit like that 1981 <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span> episode, 'The compassionate Society', where Minister Jim Hackett is reminded of a hospital that is going so well. It's top of the pops on every parameter, but it's got no patients! And, indeed, as you look around regional Australia, many of the aged-care centres at the moment have fewer patients, fewer people and fewer aged-care residents simply because they can't find the staff and simply because they can't meet some of the expectations and requirements brought about by this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission was important. We put it in place as a coalition government. Yes, some of the situations and some of the evidence was harrowing, to say the least. But you have a council-run aged-care centre in a little town such as Coolamon near Wagga Wagga, where they have had to close an entire wing, 11 beds, because they can't find the staff. Then you have this expectation from those opposite of 24/7 nursing. It just doesn't add up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we heard only today that a very high percentage—more than half—of aged-care centres across Australia are not making a profit—not making any money. At Adina Care Cootamundra I met with management, including chair Lee-Anne Hogan and board members Charlie Sheahan—who happens to be the local mayor—and Darryl Sedgwick. They are beside themselves about what they are going to do and how they are going to continue to provide the care, because they simply can't make ends meet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Cowra Retirement Village, known locally as 'Bilyara', chief executive officer Wayne Snelson is in exactly the same position as Cootamundra and Coolamon: they simply cannot find staff. They have great difficulty in making their books balance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care facility at Harden Murrumburrah has been taken over—thank goodness—and seems to be back on its feet, but it was a struggle for a long, long time. As the local member, I fought hard and advocated for the retention of services there when the then owners, Southern Cross Care, decided they were closing up. It was—I am not overplaying it or overstating it—a tragic situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, Signature Care has opened up a marvellous, new, state-of-the-art facility at Turvey Park. Unfortunately, some of the staff members have come from other facilities in regional centres to work there. So that places a drain on those other smaller facilities in other smaller towns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no mistake, no coincidence, that the speakers from the coalition on this motion are the members for Braddon, Wannon, Cowper and Mallee. They know—and I see the member for Gilmore here—and the people of the regions know what a crisis this is. Let's not play partisan politics about this: let's see what we can do together as parliamentarians to get the situation sorted. I appreciate that Minister Wells, who is responsible for aged care, has put conditions in there whereby aged-care centres can apply to put off the 24/7 nursing for a while. But the tsunami is coming, and it is coming to a regional town near you. It is coming to an aged-care centre or a retirement village near you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so, so sad when we lose service and lose beds. In Coolamon's case, it was an entire wing. Those residents either have to be shipped off to somewhere else a long, long way away, or they just shut the doors and the people who have their names down can go to a facility in somewhere like Narrandera or elsewhere—many, many kilometres away. Their loved ones, if they still have a partner, then can't visit them. They lose touch with the community that they have been in for all of their lives. It is so sad. We need to do better. We need to do better as a parliament. The government certainly needs to do better on this, because this is a major problem in regional areas. I call on the government to do everything it can and to show compassion and to make sure that they get this  situation sorted. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for tabling this very important motion. I am very pleased to be here today to speak about aged care. Improving aged care for residents and supporting our aged-care workers is something I am passionate about, and I know it is so important for people on the New South Wales South Coast. I remember vividly one conversation with a family member whose mum was in aged care. He lived away but he said: 'I worry about my mum. Can you please just fix aged care.' With the Gilmore electorate having the second-oldest demographic in Australia, there are many elderly people who need care in our region and many workers who show up, day in, day out to take care of the ones we love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I was elected in 2019, aged-care workers came to me many times crying out for more support. They said they just wanted more time to be able to care for residents. They wanted aged-care workers to be remunerated for the important work they do, and they wanted to be able to attract and retain aged-care workers in recognition of how important aged care is to our loved ones. The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety described the former government's approach to edge care as 'the minimum commitment it could get away with'. That's what aged care looked like under the former government—the bare minimum. But the tide is turning. I am proud that the Albanese Labor government is working to fix the aged-care sector. I care deeply about the people and families who rely on aged care, the dedicated workforce that sustains it and the quality of care they provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians deserve better than a broken aged-care system, and since being elected we have hit the ground running. Our reforms are producing real, tangible results on the ground, and I've seen them working. The Albanese Labor government committed $11.3 billion to fund and deliver a pay rise for aged-care workers. That's a 15 per cent pay rise for these essential workers. That's around 250,000 aged-care workers in this country getting a pay rise which is long overdue. Aged-care workers can now feel happy to have a government that understands the physical and emotional demands of their work as well as the skills required—a government who knows they deserve proper recognition in their pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a recent visit to a local nursing home I was told about the difference our fee-free TAFE is having on encouraging more people to study the Certificate III in Individual Support (Ageing), which is great news. We've also brought in 24/7 registered nurses to enhance the quality of care for older Australians and mandated an increase in care time per resident. This is in direct response to the aged-care royal commission's recommendations. Having nurses in aged-care facilities 24/7 is the right thing to do. It leads to better treatment and safety in the case of emergencies and also less strain on our hospital emergency departments. Quality care is better than emergency intervention and proper nutrition is key to better care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Food and nutrition in aged-care homes is another issue we're addressing. Two-thirds of older Australians were malnourished or at risk of malnourishment under the former coalition government. The importance of good nutrition can't be understated. The Albanese Labor government has invested $12.9 million to improve food quality and nutrition in aged care. This includes the establishment of a dedicated food nutrition and dining support unit, menu and mealtime assessments, dietary guidelines and a communication campaign to raise awareness of residents' nutritional needs.</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, transparency and accountability are essential in aged care. The Albanese Labor government has made it clear we are committed to increasing transparency regarding public dollars spent in aged care. Next year, we will provide a comprehensive breakdown of how residential aged-care providers allocate their funds. This will mean residents and families can make informed choices about their care providers. People will finally be able to see where and how the money is spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've listened to the experts and heard the voices of those who are impacted. The royal commission gave a voice to vulnerable older Australians, and we listened. Our 2023 budget allocated a record $36 billion to aged care, addressing 69 recommendations in full or in part, and we will continue our work in transforming the aged-care sector into something all Australians can be proud of.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  As both the shadow assistant minister for regional health and as the member for Mallee I have been so concerned about the regional aged-care crisis that I facilitated a regional aged-care summit in Mildura on 6 July this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, the coalition government established the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety to ensure our oldest and most vulnerable Australians receive the quality care they need and deserve. The royal commission recommended a registered nurse on duty 24-hours a day seven days a week in every aged-care facility across Australia by next July 2024. In a race for a headline, the Albanese Labor government mandated it earlier to 1 July 2023, a pledge they had to humbly admit they could not achieve, and hence exemptions are in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 100 regional aged-care summit attendees from peak bodies and the coalface were all on board with delivering registered nurses 24/7 in aged care, but regional providers highlighted how hard this is to actually achieve in the context of the workforce crisis in regional Australia: 'The 24/7 registered nurse requirement creates a perverse decrease in care continuity by preferencing the employment of inexperienced agency RNs compared with personal-care assistants, enrolled nurses and endorsed enrolled nurses who have provided care for many years to residents in that same aged-care facility.' The summit highlighted that there was a cost premium to deliver aged care in regional Australia and the perverse financial incentives that prioritise care workers to practice in the public system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The knock-on effect of Labor's rushed approach is evident in my electorate of Mallee, with Dimboola's Allambi Elderly Peoples Home closing its doors. Earlier this year, shadow minister for health and aged care, Anne Ruston, and I visited Maryborough's Havilah Hostel in my electorate amid fears of their closure. I'm pleased to say that advocacy for Havilah has paid off and they have received some federal funding to keep their doors open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, in Queensland, Mount Morgan's Carinity Summit Cottages and Petrie Gardens Aged Care Service in Tiaro announced they were closing, displacing over 30 elderly residents. It is estimated that 30 aged-care facilities have had to close across this nation in Labor's reckless policy rush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on the coalition's funding in aged care. In August 2021, the former coalition government funded $150 million in capital grants under the Aged Care Approvals Round, which in Mallee included $4.5 million for Princes Court Homes in Mildura; $4.66 million for Oasis Aged Care in Irymple in my patch; $4.96 million for Havilah in Maryborough, which I just spoke about; and $350,000 for the Cohuna Village. The 2021-22 budget included $396.9 million over five years for capital investment to enable aged-care providers to improve their buildings and build new services. In 2022, the coalition spent a further $35.3 million in multipurpose services programs to update and upgrade 110 aged-care sites, improving services in Robinvale and Manangatang in my patch. The coalition's 2022-23 budget committed $522 million in funding for aged-care reform, taking the total investment in response to the royal commission to $19.1 billion. By 2025-26, funding in aged care is estimated to grow to $34.7 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In home care, the Liberals and Nationals increased new home-care packages by 357 per cent, from 60,000 under Labor in 2012-13 to 275,597 in 2024-25. The regional aged-care summit highlighted, again, the regional cost premium to deliver home-care services. Packages cannot fully deliver what recipients need, due to workforce shortages. The summit recommended a regional travel supplement to address the city-country divide. The summit also recommended a growth funding round for the Commonwealth Home Support Program to enable more providers to enter the regional market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I address the motion, I want to put the following facts on record. Richard Boyle blew the whistle on egregious use of garnishee notices by the Australian Taxation Office. David McBride blew the whistle on war crimes in Afghanistan. The actions of both whistleblowers have resulted in public good, yet both men are being prosecuted for their actions and both are relying on whistleblower protection laws that the Attorney-General has acknowledged to be inadequate. The prosecutions are having a chilling effect on whistleblowing in Australia. The Attorney-General has the ability under section 71(b) of the Judiciary Act to decline to proceed further in the prosecution, and this power has been granted to him so that he may discharge his ultimate responsibility to the parliament and to the people for the conduct of the prosecution process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion relates to a matter that is well known to the House and to the Australian people—namely, the lack of transparency around how the Attorney-General may choose to exercise his statutory power under the Judiciary Act of 1903 to stop the prosecutions of people who are doing nothing more than seeking to expose the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As members would be aware, during last week's parliamentary sitting, on two separate occasions, questions and motions were put to the House calling on the Attorney-General to step in and stop these prosecutions. Each were either brushed off or blocked by the two major parties with only 15 members in this place—all the Independents, the Greens and one other that was brave enough to cross the floor—voting in favour of debate around this matter being prioritised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, one of the reasons used to block the debate was the claim that these matters are sub judice. So, before proceeding, I'd like to address that issue because in this circumstance I think it's being used to stymie appropriate public debate. While it is generally the practice of the House that matters awaiting, or under, adjudication in the court of law are not brought forward in debate, the application of the sub judice convention is a matter of discretion of the Speaker. In turn, the Speaker is obliged to uphold the inherent right of the House to inquire into and debate matters of public importance, while at the same time ensuring the House does not set itself up as an alternative forum to the courts or permit the proceedings of the House to interfere with the course of justice. The approach taken by successive Speakers was authoritatively expressed by Speaker Snedden in 1976 when he emphasised that, while the sub judice rule applies to matters that would be to the prejudice of litigants before a court, it is vital 'not to interpret the sub judice rule in such a way as to stifle discussion in the national parliament on issues of national importance.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's motion, then, is an important next step in breathing oxygen into this debate. It's not about the court proceedings related to Mr Boyle and Mr McBride but, rather, the Attorney-General's resistance to exercising his power, under section 71(b) of the Judiciary Act 1903, to not proceed further in prosecution or to provide clear guidance on what circumstances would prompt him to exercise this power. Section 71(b) of the Judiciary Act provides that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When any person is under commitment upon a charge of an indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, the Attorney-General … may decline to proceed further in the prosecution …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this 47th Parliament, the Attorney-General has exercised this power once—to end the prosecution of Mr Bernard Collaery. At the time he said that he 'had careful regard to our national security, our national interest and the proper administration of justice'. In parliament this week, the Attorney-General responded to questions as to why he would not intervene in the circumstances of Mr Boyle and Mr McBride by saying that the power of the Attorney-General 'is reserved for very unusual and exceptional circumstances'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the Attorney-General, then, is: what constitutes very unusual and exceptional circumstances, particularly when this standard is not articulated in anywhere in section 71 of the Judiciary Act? Rather, it would appear this test is the test that only the Attorney-General himself is able to define, so I ask him to please do so. Both Mr McBride and Mr Boyle have already been subject to protracted and costly proceedings. Every day the government lets these prosecutions continue. They are sending a clear message that to blow the whistle is to bring the full force of the law down on your own head. In this context, by any measure, surely, these prosecutions are, at best, unwarranted and not in the public interest, and, at worst, punitive. Surely, then, they are unusual and exceptional circumstances.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the people of North Sydney, I appeal to the Attorney-General: please use your executive power to stop the prosecutions of these two whistleblowers. To do anything less is to continue to send a clear message to those who would speak truth to power that they should not do it, as rather than stand with them, power will work to shut them down.</span>

On our watch, the National Anti-Corruption Commission has commenced and overdue reforms to whistleblower legislation have been passed. That does not mean that there isn't more to do. The Attorney-General was strongly of the view that integrity and the rule of law are central to Australia's criminal justice arrangements. The Attorney-General's power to discontinue proceedings is reserved for very unusual and exceptional circumstances.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prosecution of alleged Commonwealth crimes is a matter for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, or CDPP, acting in accordance with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. That policy requires the CDPP to be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute the case and that the prosecution is in the public interest. Under the policy, the CDPP also considers whether a prosecution should continue. As Mr McBride's and Mr Boyle's proceedings remain ongoing, it is inappropriate for me to comment further on the particulars of their matters. However, I note that the government is committed to delivering strong, effective and successful protections for whistleblowers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already delivered priority amendments to the Public Interest Disclosure Act and will commence the second broader stage of reforms, which will include public consultation on the following: broader reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act to provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers and address the underlying complexity of the existing scheme. This also includes the need for additional supports for public sector whistleblowers, such as a whistleblower protection authority or commissioner. The government is delivering on its commitment to ensure that Australia has effective frameworks to protect whistleblowers, which are critical to supporting integrity and the rule of law. Reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act have been long overdue, and significant reform is required to restore the act to a scheme that provides strong protection for public sector whistleblowers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has passed legislation to strengthen protections for public sector whistleblowers already in this term, delivering on our election commitment to deliver those overdue reforms of the Public Interest Disclosure Act. Those reforms include some of the following changes. The Public Interest Disclosure Amendment (Review) Act reinforces the positive duty to protect whistleblowers and principal officers by requiring them to provide ongoing training in education to public officials in their agency. It strengthens protections for disclosures and introduces protections for witnesses, including expanding the definition of detriment that will attract remedies. It enhances the oversight roles of the Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. It facilitates the reporting and sharing of information related to public interest disclosures to ensure that they can be properly addressed. It improves the allocation and investigation processes for authorised officers and principal officers, and removes solely personal work related conduct from the scope of disclosable conduct. This helped to ensure that immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower scheme were in place before the NACC commenced on 1 July 2023. Those reforms, as I said, were overdue, but there's more to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second stage will involve redrafting the Public Interest Disclosure Act to address the underlying complexity of the scheme and provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers. This will include consulting widely on whether there's a need to establish a whistleblower protection authority or commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act and our government's broader Australian Public Service reform agenda are about restoring the public's trust and faith in government and its institutions, and achieving this by rebuilding the capacity and expertise of government. Looking around the world at the state many great democracies find themselves in and contemplating the challenges for our country that loom on the horizon and creep ever closer to us, there are few tasks more important than restoring trust in, and the capacity of, government. The government has already taken significant steps to rebuild trust and transparency in government; suggesting that it hasn't is disingenuous. To reiterate: this government does not support the member for North Sydney's motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The media release went on to note:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… blowing the whistle on crime and misconduct is incredibly difficult, with whistleblowers often facing reprisals, and some are never able to work again. For many Australians who see wrongdoing and want it to stop, blowing the whistle isn't worth the risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor described its commitment to a whistleblower protection authority as a one-stop shop to support and protect whistleblowers, with dedicated staff to advise whistleblowers on their rights, assist them through the disclosure process and help them access compensation if they faced reprisals. I agree with this wholeheartedly. I would simply say to the government: get on with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, the Attorney-General again alluded to these intentions in the House, as my colleague opposite has today, yet two whistleblowers await potential jail for telling the truth, the NACC is up and running, and the whistleblower commissioner is nowhere to be seen. As Professor John McMillan noted in this week's <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Paper</span>, it's easy to be very pro transparency and accountability from opposition, but governments tend to behave very differently—and he should know; he's a former Commonwealth ombudsman and was inaugural head of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a huge step forward that we have the National Anti-Corruption Commission, but to function effectively the NACC must be accompanied by enhanced protections for whistleblowers, preferably via a standalone whistleblower commission or, failing that, a NACC commissioner with specific whistleblower responsibilities. The Attorney assured us that it was his intention to have an effective update of whistleblower protections in place at the same time as the NACC started to operate on 1 July. So far, some technical amendments to the Public Interest Disclosure Act have been put in place, with more reform to come, but, in the meantime, whistleblowers remain at risk. And as for a whistleblower protection authority, all we have is a commitment from the Attorney to a discussion paper on the need for a public sector authority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among other things, at the very least, as I suggested with proposed amendments at the time of the NACC debate, the government needs to: strengthen the definition of corrupt conduct to ensure it doesn't capture the use of government information received by journalists; legislatively protect whistleblowers who make external disclosures, including to journalists, in instances when the investigation of their disclosure or the response to the investigation of their disclosure has been inadequate; limit the power to issue search warrants in cases like the raids on the ABC and the home of reporter Annika Smethurst; require all warrant applications impacting journalists or their informants to be contested by an independent public interest advocate who is a retired judge, practising senior counsel or King's Counsel; and exclude the premises of media organisations from the NACC's powers to search without a warrant. Unless and until adequate protections are put in place for whistleblowers and until there is institutional support for people seeking to expose corruption, good public-spirited individuals with the best of intentions will be intimidated out of reporting wrongdoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have in the two cases highlighted in this motion is persecution by prosecution, and that can only have a chilling effect on others who have come across wrongdoing, official or corporate. This is backed up by empirical research by the Human Rights Law Centre finding that as many as eight in 10 whistleblowers face some form of detriment at work. In the cases of Richard Boyle and David McBride, the cost has been immense in personal, professional and financial terms. They now face possible jail time for helping reporters to tell the truth about matters of declared public and national interest. The solution to that, therefore, is in the hands of the Attorney-General. He has the authority under section 71 of the Judiciary Act to decline to proceed further with a prosecution for an indictable offence. Also in his hands is the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority and the other measures that I mentioned earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General was content to endorse such pledges from opposition in 2019. It's time to get on with it and implement those commitments now that Labor is in government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  Transparency was one of the most important issues at the last election, and I can say, from personal experience of talking to people who were considering their vote throughout my electorate, that it determined many people's votes. The reason I state that here is that it has been one of the government's greatest priorities during this term in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're going to disagree on some issues in this Chamber during the course of discussing this motion, I do want to acknowledge from the outset that, across the chamber as people are sitting right now, there is a great deal of agreement on some first-order issues when it comes to how we should deal with transparency and when it comes to some of the systemic aspects of this issue—for example, the need for a national anticorruption commission with teeth and the need for whistleblower regulation. There will be aspects of this motion that I can't agree with and that the government, undoubtedly, wouldn't agree with, but I think it's important to set the scene and the context for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a first-order issue, and I do want to put on the record that I think a great deal of progress has been made. Certainly I wouldn't want to be part of a government that was going down the same well-trodden path of previous governments, and I don't believe that that's the case when it comes to many key aspects of reform in this area. I will get to the issue of whistleblowers, but I do think it's important to mention, at least, the NAC that has been implemented. This was, I believe, one of the key broken promises of the previous government. There was an inordinate delay—unexplained and unjustified—in the drafting of the legislation. Then, when the legislation was drafted, it sat outside the chamber, ridiculously, waiting for the opposition to make certain statements about it. Thirdly, there was the actual content of the bill, with the Commonwealth integrity commission, as put, described by senior lawyers across the board as deeply flawed, a disaster and having no teeth. David Ipp, the former commissioner of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption said that Morrison had created the kind of integrity commission you would want when you don't want to have one. So that is a huge step forward, and, as I said, I think everybody in this chamber at the moment would support the broad reform that has been implemented during this term of government.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to whistleblowers. Again I want to state from the outset that whistleblowers do play an important role in uncovering corruption. They promote integrity and good governance, and the broad regulation of whistleblower behaviour is absolutely key, so the Albanese government has already passed legislation to strengthen protections for public sector whistleblowers. We've delivered on the election commitment to deliver long overdue reform of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013, passing priority amendments. Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These initial technical changes will start to breathe life back into federal whistleblower protection in tandem with the Albanese Government's historic success in establishing Australia's long awaited national anti-corruption commission. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will a second stage of reforms that will involve redrafting the Public Interest Disclosure Act to tackle the scheme's complexity and to provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers. So there's a lot that's been done and more will be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the particular case that has been raised, individual cases can be difficult to discuss and they involve difficult consideration of particular circumstances. On top of that, there is the difficulty of the fact that attorneys-general rarely discontinue cases. It is not something that happens very often. As has been noted, it occurs under very unusual and exceptional circumstances. Sensible people can disagree on whether a particular fact case is very unusual and exceptional. The Commonwealth DPP considers a wide range of factors when determining whether to bring a case forward. We all believe in the rule of law. That does involve the Attorney-General using the power of discontinuance very rarely. I support the government's actions to date, with more to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-six years ago, when we lost our first child, families experiencing stillbirth were unable to register the birth or the death of their child. Parents and mothers were told to go home and forget about it and to try and have another baby. In New South Wales you can now register a stillbirth and an early pregnancy loss. This makes a tangible difference to parents, ensuring that everyone recognises what has happened to them and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next month marks Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, with 15 October being Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, a moment in which hundreds of thousands of families across Australia remember and mark the shared loss of their babies. The loss of a baby is heartbreaking. The sorrow, the grief, the pain that is felt and the emotions that are experienced are unique and unimaginable. It is an experience that devastates families. The thought of what could be at those times, when families are celebrating birthdays, weddings, footy grand finals and graduations, is when the loss of those who are missing is most acutely felt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year 3,000 families are told that their babies will not survive, and yearly the estimate is that 100,000 women will experience miscarriage. It is estimated that 25 per cent of pregnancies end in miscarriage—an experience that is, unfortunately, too common. Despite the experiences of a quarter of those who get pregnant, it is often overlooked and diminished with well-meaning but misplaced comments. Being told, 'Don't worry, you'll have another baby,' or, 'At least you can get pregnant,' does nothing to ease the grief, because we wanted our baby and not to have to start again. Whilst these comments are well meaning, the comments are the consequence of the much broader, more systemic issues of health and women in our society, one that diminishes and fails to take seriously the experiences of women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other is how we collectively process and speak about loss. Speaking of grief can be seen as awkward and uncomfortable. It is an experience, though, that we all share. Feelings of loss are as valid as any other feelings. Next month families across Australia and on social media will be posting images of candles for their lost babies. It's a public acknowledgement to give families the opportunity to express their heartache and grief, which is important for some level of healing and comfort. While it doesn't erase the scars, the acknowledgement can help ease the pain. If it can reduce the stigma and encourage more people to speak about their loss, our society will be better for it. Recognition will help raise funds for research into reducing the incidence of stillbirth, miscarriage and neonatal loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the fact that miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal deaths are much higher for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women as well as women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The perinatal mortality rate for Indigenous women between 2015 and 2019 was 15 babies per 100,000 births compared to nine per 100,000 for non-Indigenous women, and this gap has not significantly changed over a decade. We must do more and we must do better to close the gap. Every year we delay and for every measure that fails, more Indigenous babies are lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infant loss is something that is incredibly personal, and it can feel isolating, but help and support are out there. In November last year, Assistant Minister Kearney announced $5.1 million in grants to organisations that provide high-quality evidence based bereavement care nationally for women and families who've experienced stillbirth or miscarriage. Support services such as SANDS, Miracle Babies and Red Nose are there to help families navigate what is an incredibly difficult journey. I know this because they were there for me when I needed their support. I want to thank them for all that they do for those who experience such a heartbreaking loss, and I want to acknowledge those who will share their stories both in this house and across Australia. It is difficult but necessary to ensure our babies are never forgotten.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As shared already, more than 100,000 Australians are impacted by miscarriage every year, and, on average, six babies are stillborn every day and two infants pass away within 28 days of birth. When I spoke last year, I shared the story of local nurse Collette Butler, who lost her daughter Amelia at 38 weeks and four days during labour. It was a really strange few months of physically being in pain from grief and sadness but also trying to figure out, as Collette said, 'What do I do now?' Driven by a desire to support other families experiencing pregnancy and infant loss, Collette reached out to me seeking support for a fundraising event that she held in October last year to raise funds and awareness. Using the funds raised, Collette has gone on to establish the not-for-profit organisation Beyond the Rainbow and to create baby loss gift boxes to donate to grieving parents. Designed as a compliment to Bears of Hope, the boxes include items such as a baby memory journal, baby loss affirmation cards, a soft toy and a photo frame. The box also includes a resource book called <span style="font-style:italic;">A little help </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rom Jack</span> written by Emily Judd, whose second child, Jack, was born still at 39 weeks. Beyond the Rainbow has a mission to support families experiencing baby loss and to healthcare providers, with a focus on sustainability and sustainability of care that will result in more supportive outcomes within the healthcare setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I know many bereaved parents receive excellent health care after enduring pregnancy loss, it is distressing that in Tasmania there are no bereavement units available for parents. This matter has been acknowledged by Collette herself, and Emma and Adam Deane, who recently wrote to the Tasmania government requesting additional support for bereaved parents. Emma says: 'The loss of a child can occur at any stage of pregnancy, and we hope that in the future there is a safe and inclusive space for those experiencing the trauma of loss. Is it unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that there would be a safe and inclusive space where families experiencing the loss of a child not be placed on a maternity ward with constant reminders? Would it not be reasonable to have a space specifically suited to families in the same situation as ours, where you feel safe to leave your room? A space with trauma informed clinicians who specialise in assisting families who have experienced the loss of a child, whether it be at the beginning of pregnancy or at full term?' I'd encourage health ministers from all states to put in place best practice care for parents navigating pregnancy and infant loss, to help ease the grief that they're suffering. A separate space removed from the maternity ward and with the right wraparound services would be a good place to start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge local small-businesses owners Amanda Reilly and Jasmine Shepherd, co-owners of the wonderful independent store adoreu baby, in Launceston. Adoreu baby is believed to be the first baby goods store in the country to have a gift range for bereaved parents. Amanda said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think, being inclusive as a baby store, that you need to include those people; they also had a baby. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their initiative has been supported by Keren Ludski from Red Nose Australia, who has encouraged more baby stores to stock items related to infant loss as a way of taking away the taboo that can still follow the topic of pregnancy and infant loss. Ms Ludski says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's so important, equally for bereaved parents and for those friends and family of bereaved parents, to know that there is something they can buy that is meaningful and establishes that ongoing connection for the parents to that baby, and also shows that bereaved family that you're here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart goes out to anyone impacted by pregnancy and infant loss, and I want to say that your baby and your experience matters. Finally, my congratulations to Collette and her partner who have recently welcomed their second child, a beautiful baby boy, Franklin.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I'd like to acknowledge my friend and colleague, the member for Werriwa. Over 36 years ago, I was also involved with a baby who died—Anne's baby. And I know that no-one could have cared for their first-born more than Anne and Larry. It's difficult to give this speech, because, as a paediatrician, I remember every baby I've looked after who's died, and they are all important. They are all important to our families and to our society, and I hope I've never been involved in a situation where I have said, 'Just move on,' because you can't. You can come to terms with it, perhaps, but you never quite understand it and you never quite forget it—and neither should you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we're very lucky. We have low perinatal mortality rates of under 10, as does most of the developed world. But there are countries around the world that have perinatal mortality rates sometimes two or three times greater than Australia's: countries like Afghanistan and even Pakistan, which is nuclear power that has perinatal mortality rates over 30. Some of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa have similar rates. But, in Australia, the rates have been very slow to come down past that nine or 10 per thousand births. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are reasons for perinatal loss. I'm a really strong promoter in this parliament of the first thousand days child-health policies. That looks at how we can help people from preconception through to the second year of life to prevent developmental and physical problems in children. Part of that policy looks at how we can prevent preterm birth, which is the strongest risk factor for perinatal death, and proper nutrition, which is another factor that is related to perinatal death around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's more we could do. We can do better, looking at the genetics of perinatal death. We can do more, looking at maternal factors, such as hypertension and pre-eclampsia. There is much more we could do. That's why it is so important, on 15 October, to remember Pregnancy and Infant Loss Day and remember to not just support those families but to look at what we can do, as a government, to promote research into these most vital areas. I think there is much that the government is doing, and will do, but it needs to be done in a coordinated fashion. There is room for having a national policy on perinatal death that looks at research and appropriate management not just for the cities but for rural, regional and remote areas, because being remote is a factor in perinatal death, as is Aboriginality. We need to make sure that everyone gets equal access to support during pregnancy, and both prior and after, to make sure we can bring down those perinatal mortality rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very personal, and every family should be supported. I feel for everyone who has lost a child, particularly in these circumstances, which often, as the member for Werriwa knows, occur without any warning or explanation and are often associated with feelings of deep, deep loss that aren't appropriately managed in those first few days and afterwards. Every person who is involved in a perinatal death, be it nursing staff, be it obstetricians, be it paediatricians, be it families and the wider family as well, is affected by perinatal death and perinatal loss. It's very important that we as a society understand that that perinatal period is one of the most common risk times for a child and do more to prevent and manage it so that we can reduce our perinatal mortality, which affects the whole society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fully support the motion moved by Ms Stanley. I congratulate and thank all those who have spoken on this. I look forward to doing what we can as a government to make life much better for people who have experienced perinatal death.</span>

                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion, which has been brought by the member for Werriwa. I thank the member for Werriwa for her courage in speaking out about this issue and for sharing a very personal experience. I also acknowledge the previous speaker on this, the member for Macarthur, for the work he has done not only in this place but also as a doctor for many, many years looking after not just mothers but also children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">October is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. Sunday 15 October marks Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. This day acknowledges the shared loss experienced by parents, friends and health workers of those little ones lost too soon, whether through miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death or any other loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I'm speaking on this is personal. I gave birth to two very premature boys, just over 17 years ago now. They were born at 27 weeks—13 weeks premature. Although our outcome was a positive one, during our journey through a number of neonatal intensive care units, including down here at the Canberra Hospital, we saw firsthand some very different outcomes. I think that anyone who has seen a parent go through the loss of a child never forgets it. Certainly we need to do all that we can as a government and as a society to support families, whether it be through a miscarriage, whether it be through a stillbirth or whether it be through some other birth trauma. That's why I support this motion, and I commend the government for providing $5.1 million to organisations to support women and their families following stillbirth or miscarriage. And 15 October serves as a moving reminder of the universal sadness felt by parents, friends and healthcare professionals in the wake of a devastating loss of infants, however that may have occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak firstly about miscarriage. Often the joy and excitement that a much hoped for pregnancy brings sadly ends in tragedy and grief for far too many Australians. I've had friends who have gone through miscarriages, and they said for them one of the worst parts was the loneliness and the isolation. Many women miscarry in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, which is usually a time when women don't feel that they can share their joy publicly, so then they often have to go through this quietly with their partner, and there is a big sense of grief during that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the numbers in Australia, 110,000 Australians experience a miscarriage every year, more than 2,000 experience stillbirth and almost 700 lose a baby within the first 28 days after birth. I think this day and this month highlight the recognition of these numbers, which really do underscore the gravity of the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families undergoing these traumatic events need significant support. No amount of economic or financial support can heal their grief, but it can go some way. Workplace measures which are now in place to help parents suffering through either infant loss or pregnancy loss are of some assistance. Providing that much-needed social support and economic support is something we can do to assist these women and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today serves as an important opportunity, and I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of organisations like Red Nose Australia, Still Aware, SANDS and Miracle Babies. These organisations serve as a key pillar of strength for bereaved parents and families and provide immeasurable guidance and support. By addressing these issues together, we prioritise support for these families. I commend the government for the $5.1 million that's being invested in these organisations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I'm very happy to rise in support of this motion, and it's a very timely one. It wasn't that long ago I was up at Highfields, in the north of my electorate, opening Road Safety Week. It's a great opportunity to stand beside not just the police but all the emergency service personnel who play such an important role in keeping us safe and looking after us when accidents occur. At every one of these events, I try to tell a personal story; I think we all have personal stories of how road safety impacts us. This year I was talking about a friend of mine, Dean Batchelor, a truck driver and a kid I grew up with—a great concreter, actually; he worked with me for a lot of my youth. He was sadly caught in an accident not that long ago, and he is now on the Lights on the Hill memorial down in Gatton, where those who lost their lives in the trucking industry are remembered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important motion for us, particularly in regions like mine where the Black Spot Program is such a great program in supporting local road infrastructure improvements and upgrades. Recently, we celebrated two of those projects being completed in our area: the intersection of Bridge and Hume Street had a set of traffic lights put in there, where there had been serious accidents because of visibility issues that have been resolved—there are now dedicated left-hand turning lanes that have made a huge difference; and Perth and Curzon Street, another suburban section of road that the Black Spot Program did a great job of addressing. We've got Margaret and Mackenzie Street being upgraded in the next couple of weeks, another part of our local community where there are significant issues with visibility in suburban streets largely because of the trees on the side of the road and the hilly areas. I was also down at the corner of Canning and Brisbane Street, in Drayton, identifying another area where there is a perfect opportunity for black spot funding to come through; I'm very happy to support that application there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program has done so much good for us in our region, and I hope it will continue to do so. To put it into context of why it is such a crucial program—and I think it's even more important now—we're seeing the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program being brought to an end beyond 2026. This has been an absolutely crucial program for funding local roads, bridges, that sort of thing, in regional areas. Unfortunately, to see that wrapped up while the minister is still talking it up and talking about what good it's done leaves a bit of a sad taste in the mouth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got the Road Safety Program coming to an end in 2025. This is the program that the automotive association of Australia said they were extremely disappointed to see funding redirected away from. This was basically a program that allowed funding for safety upgrades of almost any road, any issue. It was a 'use it or lose it' model. It forced local governments into getting on with the action of making roads safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is sad to see this one being wrapped up, and I would also point out just how difficult it is for councils to deliver these road improvements. We've seen the federal assistance grants reduced. The LGAQ president Linda Scott came out all guns blazing on that one, because this reduction in the funds that the councils have to address roads and infrastructure in their regions is just another slight that is borne within changes in all of these infrastructure funding packages. If you put that beside the 90-day infrastructure review, which is now out to 130 days, we're seeing a halt on the delivery of some if these key projects, and they are so crucial in areas like mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate pretty much sits exactly within Toowoomba Regional Council. We have a highly urbanised area throughout inner-city Toowoomba, but as soon as you drive outside of that you've got roads that simply do not have the same funding, because of the lower density populations in those areas. It's incredibly difficult for the council to fund those road upgrades that are so crucial. In those areas it's no longer just about commuters and access around the city; at that point we're talking about how we keep livelihoods going. It's about how we get produce to port. It's absolutely crucial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a long history of bipartisanship going back a number of governments when it comes to funding road safety improvements, and I hope we see that continue. I hope to see the Black Spot Program made easier and more accessible for councils, because right now they're finding their funding reduced.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  Our roads are the lifeline of our communities, connecting us to our families, our workplaces and our aspirations. I believe that road safety is paramount, and every journey taken, regardless of the mode of transport, should be made with the goal of reaching our destination safely. The government's Black Spot Program is a key program, instrumental in enhancing road safety across our vast nation. First introduced by the Hawke government in 1996, it aimed to reduce the number and severity of crashes on Australian roads over three years. It targeted locations with a history of road accidents, hence the name 'black spot'. For over two decades the Black Spot Program has been steadfast in its commitment to reducing the risk of road crashes. It has successfully funded projects across our country aimed at improving road safety in areas where it is needed most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport visited my electorate of Tangney in May this year, she came to announce key commitments under the Black Spot Program which would substantially improve 24 dangerous crash sites on Western Australia roads in 2023-24. For my constituents, this means the installation of a roundabout and upgraded street lighting at the intersection of Corbel and Modillion Avenue North in Shelley in the electorate of Tangney. I was so thankful that this was finally happening under our government, after a tragic accident at this site back in January 2021claimed the life of a 17-year-old young man on his motorcycle. There was also something that frustrated me: Why did it take so long for something to happen? Why didn't the previous government do something to address this sooner?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was a police officer, I attended so many traffic crashes. It is against this backdrop that I advocate and support amendment of the black spot road safety program guidelines to make it easier for local government to be able to access this vital funding. Half of our road crashes occur on local government roads. These crashes are responsible for 52 per cent of all casualties and 40 per cent of all road deaths. These numbers are not just statistics; they represent lives disrupted, families torn apart and communities scarred. It is our moral duty to address this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Numerous lives have been spared and countless injuries prevented due to the intervention made possible through the Black Spot Program. However, as effective as the program has been, there are challenges in ensuring the local government sectors have equitable access to this funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are cases—like the roundabout in my electorate of Tangney—that have taken nearly 2½ years to be announced and actioned. Local governments shoulder the responsibility for approximately 77 per cent of the road network, yet it only collects around 3.5 per cent of the total tax revenue raised by governments in Australia. This financial imbalance highlights the heavy reliance of local governments on funding from other levels of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments in the guidelines represent a substantial shift towards making the program more accessible and responsive to the needs of local communities. It is true that not all councils are created equal in terms of resources. Rural and regional councils, with their lower rate bases, may find it challenging to meet the stringent criteria for the Black Spot Road Safety Program. These councils are the lifeblood of our regional communities, and we must ensure they have the support needed to make their roads safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amending the Black Spot Road Safety Program guidelines is not merely a matter of convenience; it's a matter of life and death, and our collective safety should be a non-negotiable priority. Let us work together to make this a real thing.</span>

                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  Each year far too many Australians die on our roads. These Australians are just going about their lives, whether going to work or coming home to be with their families. In the 12 months that ended June 2023, 1,205 people died on Australian roads. That is an unacceptably high number and highlights the critical need for action to improve road safety across this country. Such an effort requires cooperation at the federal, state and local levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the elected representative for the largest electorate in Australia, it would come as no surprise to those in the chamber that I am too often confronted with harrowing stories within my own electorate of Durack. This year alone, in Western Australia, we have seen 105 road fatalities. This matches the 105 road fatalities that occurred last year up to the same date. Fifty-four of the 105 road fatalities have occurred in regional Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Spot Road Safety Program is a longstanding program aimed at combating the risk of serious accidents. The program has been delivered continuously since the first year of the Howard government and delivers an ongoing commitment of approximately $110 million per annum. The program invests in projects that reduce the risk of accidents occurring, like constructing roundabouts at dangerous intersections or adding overtaking lanes in problem areas. By targeting these locations where crashes are occurring or are at risk of occurring, the program saves the community many times the cost of relatively minor road improvements. The results of this program are unquantifiable, but it has no doubt saved so many families from unnecessary heartache and pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the success of the program, I am concerned that the current structure of its guidelines is not best suited to addressing the growing problem of road safety in regional WA, and it really does need some attention. Currently, nominations for blackspot locations are invited year round, but I believe there is too much reliance on local governments to make applications. It is noteworthy that locally controlled roads account for approximately 77 per cent of total road length in Australia, yet local governments only collect around 3.5 per cent of the total tax revenue raised by Australian governments. Fifty-two per cent of all road casualties and 40 per cent of all road deaths occur on locally controlled roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, there are over 40 local government authorities. Some of these LGAs have only a few hundred people living within them; therefore, they simply do not have the rate base to support resources to develop detailed blackspot applications. Given that many road deaths occur in regional parts of the country, whereby local governments may not have the resources to make an application under the current system, I would ask the government to consider adjusting the guidelines in order to make it easier for such applications to be made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of concern I have with the current Black Spot Program is that the money being allocated to improve road safety is so far underspent. This year we've only seen the data released for Victoria and South Australia, but unfortunately we are seeing a pattern emerging. In Victoria, there was an underspend of $5.5 million, and in South Australia there was an underspend of $2.9 million—totally unacceptable. Now, we know the situation has not improved, as we are well off track to achieve the National Road Safety Strategy target of a 50 per cent reduction in road deaths by 2030. So again I stress that real attention needs to be given as to why the program is being undersubscribed and that consideration needs to be given to those regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just the Black Spot Program that is designed to improve road safety. Many infrastructure projects are also at risk now as part of Labor's 90-day infrastructure review, which has now surpassed 130 days. So it appears that the transport minister not only isn't able to tell us how she made the decision to block Qatar Airways but also isn't telling us which important infrastructure projects, especially in my electorate of Durack, which are aimed at improving safety and productivity, are important enough to go ahead. Currently there is $180 million being held up by the current transport minister. So to the minister: get on with it. Make the decisions to make sure our roads are safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I am very pleased to be able to speak on the importance of the black spot road safety program, which has been delivering funding continuously for nearly 30 years to reduce the risk of road crashes. It's one of the many funding programs by the federal government that recognises that few councils have the resources on their own to keep their roads maintained or improved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury there are more than 2,000 kilometres of roads to look after. And, of course, those roads have been smashed in recent years by fire, heavy rains, storms and floods. So the Commonwealth investment in these local government areas goes well beyond black spot funding. There has been hundreds of billions of dollars of roads repairs required across Macquarie. They are still underway. That is funded by the joint federal New South Wales disaster funding arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, beyond that, significant programs have been brought in to improve roads. For instance, under phase 4 of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, councils like Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury received allocations of $869,000 in the mountains and just over $1 million in the Hawkesbury. However, the Albanese government recognised there were extra needs for regions like ours, and an additional half a million dollars was allocated to Blue Mountains and an additional $627,000 was added to Hawkesbury. That's substantial additional funding, recognising what our community has been through. The Hawkesbury Council is finalising the list of roads that it will rehabilitate or seal, thanks to my 2022 election commitment of $11.2 million in road funding. The Blue Mountains commitment was $12.5 million, and I look forward to the announcements on the long list of roads that will be improved thanks to that allocation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These things are on top of the very key Black Spot Program, which is providing $110 million a year to fund measures right across the country improving road safety and saving lives. We know that projects delivered through black spot funding reduce serious crashes by an average of 30 per cent. Nominations are considered each year by the relevant state or territory black spot consultative panel, which is made up of representatives from community, road user groups, industry, Australian and local government, and state road and transport agencies. The panels provide the opportunity for stakeholders to have a say in the project selection process, ensuring that nominations of the highest priority and importance to the local community are recommended. As those opposite are aware, sites can be nominated by councils, the state road authorities, individuals and community organisations. Anyone can jump on and nominate a road for black spot funding. Last year's black spot funding included several key improvements for my community, with $820,000 for two sections of Old Bathurst Road in Blaxland and $1.1 million for St Albans Road. Both of these will save lives.</span>

It was my pleasure to drop in myself recently to hear of the incredible work they're doing in the youth mental health space. Now, while I was probably the least cool person in the park—sorry!—I was still inspired by the important work and programs being done on youth engagement by Al Taylor and Shannon Dale. Al and Shannon have worked in youth mental health for many, many years and are really at the coalface. They are working with our young people right across the region. While skating is fun, it also acts as a vehicle to allow for self-focus, mindfulness and safe discussions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Al's Skate Co runs a range of programs for young people, parents who want to skate with their kids, defence kids, refugee groups and school groups. It also provides outreach skating events. Recently the Skate Co team launched <span style="font-style:italic;">How We Survive</span>, a raw and honest documentary which breaks down the stigma of mental ill-health. I could not have been more impressed by the care and commitment to our young people at Al's Skate Co. I congratulate Al, Shannon and their team for their terrific work and I thank all those young people who were so friendly to me. They tried to get me on a skateboard. While I think I'm generally a pretty well-balanced person, I didn't show it on that particular day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These places are all about normalising those discussions, making connections and supporting our young people as they struggle with life's great challenges. And many of them did, indeed, have great challenges through the COVID lockdown, particularly those kids on the border and those kids who faced terrible outcomes after the bushfires. So thanks again to Al's Skate Co. I had a marvellous time. Well done on your work.</span>

It was the first festival since the COVID pandemic, the last being held in 2019. It was an opportunity for families to enjoy a local day out, with rides, food stalls, petting zoos and even a mermaid. The energy on the day was incredible, and we were blessed with beautiful weather and an amazing turnout. Thank you to everyone who stopped by my stall for a chat and showed a keen interest in their community.</span>

This will be his last South West Festival as principal of Thomas Hassall Anglican College. Ross is retiring at the end of this year, after 16 years of dedication and service to both the school and our wider community. It has been my pleasure to work with Mr Whelan during my time as a local representative. I wish him and his family well as they embark on the next phase of their lives. He has had a positive impact on so many students during his teaching career, and I look forward to working with the incoming principal, Mrs Karen Easton.</span>

I'll be voting 'yes' and here's why. First Nations people are the experts on First Nations policy. When they give advice governments must, and should, listen and act. There is significant work yet to be done in our country to repair the historical and ongoing harms of colonisation which First Nations people experience to this day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people continue to see disproportionally higher rates of incarceration, deaths in custody and the removal of children from their homes, while their communities face significantly poorer health and education outcomes. Multiple First Nations advisory bodies have been defunded or closed in the past. We need a consistent advisory body so that First Nations people can contribute to the matters that directly affect them. This is a chance to advance justice and equality, truth and treaty and voice, to step towards a future where First Nations people are respected, listened to and have the power to make decisions about their own lives.</span>

I've already signed up to volunteer with the Yes23 campaign and will continue to be out in Brisbane speaking with residents and campaigning in the lead-up to the vote. I encourage everyone who wants to see positive change in our community to sign up and get involved as well.</span>

The top five fee-free fields of study at the North Metro TAFE are nursing, education support, early childhood education, IT programming and cybersecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Metro TAFE also leads the way in skills development for our green energy future, building capacity across training in solar, wind, electric vehicles, hydrogen and battery storage technology. With $3.2 million from the TAFE Technology Fund, the Midland TAFE is set to become a renewable energy trades training centre with wind turbines and a working at heights training tower to be installed to deliver courses in vertical rescue, hazard awareness and renewable energy storage. This adds to Midland's existing expertise in training Western Power and Horizon Power employees to install and maintain standalone power systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the nearby METRONET Trade Training Centre, North Metro TAFE has trained over 3,000 students over the 2022-23 period in qualifications to support the rail sector, including electrical rail signalling, rail infrastructure and construction and maintenance of rail track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the students, educators, administrators and support staff at Midland's North Metro TAFE: congratulations. Continue the incredible work that you're doing educating the students of our future.</span>

On top of everything that cancer takes, the loss of one's hair during treatment is devastating. Each strand that falls can have a profound impact on one's sense of identity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2014 volunteers Mandy Wilding and Heather Larnach opened the doors of the Daffodil Wig Library in Bathurst. Since then, the pair have supported almost 1,000 women undergoing cancer treatment or facing conditions such as alopecia and stress to look in the mirror and feel like themselves again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The salon, run entirely on donations, has grown from stocking 30 wigs to about 400 and provides each client with a free scalp treatment formulated by the team at Capital Chemist, Bathurst, and kindly labelled by Central Commercial Printers. This is thanks to the tremendous support of residents in the Bathurst community, like Harold Colley, who organised several Shearing For A Cause fundraisers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2019, Vanessa Pringle and her team, featuring Kym Westwood, Tracy Honeysett, Anna Smith and Amanda Stapleton, have sold thousands of bunches of daffodils at their Yellow Day drive through, while the crew at the Brilliant St Cafe in Bathurst, led by Georgia Bennett, have also been extremely generous.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dedicated volunteers and supporters of the Daffodil Wig Library demonstrate that together we can make the weight of a diagnosis a little lighter and the day-to-day lives of cancer patients a little brighter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I was blessed to join the Hindu community at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan temple in celebrating Krishna Janmashtami last evening. Janmashtami celebrates the birth anniversary of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu, who descended onto the earth to uphold righteousness in the face of evil. Lord Krishna is significant to Hinduism, particularly for his role in narrating The Bhagavad Gita, which is often considered a synthesis of various aspects of Hindu philosophy. Yesterday's celebrations were incredibly joyous. As a part of the festivities, devotees participated in grand rituals, collective prayers and making offerings to Lord Krishna.</span>

BAPS is engaged with the broader community through a wide array of activities which focus on spiritual living, selfless service to humanity, cherishing culture and developing ourselves as individuals.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Over the weekend just passed, the prowess of the Mornington Peninsula's sporting women was on full and fabulous display. I had the pleasure to meet with the President of the Peninsula Surfriders Club, Sean McDevitt, at the East Coast Cash Competition at Shoreham Beach, and cheer on our local competing champions. The event featured club participants from all over the state, competing for a $1,000 prize, each for best male talent and best female talent.</span>

She is currently ranked third in Australia in under-16 women surfers. I also met other talented female surfers like Rose Holland, Sophie Wilkinson and Ruby Armstrong, all aged between 11 and 15.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Somerville Senior Netball A and C grade girls also won their grand finals over the weekend. Waves Junior Football Club, who I visited a few weeks ago, have two teams playing in the upcoming grand final in the under-11s and under-15s. Waves junior footy also had two previous female players graduate to the AFLW. Somerville junior footy club's under-13 girls were valiantly defeated in a preliminary final, but the fearless Pumas under-15 girls are playing in their grand final this weekend, and we wish them all the best of luck.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  The Philippines-Australia Multicultural Association, or PAMA, invited me to celebrate SpringFest 2023 with them at Springfield Central in my electorate. As well as PAMA president, Jomar Nieva, and secretary, Warren Grainger, we were joined by other dignitaries, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the state MP for Jordan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Filipino community contributes immeasurably to the life of Ipswich in education, sport, business and culture. If you visited my own Baptist church at Brassall or the Catholic church at Springfield, you're bound to see a large Filipino contingent of worshippers. That presence extends beyond Ipswich. Up in my electorate in the Somerset region, many are working in meat processing. If 40 people in the Somerset region become Australian citizens on a given day, it's very likely 30 or more will have come from the Philippines. There are more than 300,000 people across Australia who were born in the Philippines and many more have Filipino ancestry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">SpringFest is a melting pot of food, music, dance and art that contributes to cultural understanding and cooperation. It's something that many community organisations aspire to. SpringFest was very well timed with the Prime Minister meeting with President Marcos in Manila just two days before. There are many contributions that we make together as countries. I thank the Filipino community in Ipswich for organising an amazing SpringFest. It demonstrates the friendship our two countries share. Ipswich is the fastest-growing city in Queensland, and the Filipino community is contributing to it.</span>

Since 2000, the Gold Coast Community Fund has raised $4.5 million for those that need a helping hand with their grocery bills, their educational needs but also, during COVID-19, if I think back to that time, they were very generous in working with my office to help community centres keep their doors open by paying their electricity bills. On Friday morning, we gathered for breakfast at the Gold Coast Turf Club to raise funds for the Gold Coast Community Fund. We had Gerry Harvey and Katie Page on stage as the hilarious guest speakers, and they helped to raise over $200,000 from our community on the Gold Coast, as I said, to help those who need a hand up. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  On Saturday, I had the absolute delight in attending the 60th anniversary of the Ulladulla Milton Lions Club, held at the Mollymook Surf Life Saving Club. What a celebration it was. It's easy to see the love for the Ulladulla Milton Lions Club and what this club has achieved, together with other service clubs and organisations, for the benefit of the Milton Ulladulla community. Around 150 people attended this event. They came from Ulladulla Milton Lions—current members, past members, children of past members—other Lions clubs, local service clubs, volunteer organisations and schools. The Ulladulla Milton Lions Club have raised and donated a huge $1.495 million to the community over the last 10 years. They return this money to support many community causes and volunteer groups. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these major projects has been the establishment of Jindelara Cottage, a respite cottage for people with a disability. They are now onto the next stage of the Jindelara project, establishing independent living units for people with a disability, and I'm proud to have secured $638,000 to support this next stage. The Lions Preloved Bookshop at Ulladulla has now raised over $900,000 and exchanged 96,000 books. Members have sold over 15,000 sausage sandwiches. Their Christmas decals brighten the Christmas spirit. The Ulladulla Milton club members are simply amazing. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  Noosa resident Carla Papac is a 25-year-old ironwoman making waves in and out of the surf. Carla's dedication is unmatched as the reigning champion of the Coolangatta Gold, the iconic five-hour, 42-kilometre endurance race. Carla trains up to four hours daily, and even six hours on her days off, but her commitment doesn't end when she comes off the sand. As an exercise physiologist with Noosa Physiotherapy Centre, she's helping others to be their best also. Carla clinched her first national title in 2016 and has since represented Australia and been a stalwart on the Nutri-Grain ironperson series for three consecutive years. Away from competition, Carla is a trailblazer in her female health education role, through her co-founded venture, Woman Performance, leveraging her understanding of female physiology. </span>

Come on, corporate Australia, supporting this amazing woman isn't just giving a top Aussie athlete a helping hand; it makes great business sense. To the business world: Carla Papac needs and deserves a sponsor that matches her determination and Aussie spirit. Join her journey and sponsor Carla Papac. </span>

The Eco Warriors are a group of students committed to reducing the environmental footprint of Kincumber Public School. To date, they have coordinated successful environmental initiatives, including rubbish collections, new bins to dispose of organics, recycling and landfill, and better organisation of reusable containers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was exciting meeting with each of these students and listening about their work. I thoroughly I enjoyed answering their questions on important topics like microplastics in our oceans, shark nets, renewable energy and a range of other complex matters. The knowledge shown by each of these students is a testament to the teachers of Kincumber Public School, who do everything they can to ensure the students are given the best education possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to receiving regular updates from The Eco Warriors on their upcoming initiatives like Trash Free Tuesday, scrunch bins and minimising plastics in the school more broadly. To the brilliant students involved with The Eco Warriors at Kincumber Public School: Beau, Joseph, Connor, Julian, India, Billie and Lola—well done and please keep up your marvellous work preserving our environment on the Central Coast. I also say thank you so much to the incredibly passionate teacher, Kylie Stafford. You are an inspiration to not only the students but to the community, more broadly, right across the Central Coast.</span>

Last month, the Minister for the Environment and Water visited South Australia and informed South Australians and other basin communities that she was going to meet the 450 target. She was going to do it using buybacks, despite having told river communities during the election campaign that they were safe with her and that she wouldn't use buybacks. That announcement took place on the banks of a river—the River Murray, you would expect. No—it was the Torrens River in Adelaide, wasn't it? Wrong river, Minister! She didn't have the guts to come to a river community and tell them that she was going to rip the guts out of that community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have the guts, Minister, to come to Renmark. Go interstate to Mildura, Griffith or Shepparton. Visit these communities and understand what you're going to do to them, because an irrigation community without water is a desert. The member for Boothby, who is sitting opposite, should travel to the Riverland—it's close to her electorate—and have a think about who produces the fruit and vegetables that she wants her constituents to buy. The reality is that you're condemning them to a future of buying foreign fruit and vegetables while farmers are being pushed off the land. If you think you're getting away with this, think again!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  September is Blood Cancer Awareness Month, and I want to acknowledge the great work done by the Leukaemia Foundation. The foundation helps Hunter residents with blood cancer who need to travel and access treatment. If they need a life-saving stem cell transplant, this means staying in Sydney for 100 days post transplant. The foundation has accommodation sites in both Newcastle and Sydney, as well as a transport program to support this access. They also have a dedicated blood cancer support coordinator based in Newcastle with a regional remit to provide wraparound care for patients in the Hunter electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2020, the foundation has provided almost 10,000 nights accommodation to patients from the Hunter electorate who have needed to travel for treatment, saving these patients thousands of dollars for which they would otherwise have been out of pocket. One young woman in my electorate recently shared her story with me. Lyndell Wills is a bone marrow transplant recipient. Lyndell was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome in 2015 and acute myeloid leukaemia in 2017. When she travelled to Sydney for treatment, she had to leave behind her chickens, her cat and her two dogs to be looked after by her family and friends. Lyndell received a transplant in December 2017 and spent three months recovering at Westmead Leukaemia Foundation patient accommodation centre.</span>

This important program is close to my heart and important to the parliament, but I will leave it to Lieutenant Abbey Cooper from my beloved Royal Australian Corps of Signals, whom I hosted, to describe the importance of the program in her own words: 'This exchange program was an incredible insight into how decisions at the highest level are made. We had a bipartisan briefing at many times throughout the program, particularly on issues related to defence, tours of each house. We attended committee meetings and met with all sorts of famous faces'—including my own!—'as well as those doing vital work behind the scenes. I would thoroughly recommend the exchange to all of my colleagues in uniform and to each of the members and senators in this place.' Lieutenant Cooper concludes by saying, 'I thank them for having us in their house, and I look forward to seeing them in ours.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you would know, Deputy Speaker Young, I am extremely passionate about supporting our veterans and our current serving members, and this program is just one way that we do that. I encourage all of my colleagues in this place to consider hosting a service member in next year's Australian Defence Force parliamentary exchange program.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  It's been a busy few weeks in the Aston electorate. I was recently invited to visit Knox InfoLink, in Boronia. This organisation has been servicing the local community for 32 years. They offer a wide range of help to those in need, from emergency food relief to housing support and their weekday community breakfast program. The wonderful people like Penny and Anne at Knox InfoLink run a fantastic breakfast session each weekday to assist those in the community who might be experiencing homelessness or financial stress, and they do a brilliant job of ensuring people in these situations feel welcome and a part of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very concerned, however, to hear that Knox City Council have not increased Knox InfoLink's funding in eight years. As it was explained to me, the cost to provide these services has increased and, without this extra funding, they will have to cut staff and also cut a day of the breakfast program, which will have a huge impact on the local community. It is disappointing to hear, also, that Knox City Council have been slowly cutting other services in the area—from no longer providing personal care services under the Commonwealth Home Support Program to, most recently, reducing council run kindergarten programs. The latter decision is leaving families with fewer options for their children's early education, and kinder staff are losing their jobs. I will be raising the community's concerns with the council CEO, the mayor and councillors on the importance of these vital services for our community in the upcoming quarterly meeting.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I recently attended the Australian War Widows Queensland branch Friendship Day event at the Redlands RSL in Cleveland. It was a wonderful afternoon of fellowship and friendship, and was well attended by Australian War Widow members from across South-East Queensland—including the national president, Jenny Gregory. The event was followed by a white-cross service at Cleveland's Anzac Park. It was a privilege to be amongst so many tireless women who continue to focus on addressing the issues affecting all war and defence widows and families across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our war widows aren't a historical memory; they are an important part of Australia's societal fabric. One of the biggest priorities for the Australian War Widows is to continue the momentum to establish a national war widows day annually on 19 October. This date is the birthdate of Jessie Vasey OBE CBE, the founder of Australian War Widows. Mrs Vasey's tireless advocacy for the widows of the Second World War led to considerable breakthroughs in government support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland became the first state in Australia to recognise War Widows Day in 2022, and New South Wales has followed suit. The official recognition of War Widows Day in these jurisdictions helps to honour the sacrifices of war widows and highlights the ongoing challenges they face in their daily lives. I strongly encourage the federal government to learn from the success of the initiative in Queensland and New South Wales and take the largely symbolic action of formally recognising 19 October.</span>

The survey came in after there had been a number of anecdotal issues raised by students across the country, and the results of the survey are truly shocking. The results showed more than 50 per cent of Jewish university students hide their identity on campus, that 64 per cent have experienced some form of antisemitism on campus and that one in five Jewish students avoid campus altogether to avoid antisemitism. Eighty-five per cent of Jewish students who had experienced antisemitism did not report their incident to the university as they believed the university wouldn't take it seriously and wouldn't make a difference.</span>

This morning we were joined by Alissa Foster, the national president of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students; Jeremy Leibler, from the Zionist Federation of Australia; and others. We met with the Minister for Education, and I was pleased to be joined by the member for Berowra and the member for Wentworth, my co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of IHRA.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Right across the weekend in Hinkler we saw finals everywhere, in particular at the netball. As a former netball dad I know just how many parents are out with their kids. Those kids were out having a great time playing sport, and they had some wonderful results. It's also an opportunity for clubs to recognise those individuals who have spent decades assisting, volunteering their time and doing what's necessary to make sure their club functions and runs well and all the things parents and others do to help out their local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those individuals recognised was Sharyn Batt from Bundaberg, who became a life member of Bundy Netball. Sharyn commenced playing netball at eight years of age—as a nipper, would you believe?—including playing rep as a Bundaberg junior, apart from some time she spent in Brisbane, which happens to a lot of us who live in the regions. Sharyn, on two occasions, has taken the Bundaberg rep team to victory, winning the state titles in Queensland. She also coached the div 2 winners on the weekend—congratulations to the Across the Waves red team! I'm told I've got to get the right one. There are a number of them. Sharyn had been shortlisted previously at the 2023 Netball Queensland Awards as teacher of the year and previously a finalist as coach of the year. Amongst all of that, she's a proud parent, a proud netball mum and a teacher at Walkervale State School. I'm sure every single one of her children is exceptionally proud.</span>

At the 2022 election, Labor promised to invest in schools, and we have indeed delivered on that promise through the Schools Upgrade Fund. A total of $218,000 has been awarded to nine schools in the electorate of Swan. This round of the Schools Upgrade Fund provides $32 million to schools nationwide, and we are seeing these benefits in the heart of Swan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">High Wycombe Primary School, which is in my electorate, will soon commence work to upgrade its school. I recently had the opportunity to visit this fabulous primary school. It is a school that is high in community spirit. High Wycombe Primary School is a 60-year-old primary school, and it shows. Investment in schools was neglected under the previous government, but the money under the Schools Upgrade Fund will be used for much-needed and overdue upgrades. I see firsthand the work being done under this grant.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The acting school principal, Stacey, told me how delighted she was to receive the grant. She explained that it's easy to learn in a clean and fresh environment. Freshening up tired areas of the school will encourage student learning, and High Wycombe Primary School students are so excited to do this. I had the opportunity to play chess with them recently, and they are very intelligent students.</span>

The feedback that I'm receiving on the ground is that the government's decision to ban live sheep export is already having a catastrophic effect. I've heard firsthand that export markets are now having second thoughts on trading with Australian sheep producers due to the uncertainty caused by the Albanese government. But it isn't just those who are involved in the export trade who are suffering. Farmers who supply the domestic sheep market are also facing hardship due to the increased domestic supply. The price per head domestically has fallen so much that, for some, the cost of transporting lambs to a local abattoir has been more than the amount offered per head. This means farmers are being forced to put down their sheep just to bury them. As you can imagine, this is heartbreaking. As WoolProducers Australia president, Steve Harrison, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the groups that came to Canberra last week to advocate for the sheep industry and educate parliamentarians. Thanks to WAFarmers, WoolProducers Australia, Sheep Producers Australia, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia and the National Farmers Federation. I want to put on record that there were Labor members of this place who accepted the invitation to hear directly how their policy is hurting WA farmers. Shame on them for not showing up to the meeting!</span>

We are 8½ years down the track and we have Senate estimates to thank for now finding out that the government has spent $108 million on this project. I'm not sure if this actually includes the hundreds and thousands of hours that the department has worked on the project, but it is $108 million, nonetheless. Given the fact that the project had strong community support, that it was situated on freehold land that had, of course, fully extinguished native title rights and that the government had bought the land, you can understand how the community could be forgiven for thinking that this project was actually going to proceed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimba was promised 45 permanent jobs, the construction of a $300-plus million facility, an $8 million fund—to be offered in four tranches for the development of local capacity—and a $20 million trust fund to advance the community. The local government and businesses within the town had made business decisions based on the fact that this facility was going ahead. People had bought property in the area based on the fact that this project was going ahead. The Kimba council has written in response to Minister King and has asked her to honour the community benefits package—the $8 million in four tranches and the $20 million trust fund—and I am throwing my weight behind that request. The least they could do is show some respect to this community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I rise to recognise the remarkable achievements of IronBark Hill Brewing Co at the recent Independent Brewers Association's Indies awards. These awards honour excellence in the brewing industry and recognise the innovative and creative spirits that drive the independent brewing community. Once again, the Hunter has risen above the pack, with our very own IronBark Hill Brewing Co taking home 13 medals at the awards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the packaged and draft beer categories, IronBark Hill won gold and silver medals for their Black Forest stout, a delicious drop brewed with English hops, Australian ale malt, chocolate malt, roasted barley, fresh pureed cherries and real dark chocolate that was added late into the fermentation to create an indulgent chocolate treat that reminds you of a Black Forest cake. They picked up silver medals for their Old Nessie, an 8.2 per cent Scottish strong ale, their summer ale and their Night Sky dark lager. They also picked up bronze medals for their Tickled Pink XPA, their American pale ale, their Far Canal lager and their Level Up India pale lager.</span>

These awards are recognition of your passion for, dedication to and skills in your craft. I look forward to bending the elbow and sharing a couple of frothies with you soon to celebrate your success.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  On this day 22 years ago the world stopped. The world changed forever. We all remember where we were on 9/11 when we saw the tragic news and we heard how many lives had been taken and how many lives had been lost. On 29 April this year I went to the 9/11 Memorial at the World Trade Center site in New York. I was moved—very moved—by what I saw there, particularly when I saw the name of Rahma Salie and her unborn child. It brings home just how tragic an event this was.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians Kevin Dennis, Alberto Dominguez, Elisa Ferraina, Craig Gibson, Peter Gyulavary, Yvonne Kennedy, Andrew Knox, Lesley Thomas, Stephen Tompsett and Leanne Whiteside lost their lives on that day. And, of course, it plunged us into wars in Iraq, where two Australians were lost, and Afghanistan, our longest-ever conflict, where 46 lives that are now remembered at the Australian War Memorial were lost. Such a tragedy and so unnecessary. We should always remember that the price of peace is eternal vigilance. We mourn for those who were lost, who were taken so unfairly, so tragically and so quickly on that fateful day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  A few short weeks ago I was joined in my electorate of Spence by Senator Marielle Smith and the Assistant Minister for Education, Senator Anthony Chisholm, to visit Playford College for Book Week. Playford College is a fantastic school located in Elizabeth in the very heart of Spence. Prior to our arrival for the Book Week festivities that morning, we stopped for a coffee at the Hopestreet Cafe &amp; Op Shop, which is located in Davoren Park. This is a cafe that gives back to the community by training and upskilling many young people in our community with retail skills and barista qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon arriving at Playford College, we were given a very warm welcome by staff and students alike. Book Week is truly a magical time of the year. It doesn't matter how young or old you may be, it engenders our love for reading—and helps to reinvigorate the passion for some of us who have been reading one too many committee reports or explanatory memoranda as of late! It was a pleasure to read through such books as <span style="font-style:italic;">Jigsaw:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">A Puzzle </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span> by Bob Graham, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Koala Ark</span> by Stephen Michael King. I'd particularly like to thank Playford College's principal, Chris Riemann; and the literacy coordinator, Samantha Collins, for their invitation to enjoy such a fantastic morning with their school. It truly was remarkable. There was a really good impromptu interview by young kids. A lot of fun was had by all.</span>

It has been fantastic to be able to visit a number of games in the football and netball leagues. This weekend we had mixed results from a Deakin electorate perspective. A very good win for Mitcham over South Belgrave. Commiserations to my good friend the member for Casey. Mitcham got over the line by five points in the division 1 grand final.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another premiership, congratulations to Matt McCubbin and all the team at the Mitcham Football Club for building a phenomenal club. To have won a division 1 premiership is fantastic. Commiserations to the Heathmont footy club, who went down yesterday to Boronia. It was a very valiant performance to even make it to the grand final, given some of the trials and tribulations during the season. It's so wonderful that they got there. It was also good for me to get along to the Vermont preliminary final, where they beat Doncaster East. Vermont will be flying the flag for the Deakin electorate in the grand final this Saturday. The powerhouse that Vermont is, we are all hoping that they can get over the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A shout out to all of the volunteers at the home grounds that make it happen in our area. The Mitcham footy club hosted the finals at Walker Park. It's a huge effort for our volunteers. A few weeks ago I was on the barbecue with the Ringwood Football Club, who were hosting the finals at Jubilee Park. There are literally dozens of volunteers who make these things happen for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  When my plane touched down in Canberra last night there was fabulous news awaiting me. In a nail-biting game, my beloved Newcastle Knights had beaten the Canberra Raiders in the first home final game in almost 20 years. The sold-out game saw 29,548 people packing the Newcastle stadium. I can only imagine the levels of celebration that would have taken place last night. It added to an already thrilling weekend for the Knights, with the women's team defeating the Roosters at home on Saturday, bringing them to the top of the ladder. The women take on Wests Tigers on Thursday night before heading into the finals next week, and the men take on New Zealand in Wellington on Saturday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been an avid Knights fan since their inception in 1988. I fondly remember our premiership wins in 1997 and 2001, and the five final matches hosted between 1998 and 2006. But Novocastrians are not fickle fans. We have been there through the dark times as well, when those wins were few and far between, which makes these finals series all the more delicious. I am beyond excited by the prospect of both our mighty Knights teams, the men and the women, being on the paddock for these finals. I say: go, Knights! You do us proud.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I wish to express my condolences to the family and fellow volunteers of Leonie Turner, long-time CFA captain of the Hoddles Creeks Fire Brigade. Leonie's sudden passing in July this year has left a hole in the Hoddles Creek and wider Yarra Valley community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leonie has been described as a calm and caring leader—but far from a pushover—who led the brigade with great strength during times of disaster, and she saw her fair share of them. She received the National Emergency Medal in 2014 and, again, this year for her service at significant fire events across Victoria throughout the past 10 years. She also received the CFA life membership, for 30 years of service, this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her CFA involvement began back in 1992 with the Yarra Junction Fire Brigade, before moving over to Hoddles Creek years later. She was also a dedicated member of the AV Yarra Junction Ambulance Auxiliary, who helped fundraise and worked hard for a new station in the Upper Yarra. Leonie set up the Hoddles Creek emergency catering crew, which provides food and refreshments to CFA, police, SES and emergency personnel when they are out on the front line. She believed in the next generation of firefighters, having led the junior member program for the entire Yarra Valley, with many of those juniors now holding senior roles. She leaves a legacy in our community that will never be forgotten. Vale, Leonie Turner.</span>

That's four times the size of the ACT. A total fire ban has been extended today for another 24 hours across the Northern Territory. Extreme fire weather is being forecast for the remainder of the week. A watch-and act-emergency warning has been issued for Tennant Creek. Emergency services have warned against any unnecessary travel into the Barkly region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge—as the member for Lingiari has already done—the hard work and dedication of our firefighters and all emergency service workers at this difficult time; that's full-time volunteer firies, Bushfires NT and all firies in the Northern Territory. My brother is a firefighter in Darwin, and my uncle, in Melbourne, was a firefighter for 40 years. Fires are incredibly ferocious and dangerous things, so I appreciate the dangers and challenges endured by our first responders, including my nephew, Clancy, who is an ambulance officer. We owe them a great deal. I also recognise the work of community organisations and members along the way. It's a very difficult time. These fires have led to highway closures. Let's give them all the support that we can.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridging the intergenerational divide is one of the defining issues in this defining decade, and that means addressing two critical questions. One is on climate justice and the other is on housing affordability and access for Australians. These are two issues that were brought to my attention during the campaign, and they are still live issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the climate action front, our energy transformation is well underway. That is evidenced by the fact that we have gone from 33 per cent renewable energy last year to 40 per cent this year as we accelerate to 82 per cent in 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing, however, is a much more complex issue and one that we inherited due to a decade of inaction under those opposite. They essentially vacated the space. We understand that housing is foundational to Australians. It is foundational to our security and wellbeing. There is simply no opportunity to progress either economically or socially without a roof over one's head. However, new housing dwellings actually peaked in 2016 and have been declining ever since. Powerful demographic shifts have happened in that period of time. We've seen an increase in the population. We've also seen, since the COVID pandemic, a shift towards households of smaller size, and we've seen a new generation of young people who have now grown up and are wanting, justifiably, to live in places that are near to their work. So we have essentially created a perfect storm—the lowest level of social and affordable housing we've seen in a decade. A decade ago it was 4.8 per cent, and it is now 4.1 per cent. It was actually Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was then axed by the Abbott government in 2014. A lot of those homes have been retired since then, and it has only added acutely to the housing shortage we have inherited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the Albanese government understands that the cure for renters who are facing plunging vacancy rates and surging rents—they've increased at least 14 per cent in Melbourne in the year until March of this year. The cure for homeless Australians—and, according to the 2021 census, there were at least 122,000 Australians who were homeless. The cure for workers, particularly women and children, fleeing domestic violence and the cure for those at risk of homelessness, those workers who are in precarious jobs—loopholes that we are trying to address in the lower house. The cure for all these groups is actually supply, and that is something we in the Albanese government are laser focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is evidenced also by my own community members who attended a housing roundtable with the housing minister. These are some of the things they said: 'You can walk through any major shopping strip and there are homeless people begging for money. These people, it would appear, have multiple problems. If we could improve these people's lives and get them secure housing, we would all benefit.' I am concerned about the level of homelessness in Higgins, and I have seen it worsen over the last five years. The ongoing housing crisis in Australia is a pressing and urgent matter, with thousands of people, families and single mothers and the elderly struggling to find affordable housing. We hear these calls, and this is why we have a broad and sweeping housing agenda, which comes at a problem of this magnitude from different angles, as it should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have stretched out our National Housing Accord target to 1.2 million homes that will be well located and funded from 2024 onwards. We have brought together institutional investors and all three tiers of government to solve this problem. We recently announced the $3 billion new homes bonus to incentivise the states to build these additional 200,000 homes. We have a $500 million housing support program to ensure that we create the infrastructure, the sanitation and the roads to support these new builds. When we realised we had a surplus in the budget we announced a $2 billion social housing accelerator to build an additional 4,000 social rental homes in the next two years. And, pleasingly, today, the Prime Minister and the housing minister announced that the Housing Australia Future Fund will be passed, thanks to support from the Greens and the crossbench in the upper house. This is long overdue. It's an indictment on those opposite that they have not supported this bill, while they have the temerity to come into this House and criticise us for actually doing something on housing. That's exactly what the Albanese government has been doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  It's remarkable that the government is complaining about people being unhappy with their housing track record. It's not the people on this side who are unhappy; it's the Australian people who are unhappy. This government has failed every single objective measure of housing. First home buyers are down, not that we hear from the government about first home buyers. New home approvals are down. New home starts are down. In fact, we see now new homes being built at the lowest level since the Gillard government. At the same time as we have first home buyers down, approvals down, new home starts down and an industry that's really suffering at the moment because of the inaction of this government, we have a government that's determined to bring in 1½ million new migrants over five years with absolutely no idea where those people will live. I think most people in Australia and, indeed, in our chamber support a planned migration system, but the word 'planned' means you've got to know where on earth they're going to live.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we see the Labor salvo of this housing agenda, if you call it an agenda, being in absolute tatters. The poor old government, dancing to the tune of the Greens, have magically found $1 billion behind the cushions on the couch. They just found a lazy $1 billion as they were fossicking around, and that got the Greens over the line. Another dirty deal. One wonders why the member, who brought forward this motion, was not out there last week arguing about that extra billion dollars. She's very proud of it now. Where was she a week ago to proclaim the importance of that extra funding?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is we've got a government with absolutely no idea what they're doing on housing. They've got a hapless housing minister with no idea what's going on. We were supposed to have this so-called Help to Buy program commence on 1 January this year. It's 11 September. Where on earth is the Help to Buy program that the government took to the election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Housing Australia Future Fund was supposed to have commenced on 1 July. Yet we now see in September they finally cut a deal with the Greens, but it's late and there's absolutely no guarantee of any funding out of that fund. What do we have in exchange? We've got, as the member outlined in her contribution, an extra $2 billion—a blank cheque—that was handed to the states. To all those Australians out there: never fear, the problems have been solved. The Prime Minister did a deal with his state Labor premiers. He handed money over and guess what?</span>

The government has waved the white flag on home ownership for young Australians. They're not interested in talking about home ownership, whereas on this side of the chamber, when we were in government, we directly assisted 300,000 Australians into their first home. Whether it was through the HomeBuilder program, the Home Guarantee Scheme or the First Home Super Saver Scheme—all programs that were opposed at the time by the Labor Party, some of which have been enthusiastically adopted now because their agenda is so bereft. They have absolutely no idea. Even today their billion dollars of bribery to get the Greens over the line is an extra billion dollars in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, which I set up as housing minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  What an interesting contribution from the member for Deakin. If I were him, I would probably be hiding in shame, given my track record as the former minister for housing and homelessness. He failed to do anything in the nine years that the coalition government was in power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now in one of the most unaffordable housing positions this country has ever seen. That is because of successive governments' failure, at the federal and New South Wales state levels, to adequately plan, fund and build housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing pressures on families across my electorate are serious. There is a high proportion of renters and mortgage holders in the electorate of Reid. Around 40 per cent of renters there are experiencing rental stress. Around a quarter of mortgage holders are experiencing mortgage stress. Increases in rents and interest rates have a disproportionate impact on my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report by the Committee for Sydney found Sydney is second only to Hong Kong for housing unaffordability, with an average home costing more than 13 times the median salary. How did we get to this point? It hasn't always been this way. When my parents came to this country more than four decades ago, they worked hard and were able to buy a home in south-west Sydney five years after arriving in this country. Their story isn't unique. I met Josephina while out doorknocking. She was just 22 when she moved here from Chile with her husband and baby girl. Her and her husband worked hard, sometimes multiple jobs, and, within five years of arriving in Australia, they bought their family home in Silverwater that they still live in today. Australia's multicultural success story and the stories of my parents and Josephina's family and so many other migrant families are possible because of the stability given to them by affordable housing. But what would have happened to those migrants' stories if they had they come to this country not decades ago but today? Would my parents have been able to afford to buy a house in Sydney? I don't think so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how did we get here? A problem as big as this did not happen overnight. It has been brewing for years and years. We are here because of the decade of complete and utter failure and neglect by the federal and New South Wales coalition governments. Under their watch, we were left with a critical shortage of housing. After a decade of siloed state and territory policies where housing ministers barely met, the community rightly expects the Albanese government to get on with the job of bringing all levels of government together. While we can't fix a problem this big overnight, we are taking significant steps to help us get there. It falls to this Labor government to fix up the mess left behind by those opposite. It is up to us to build the homes and apartments this country needs, and that's exactly what we are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the best efforts of those opposite to block the housing affordability future fund, I'm pleased to see this key housing policy is set to pass the parliament. First and foremost, the housing affordability future fund is about providing the biggest boost to affordable housing in a decade, with 30,000 social and affordable homes to be built within the first five years of its establishment—secure and affordable housing for women and children fleeing family violence, for veterans and for frontline workers, nurses, paramedics, teachers. But it's not just about that; it's about providing a resilient and sustainable funding stream for social and affordable housing long into the future. I use those words very deliberately because, in all the political commentary about the housing affordability future fund, this key point might have been missed. I say we need a resilient funding stream because, by developing the community housing sector, it stops future Liberal-National governments from selling public assets like the former Liberal government did over the last decade in New South Wales, and I say 'sustainable' because it's so important to keep the supply of social housing consistent so that it can continue, whoever—Liberal or Labor—is in government, so that we are never again finding ourselves in the situation we are in now, where housing unaffordability is at record levels.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I'm pleased to speak today to support the motion of the member for Higgins. Housing should be regarded as a basic human right. But in Australia successive governments have seen housing primarily as a means towards accumulation of wealth. Both the ALP and the LNP have historically demonstrated a bias towards house price speculating investors, neglecting the needs of householders who rent and people who want to purchase the home in which they wish to live. As a result, we have some of the most expensive housing in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Expensive housing, high interest rates and soaring business costs have combined to delay when our young people can partner with others. Some report that, because of the cost of housing, they are now deferring having their first child or choosing not to have children at all. The Australian capitals—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth—rank in the least affordable urban areas in the world. Our household debt to disposable income ratio is over 200 per cent. Banks have changed most of our mortgages from 25 years to 30 years, but we've still basically priced young people out of the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before COVID, Australia had about 400 homes per 1,000 people. This was one of the lowest supplies of housing stock in the developed world. During the pandemic, the number of people per household fell sharply as people fled share houses; those working from home wanted those extra bedrooms to become offices; and the pressure of lockdowns contributed to the divorce rate jumping to a decade high. Many people continue to work from home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Oxford Economics estimates that Australia currently has a housing gap of more than 750,000 homes. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's recent <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ation</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s housing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2022-23</span> report estimated that the gap between the number of new households and additional housing supply will be more than 106,000 over the next four years. Houses currently can't be built fast enough to supply demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 1970s, Australia has consistently completed construction of between 22,000 and 29,000 homes every quarter. That actually hasn't changed over time. We just don't seem to be able to build more quickly than we are now—but we must. We also need to remove some of the constraints around building more homes in established suburbs to address chronic shortages and to allow people to live close to where they work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the rental market is very difficult. The lack of rental accommodation is profound. The number of available rentals has been at historical lows for some time now, and, in many capital cities, the vacancy rate sits below one per cent. Cost-of-living constraints are creating an enormous burden on renters. There is not enough housing to go around. Rents have nearly doubled since 1994, roughly in line with inflation, and are now rising as much as 15 per cent a year. More than half of all low-income renters are facing rent stress and half of all retirees who rent are living in poverty. In my own electorate of Kooyong, reputedly a wealthy electorate, one-third of renters and one in five mortgage holders are in financial stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government lifted the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent in May 2023. This increase was only $16 a week. It no doubt helped the 1.3 million concession card holders who received it, but it was disappointing that the Treasurer did not act on the recommendation of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee to increase the CRA in line with rents actually paid rather than the consumer price index.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need long-term planning and government ownership of this wicked problem. The provision of more social and affordable housing will reduce homelessness. It will improve productivity, increase economic growth and drive better health and income equality outcomes. We need our federal, state and local governments to work together on this most important of issues. I will continue to push this government to accelerate the supply of social and affordable housing and to provide meaningful financial support for renters and mortgage holders.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I want to thank the member for Higgins for bringing up this great motion. I am pleased to speak on one of the most pressing issues facing our nation—housing. The Albanese Labor government recognises that safe and affordable housing is not just a basic necessity; it's central to the security and dignity of all Australians. Far too many Australians are galloping with the burden of growing rents, making it increasingly difficult for them to make ends meet. The dream of owning a home has become an elusive goal for many as the barriers to entry continue to rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud the Albanese Labor government is taking firm action. We are implementing a comprehensive set of reforms aimed at ensuring every Australian has a place to call home. Over the past decade, the proportion of social housing in Australia has declined from 4.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent of all housing stock. The Albanese Labor government is unwavering in its commitment to reversing this trend and ensuring that all Australians have access to secure and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased the Albanese government reintroduced legislation to establish the Housing Australia Future Fund. This fund will provide a sustainable and ongoing source of funding to build the social and affordable homes that Australians so desperately need. What is heartening is that this legislation has garnered support from everyone in this House, except for those who are out of touch with everyday Australians, like most of the coalition. This fund will be instrumental in achieving the ambitious target we took to the last election—building 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes within the first five years of its establishment. This is the most significant boost to affordable housing in over a decade. Importantly, we ensure that these homes are distributed fairly and credibly across our great nation. They will be found not only in our cities but also in our towns, as well as in regional and remote Australia. Our efforts do not end here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also dedicated to helping Australians achieve their dream of home ownership. We inherited an economy where many Australians struggled to save a deposit and buy a home. However, we are determined to deliver solutions to fix this problem. One such solution is the Help to Buy scheme, designed to support eligible Australians on low to moderate incomes in purchasing their own home with a smaller deposit, resulting in more manageable mortgage payments. This scheme is a lifeline for up to 40,000 low- and middle-income families over four years, making home ownership a reality for those who feel locked out of the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this program, the Albanese Labor government will provide an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. We are working tirelessly to ensure that this scheme is accessible to all Australians in every state and territory. As well, states agreed at national cabinet to progress legislation to implement the scheme nationally. In fact, since the election, the Albanese government has assisted more than 67,000 Australians in achieving home ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, our recent budget announcement expanded the First Home Guarantee Scheme to include any two eligible borrowers beyond just spouse or de facto partners. It is also now available to non-first home buyers who haven't owned a property in Australia in the last 10 years, providing support to those who have faced financial crisis or relationship breakdown. Moreover, we have extended eligibility to borrowers who are single legal guardians of children, such as aunties, uncles or grandparents, in addition to single, natural and adoptive parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to building more social and affordable housing, while helping Australians achieve their home ownership dreams. We understand the challenges that many Australians face, and we are taking decisive action to ensure a brighter and more secure future for all. Together, we can provide every Australian with an opportunity to have a place to call home.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  Members of the government are keen to list the ways they're addressing the housing crisis across Australia, but I do want to put a spotlight on what is missing from this discussion on housing. That spotlight needs to go on housing in regional, rural and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Higgins. I know she cares about housing, but not once does this motion mention regional, rural or remote Australia—not once. Out of the billions of dollars of funding this government has announced, there is no dedicated, guaranteed funding for regional Australia. That includes the announcement today that the government and the Greens have agreed on a further $1 billion in immediate and direct spending in community housing through the NHIF. But, again, there is a complete blind spot when it comes to the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is despite one in three Australians living outside a major city and the housing crisis hitting hard in these areas just as much as in the major cities. In Wangaratta where I live, I see people living in caravans and tents along the river. One of these people I met—let's call him Richard—is a qualified chef. But, after mental health challenges and struggles with addiction and relationship breakdown, Richard lost his home and couldn't find anything affordable. He now lives in a tent. Sadly, all his tools of trade were recently stolen. Theoretically, Richard could walk into a job in just about any hospitality venue in north-east Victoria because they're screaming for chefs, but his housing situation has made that virtually completely impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more people like Richard, sleeping rough in tents or caravans. We know there are probably many more women who are experiencing homelessness now too, who are more likely to couch surf and stay with friends and family. Women over 55, as we know, are the fastest-growing demographic of people experiencing homelessness, and this includes women in rural, regional and remote areas. It's these men and women who drive me to keep fighting for a dedicated regional housing fund from this government. It's why today I introduced my private member's bill: the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment (Unlocking Regional Housing) Bill. This bill would allow the main government body that finances housing, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, or NHFIC, to specifically target an equitable portion of this funding at regional, rural and remote Australia. This bill also directs the NHFIC to proactively identify and support housing proponents to apply for the funding—proponents like local governments, who are often responsible, especially in regional, rural and remote areas, for funding the critical, enabling infrastructure that unlocks housing supply. But, with small ratepayer bases, regional councils often do not have the funds to deliver the poles and the power lines or the sewerage and the drainage on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Wangaratta, there's a perfect example of why my bill is needed and how it addresses these major factors in the regional housing crisis. Nestd, a not-for-profit social enterprise, are working with the Rural City of Wangaratta to deliver their vision of 200 safe, quality, energy efficient and beautiful houses for young people, pensioners and essential workers. This is the social and affordable housing this government talks about. But Nestd needs funding to clear the site, including asbestos removal. They also need to build water and sewerage infrastructure, and then get going with the building. They need funding for critical enabling infrastructure for the housing, and right now they're struggling to get funding from NHFIC. They say my bill would help open the door for them, so that Wangaratta, where homelessness has gone up a staggering 67 per cent since 2016, can get the social and affordable housing it desperately needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing about a need for a regional housing infrastructure fund, and they showed me they were starting to listen to me when they announced the $500 million Housing Support Program, which will offer payments for connecting essential services and providing amenities for new housing developments. But they only half listened, because this announcement had absolutely no guaranteed funding for the regions. As this government motions says, 'Safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians.' I can only assume that the member includes regional, rural and remote Australians in this, because so far this government have utterly failed to explicitly mention us—regional Australians—in their myriad announcements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This must change, and it must change now. We can't assume. We have to make sure. We have to make certain. We need to make the legislation explicit. I hope the next time the government lists all their housing programs, there's one with 'regional, rural and remote' in its title.</span>

                  </a>  They were male! As the member for Kooyong pointed out, we have a gap of about 750,000 dwellings at the moment. No-one can go about their life without a safe and stable place to call home where they can raise a family, go to work and stay healthy. We know how important it is for everyone to have a secure, safe roof over their heads, and Labor is more than committed to tackling the nation's housing challenges, following from nearly a decade of inaction from the former Liberal-National government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, we put an ambitious housing agenda to the Australian public. Since then, we've built on that agenda to work with and support the construction industry as we work towards that promise of significantly increasing the supply of new homes. We're doing that because all the experts tell us that supply is the answer. There are some tax things that we could go into, but supply is what we have to be focused on. A lot of people talk about social, affordable and all types of housing both in and outside of this parliament. Having formerly been on the board of Kyabra—something I had to give up when I was elected—I know how hard it is to roll out social and affordable housing. But, when it came to the crunch, when we introduced a bill in the parliament that would actually start to solve the problem, some people just said no from a party position and some people literally ran away from voting for it in the House of Reps. They're quite prepared to stand, make speeches, complain about the housing crisis and say what they would have done in their 11th year of government. If you meet with any community group or organisation that actually deals with housing and homelessness, they will tell you how frustrated they've been because of the delay in the passing of the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill. My organisations that deal with homelessness and housing on the ground really want certainty around long-term investments so that they can get those projects started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I was pleased to hear that the Greens political party and other parties in the Senate announced they're now supporting the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill, a bill that will deliver the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. It's good to see that the Greens now recognise this and will work with us to deliver more affordable housing to the Australians who need it most. Working together is the key to starting to solve this wicked housing crisis. That is the kind of parliament that Australians want to see: politicians working together in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our funding commitments in housing through the Housing Australia Future Fund, the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator—which I think is a wonderful initiative—the National Housing Infrastructure Facility and the National Housing Accord are all about new, social and affordable rental homes. These are homes that will be owned in perpetuity by the state governments or the registered community providers, and will be provided at concessional rents to key workers and people who need them most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also introducing incentives to increase the supply of rental housing by improving the arrangements for investments in build-to-rent accommodation. We know a lot of people across Australia are finding it tough to find an affordable place to rent. I hear horror story after horror story in my electorate. The last census found that more than 30 per cent of Australians were renting, and we know that we need to do so much more. This $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will create that secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental housing. That's the promise we took to the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When National Cabinet met just under a month ago, they committed to a better deal for renters and to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. Without going into boring constitutional law, we're doing what we can with the state governments that work in this area to develop a nationally consistent framework with a requirement for genuine, reasonable grounds for eviction; moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year; and phasing in minimal rental standards, among other changes, to make renting fairer, but not doing it in such a way that we're going to decrease supply and that investment supply line. These changes will make practical impacts to Australian renters. These changes will change lives and save lives. We have committed to an ambitious housing agenda reform agenda. Let's get on with it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Thank you to the member for Higgins for bringing this motion to the House. It's great to hear this afternoon that the HAFF Bill will now pass with the support of the Greens and the crossbench, securing an additional $1 billion overall in direct funding for public and community housing. It will certainly kickstart the process and enable more affordable housing to be built. This is welcome news, especially in electorates with high social and affordable housing needs such as Fowler. But we will see how fast construction will begin from this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in public housing, and I can't stress enough the importance of having a roof over our heads when we first arrived in Australia. It helped my late mother tremendously to know we had a temporary place to call home while she was working out how to raise her three daughters and acclimatise to the new country. This public housing was a stepping stone for my late mother, and from that we were able to slowly rebuild our lives. Today, my sister and I can proudly say we have worked hard to contribute back to Australia, and we are in a position to pay for our own homes. But, as we know, it is becoming harder and harder to own a home in today's economic climate. We have seen 13 interest rates rises in 15 months. We are yet to see the ramifications of that on families who are now struggling to pay for their mortgage, electricity bills, car and house insurance and groceries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing availability and affordability are at an all-time low. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics put the cost of building a house at nearly $450,000 in February this year. The same house cost just over $300,000 to build in February 2021. That's a massive increase of more than $130,000 in just two years. When speaking to business owners and ordinary people in Fowler, they're telling me everything has gone up since COVID. In a country where most of us have been raised to believe that, if we worked hard, we could one day own our own quarter-acre block in the suburbs, it's just a pipe dream. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has the fourth-worst rental affordability in Australia, where 45 per cent of families spent more than 30 per cent of household income on rent. We also have the fourth-worst mortgage affordability in Australia. Nearly 25 per cent of our households spent more than 30 per cent of their household income on repayments. While I acknowledge the housing crisis impacts every Australian, regardless of their background and postcode, I want to highlight a devastating effect of this housing crisis on people from low socioeconomic backgrounds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Fowler, 42 per cent of the community are renting. I learned recently, during a school visit, of a family being thrown out of their rental accommodation who were looking for emergency accommodation. We need to provide greater rental assistance so that families don't end up in streets. There's a huge waiting list of approximately 175,000 people wanting to access social and affordable housing. That's a large number which could mean up to a 10 year waiting period, or longer. I know for a fact that, in my electorate of Fowler, the high cost of housing forces low-income families to sometimes make difficult choices between housing, renting, food and health care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But housing development goes beyond just funding. No matter how much money you throw at the problem, you will not fix it. We need to address the construction costs—which, as I said, have gone up—workforce shortages, bureaucratic red tape for DA and planning approvals across local governments. We need to make sure these different levels of government work together to ensure a faster process to get property development happening. Therefore it's imperative that we work together. We must engage every level of the community to promote better housing outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much more that needs to be done, starting with a commitment to increase a real and sustainable investment in social and affordable housing, by working with community housing providers, developers, investors and the building industry. Social housing and affordable housing is critical, especially for families in migrant and refugee communities, and, as the member for Indi said, for regional communities as well. We need to ensure that there is targeted funding so that these communities can have a starting point for people such as my family and my mother. </span>

The Albanese government, our government, understands that Australians are facing serious housing shortages all around the country. We are also focused on addressing the economic situation that we've inherited, including the rising cost of living. We want every Australian to have the security of a roof over their head, but it is true that a decade of little action by the former coalition government has left us with significant challenges across the nation. That's why an ambitious housing agenda, such as the one we've got, is needed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All jurisdictions—including Tasmania, where there's a Liberal government—have now agreed to a $3 billion new-homes bonus to extend the National Housing Accord target to 1.2 million new homes over five years. So that's an additional 200,000 new homes above the target that was agreed by all states and territories last year. This target will be implemented through the housing support program which is a $500 million competitive funding program for local and state governments to kickstart that housing supply. In June, we announced a further $2 billion in new money to build more social housing rentals over the next two years. This is the most significant housing reform in a generation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government understands safe and affordable housing is central to the dignity of Australians. Far too many Australians are being hit by growing rents, far too many Australians are finding it too difficult to buy a home and, sadly, far too many Australians are facing or experiencing homelessness. We have now reintroduced legislation to establish the HAFF, the Housing Australia Future Fund, which will provide a sustainable and ongoing funding stream to build the social and affordable homes that Australians need. This legislation is supported by every member of this House, save for most of those in the Liberal and National parties and the Greens political party. Thank you to those members of the crossbench who supported this legislation. This fund will help deliver the ambitious target we took to the last election to build 30,000 new social and affordable homes within the first five years. Importantly, we will make sure these homes are fairly and equitably spread, including in regional and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HAFF builds on our other initiatives, such as the National Housing Accord, which will deliver 10,000 affordable homes in the five years from 2024, matched by the states with another 10,000 homes. The expansion of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility will release an additional $575 million for more social and affordable homes right now. In addition, the Social Housing Accelerator provides $2 billion to build up to 4,000 new social rentals in the next two years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, the proportion of social housing in Australia has fallen from 4.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent of all housing stock. At the exact time that we needed more social housing, those opposite have left our nation with less social housing. We are committed to turning this around. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I want to pay tribute to some organisations that are helping Territorians in my electorate and throughout the Northern Territory to find affordable housing. Champions of the sector, like CatholicCare and Anglicare, are providing invaluable work in the NT. For renters, it's a dire situation. There is a three per cent vacancy rate. In my electorate, there is a less than one per cent vacancy rate in Darwin and Palmerston. This obviously hits people on low incomes especially hard, because few of these rentals are actually affordable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge NT Shelter and its important work, and, of course, Vinnies, the St Vincent de Paul Society, for their proposal to build some interim accommodation on Crown land in Darwin, and also a proposal for more affordable housing on Westralia Street in Stuart Park. We are also committed to helping veterans at risk of homelessness and all homeless veterans through the Scott Palmer Services Centre in Darwin. That is really important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought by the member for Higgins, and I thank her for bringing this motion. I don't agree with a lot of the parts of the motion, but it concerns housing affordability. Housing costs at the moment are a key driver of the cost-of-living crisis facing Australians under this Albanese Labor government. High inflation is pushing up rents and pushing up mortgage repayments, because the RBA has been left to do all the heavy lifting on getting inflation down—whether it be the 12 interest rate rises that have seen the average Australian mortgage holder now pay $22,000 more per year than they were paying under the former coalition government, or whether it be that the average Australian renter is now playing 11½ per cent more than they were last year. To put it this way, in my electorate of Hughes the average rent on an apartment is $700 per week. If those renters were paying $700 last year, they are now paying $780 per week at least. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion speaks of safe and affordable housing being central to the safety and dignity of all Australians, and that is certainly the part of this motion that I do agree with. But there are some glaring silences in this motion. The member for Indi pointed it out when she said there is nothing here for the regions. It's also completely silent about incentivising private homeownership. When more Australians own their own homes, over decades and decades it has been proven that our economy is stronger. Private homeownership is a glaring omission from this government's housing policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing is unaffordable in this country because of a lack of housing stock—insufficient supply to meet demand. It's basic economics. I have spoken before in this place about the federal government incentivising state and local governments to bring about planning reforms, to cut the red tape and delays in rezoning and development applications. Before I came to this place I worked in and around the planning and environmental law jurisdictions of New South Wales. I worked in the private sector and also in the public sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion speaks of a government with an ambitious housing agenda. But ambition in and of itself is not enough. As said by Macbeth, vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other; in other words, it is all very well for the Albanese Labor government to have ambition towards its housing policy, but, after 16 months, its housing policy has not delivered a single house. Its policy has fallen on its face. Today we've heard it has now signed up to some cosy deal to appease the Greens to get support for its troubled Housing Australia Future Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are some of the other components of this so-called ambitious housing policy? Let's look at the $2 billion accelerator fund. This was a panicked announcement payable to the states and territories on 17 June. On the face of it, it sounds very good: 'Let's incentivise state and local governments.' I agree with that. However, this fund has provided no detail as to where these houses will be located, when they will be built or who will build them. It'll do nothing for renters in the private market and nothing for Australians trying to purchase their first home. Treasury officials have confirmed that these payments, $2 billion worth, to the states and territories were not linked to any requirement to reform planning or zoning, development regulations or productivity. In other words, this is simply a blank cheque being given to the states: 'Please, you try and fix it, states, because we don't know how to as the federal Labor government.' Treasury officials confirmed that the money has been committed without even a requirement for the states and territories to nominate how many houses will be built, despite the Prime Minister saying last week there would be thousands in the coming years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the housing minister say originally there were going to be a million new homes built. I will pretty well guarantee that this will not deliver one single new house. If Labor really wanted to help Australians with their housing costs, they would look at what they could do to incentivise private homeownership. They would look at housing in the way it should be. Housing is a continuum. We get more people into private homeownership and private renters into their own homes, and then everyone can move up the housing continuum. It allows far more money to then be available for social and other affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to be a failure. The motion was probably brought with the best of intentions but it has no real deliverables.</span>

I say let the people of Australia decide on what is misinformation and what is disinformation. Give them the authority to make up their own mind. With that, Deputy Speaker Sharkie, I thank you for the opportunity. I think there's another 40 minutes in me on this subject!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  Misinformation and disinformation are real, and they can have serious consequences for the safety and wellbeing of Australians. They can be seriously harmful. They can be designed to sow division within our communities. They can be designed to undermine our trust in each other, in our public institutions, in our organisations and even in our democracy. Misinformation and disinformation can be designed to threaten public health and safety. So it is something that I am concerned about. It is something that this government is, rightly, concerned about. And this is why we plan to tackle this threat of misinformation and disinformation with responsible measures that will make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do know that there is misinformation and disinformation out there being spread by algorithms, largely through social media, and we have seen that in the context of the pandemic and others over the previous years. A recent University of Canberra study found that 66 per cent of people said they encountered misinformation on social media about COVID-19. Twenty-three per cent encountered what they called a lot of misinformation, 36 per cent encountered some misinformation and 30 per cent of people were forwarded misinformation from someone they know—false and misleading information about treatments and how to prevent exposure, information that was designed to sow discord, that was designed to mislead people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that misinformation is also a problem in the area of national security, where malicious actors are using digital disinformation to infiltrate and influence public discourse. And this has been found in our select committee on foreign interference, which tabled its report on what risks Australia faces in this area. It highlighted that regimes continue to pose an unacceptable risk through targeted online misinformation campaigns that leverage social media platforms to skew public debate, undermine trust in our democratic institutions and establish narratives that favour the interests of authoritarian states. The report went on to note that the growth in technologies, including artificial intelligence, is making it easier and easier to conduct misinformation campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social media platforms themselves have recognised that there is a threat from misinformation and disinformation. In Australia, platforms have signed up to a voluntary Australian code of practice on disinformation and misinformation. The code commits its signatories to implement safeguards that limit the spread of misinformation and disinformation on their platforms and to report annually on their commitment to this work. This is a good start, and it has been recognised as such. Industry bodies have also said that they want more from government; they do want government to regulate in this important area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, we have a choice. We can have legislation from government; we can have involvement from a democratically elected government in the space, or we can leave this space entirely to tech billionaires and foreign malicious actors. That is essentially what we're talking about here. Our government has identified that we need to do more. The spread and influence of misinformation and disinformation by people is something that we need to act on now. Australians do need to be protected from the seriously harmful content that can be spread online, and we can do this as a federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exposure draft of this bill builds on the voluntary code already in place by boosting ACMA's ability to hold digital platforms to account. ACMA will have new information gathering powers to improve transparency around what platforms are doing to combat misinformation and disinformation—content that is false, misleading or deceptive that causes or can contribute to serious harm to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ACMA would be able to register enforceable industry codes with penalties for noncompliance. ACMA would have the power to require their industry to lift the bar where systemic issues amongst platforms are identified, and the standards used could include measures like stronger tools to support users to report misinformation and disinformation, more robust complaints handling and enabling the more extensive use of fact checkers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the legislation does not give ACMA the power to remove or deal with individual pieces of information. This is about transparency and systems. We saw that the former government previously committed to empowering ACMA to take action on misinformation and disinformation, yet, now they are opposing it. They have decided, it seems, that because they are in opposition they no longer need to take these very serious threats seriously. The Liberals and Nationals now appear to be unfazed by the need to protect Australians from harmful information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry knows we need to take action. The Australian community is looking to us for action. It is incredibly important for our democracy, for our institutions and for the conversations we have as a country that we do address the threat presented by misinformation and disinformation, and that is what the government is attempting to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion moved by the member for Banks. Whilst I agree that there are significant concerns with the proposed government legislation, I want to be very clear that I do support that the government needs to address misinformation and disinformation. We only have to look at what is happening daily on social media platforms around the debate on the referendum to see how important it is to address misinformation and disinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do find it incredible that both sides of this House can't come together on this issue. When we stop and look at the events of the US 6 January uprises, they were very much fuelled by misinformation and disinformation. It should really be a testament to all of us as to how precious democracy can be but also how quickly you can erode trust in outcomes. That's why it is so important to address misinformation and disinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, the member for Banks is calling on the government to admit that its plan is deeply flawed and to bin the bill, but that is just wiping your hands of any responsibility to fix this problem. So, yet again, I have an issue with the opposition in this respect. Some of the criticisms raised are the exemption of governments, academics and others from the application of the powers concerning misinformation and the inappropriate breath of the definition of misinformation itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I agree, in general, with some of these criticisms, there are many others that we need to really consider. I have to object to the idea that the response is just to bin the bill. A productive, useful opposition comes to the table to actually work out better legislation that will keep all of our community safe from misinformation and disinformation. We need to acknowledge the problem of misinformation and disinformation and seek to grapple with the issue it purports to address, so it's just not enough to say bin it and leave it at that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The public is greatly concerned with misinformation and disinformation, especially on online platforms where we know the vast majority of news and information is consumed, especially by younger generations. According to a Roy Morgan survey, over two-thirds of Australian adults felt they had been exposed to deceptive news items. Another study found that a quarter of a sample felt they had read stories that were completely made up. More recently, the Australia Institute's exit poll of the 2022 election found that 73 per cent of Australians came across misleading political advertising during the election campaign, and this last finding is particularly disturbing as it strikes at the very heart of our democratic system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social media companies and the power they have when it comes to the dissemination of news and information on digital platforms—the current major players of the digital platform area are keenly alive to the public's dissatisfaction with the ineffective regulation of online content. They are openly involved in developing codes for self-regulation, notably the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation 2021, commonly known as the DIGI code. Ironically it was the coalition government who were the keen supporters and developers of that code and often hid behind this voluntary code when asked to do more to regulate this sector. But the issue is clearly of major concern to the digital platform providers. The success of this code is yet to be evaluated, as it was only introduced 2021, but the issue is obviously not going to go away, and the public is open to attempts to curb the more sinister and pernicious effects of rampant disinformation and misinformation online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two major concerns with the current approach, which I address to both major parties. Ultimately, neither side has been in a hurry to address misleading and deceptive political advertising, in particular in relation to the referendum. I've proposed solutions in a private member's bill. This reform is long overdue and is supported by voters of both persuasions. We know that it's a concrete and manageable target that can be achieved by existing and well-tried concepts that are familiar to the courts in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct, without introducing difficult and challengeable concepts, such as 'misinformation' and 'disinformation'. So we do need to look at these issues, but I am concerned by the proposal of the government that wide-ranging powers of this kind over digital platform providers should be entrusted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority. ACMA's performance in regulating existing broadcast media is questionable, and I call on the government to publish a full and independent assessment of ACMA's current performance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion. This proposed legislation seeks to allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority to require records from digital platforms, to register industry generated codes for the monitoring and removal of misinformation and disinformation, and to impose a code where that does not happen or where the industry code is inadequate. There are safeguards built in, with certain content excluded by definition from the operation of the provisions, such as entertainment, parody and satire, professional news, government sources and education. Further, there is an express protection in clause 60 which refers to the implied freedom of political communication. Private messages are exempt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exclusions and protections show that the targets of the legislation are malevolent actors, both domestic and international, who seek intentionally to do harm as well as those who unintentionally would enable harm to be done through publicly available online platforms. The definition covers content which is 'false, misleading or deceptive', which is likely to cause or contribute to 'serious harm' and which is provided on a digital service and spread at scale. This doing of harm through misinformation and disinformation is already an issue in the online world. It is set to become a much bigger issue as the use of powerful AI will mean exponential growth. That is why the communications regulator needs to have the tools to take action, and that is why legislation is required. The coalition knows this and that's why, on their website, even today, under the headline 'Protecting Australians online' we find the following statement:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is there the apparent confusion amongst the coalition? Why do they say one thing on their website and another thing in this motion? We have to doubt the coalition's preparedness to actually protect people online, when they spend nine years not arming the regulator, then go to an election promising to arm the regulator and then pretend to totally oppose the legislation to arm the regulator, once it is out for consultation. The other explanation might be some sort of schism in the Liberal Party. The member for Banks is the shadow minister for communications. He now calls for the draft bill to be binned. It begs the question: Is the shadow minister suggesting that the Australian government do nothing to combat misinformation and disinformation? Is he suggesting that we should leave the Australian regulator powerless in the face of this modern-day threat? Is he suggesting the Australian government should do nothing to combat foreign interference by disinformation? Is the opposition suggesting that we should just leave digital platforms to make up their own rules, without any oversight?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… the significant role that providers play in promoting and disseminating content, and community expectations around the responsibilities that come with providing a service that comes with the potential for significant harm.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This amount of recorded support in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and in Liberal Party documentation for this very sort of legislation leaves a question mark over the sudden, vehement opposition by the member for Banks.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen a number of useful submissions, and, when constituents approach my office with concerns, I have been urging them to also make submissions. I note that the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association wants to ensure that the bill doesn't inadvertently gather up legitimate online gaming interests, and that the Human Rights Law Centre thinks it doesn't go far enough. The Victorian Bar association position is so similar to that of the member for Banks that I wonder which came first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, it is a matter of finding a good balance and ensuring that free political discourse is not impinged upon. This isn't really a matter of the coalition being against this draft bill, which they committed to bringing into effect themselves, prior to the election. It's just another example of a coalition so policy paralysed that, instead of being a constructive part of the parliamentary process, they feel the need to scramble around seeing which fringe groups they can incite into action to build a Liberal Party mailing list.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  There's one thing I'll say about the member for Banks: David Coleman is very careful and considered, and he has put forward a very astute private member's motion here. Noting that the government is seeking to impose new misinformation laws, he quite accurately describes them as 'deeply flawed', because they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before submissions closed on 20 August, the government's exposure draft bill had been subjected to widespread criticism. Some of those who came out vehemently against it were leading lawyers. They have looked at the government's bill and absolutely taken it apart, piece by piece. The minister, as much as I like the member for Greenway, has had few defenders of her plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received a number of pieces of correspondence about this. Many of them have come from Parkes, in the northern part of my electorate. Liz Naveau says: 'Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false.' I actually said that in a press conference in Queensland once and got absolutely hammered about it, but I was right then and Liz is right here. She says: 'We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this vital process.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the same household, Neil Naveau says, 'I'm an Australian, born and bred.' He loves his country and that he's free. He says, 'The bill is another attempt to silence truth and turn this country into a controlled one.' He describes the misinformation bill as 'wrong-headed and dangerous'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darren Stevenson, also from Parkes, says: 'Mis- and disinformation shows division within the community, undermines trust and can threaten public health and safety. The Albanese government is committed to keeping Australians safe online'—that is important. I know the work that the member for Forrest has done in this regard, but I digress. He says, 'That includes ensuring that the Australian Communications and Media Authority has the powers it needs to hold digital platforms to account for mis- and disinformation on their services.' He says that what this bill is proposing to do is dangerous. He says, 'There is no trust in the Albanese government with the ridiculous and hurtful policies that the Prime Minister and his government are implementing and dictating onto the Australian public.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is widespread concern right across the nation about this bill. That is why the member for Banks has brought it forward. It does stifle academic debate. How can any one authority claim it can determine and regulate the supposed objective truth of science or morality? Meta, Twitter or X is concerned the bill goes too far, stifling free speech. If ever you want to see an example of free speech, go on Twitter—go on live feed to the sorts of things that people say on Twitter or on X. I don't usually block them unless they actually make comments about military ceremonies or people I have eulogised because they have passed away. Anything else I generally let go because I do believe in free speech. True liberty is when free-born men, having the right to advise the public, may speak free. Milton said that many, many, many years ago. It was as true then as it is true now. The best way to defeat bad ideas or bad speech is with free and fair debate, allowing better ideas to come forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overbearing regulation of speech encourages scepticism—it just simply does—and distrust of authority. If there's one thing that we need from this place now, it is for people to believe in this institution and believe in the people who are elected to this institution, both in the House of Representatives and through the states in the Senate, to have that discourse of information. There are many people in this place who I don't agree with, but we don't silence them. We allow free debate to flow. The truth should not fear debate. Concerns that any opposition to policy will simply be labelled misinformation is something very right and very true in this debate. I commend what the member for Banks has done in this regard.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  Misinformation, disinformation—the facts may be false, but the consequences are real. We live in a world now where it is getting harder and harder to discern fact from fiction, and it's having a profound impact on our lives. The COVID-19 pandemic was a challenge on two fronts. It was a once-in-a-generation challenge to our healthcare systems across the world, and some remarkable achievements were made here. With our brightest scientific minds working on it, we were able to create a vaccine for COVID-19 in record time, rolling it out at an unprecedented scale and pace. But the other challenge was societal. We relied on people trusting their governments because very extensive public health measures were required to control the spread of the virus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures and the vaccine rollout were severely impacted by the dramatic increase in misinformation and disinformation online. In the words of the Director-General of the World Health Organization:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the problem of misinformation in culturally diverse communities was even more acute for a number of reasons. A study by Monash University found that effective health communication is more complicated than simply translating English messages into other languages. For example, some migrant communities may be mistrustful of authorities because they cannot trust governments in their homelands. This means they may be more susceptible to messages of disinformation around the Australian government's motivations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where culturally diverse communities get their information from is also a reason for vulnerability. A study commissioned by the NSW Council of Social Service found that only one in 10 respondents from culturally diverse backgrounds relied on government health websites as a primary source of information during the pandemic. And what was their most cited source? Facebook. These factors lead to greater susceptibility to COVID misinformation and, ultimately, to higher rates of vaccine hesitancy in many of these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Misinformation can pose a serious risk to public health. It can also have a corrosive effect on our democracy. The Australian Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media tabled its bipartisan final report on the risk posed to Australia's democracy by foreign interference through social media. It states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign interference is now Australia's principal national security threat which risks significantly undermining our values, freedoms and way of life … authoritarian regimes continue to pose an unacceptable risk to democratic societies through targeted online disinformation campaigns that leverage social media platforms to skew public debate, undermine trust in our democratic institutions, and establish narratives that favour the interests of authoritarian states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a threat in the abstract. The corrosive impact of disinformation on democracies is very present and very real. An example is the May 2023 Meta transparency report, which provides a case study of actions to combat misinformation in the context of the Australian federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the profound impact misinformation and disinformation can have, it is disappointing to see the opposition retreat into sound bites. Rather than engaging constructively with the government on an issue they cite as a top priority, they are instead playing politics. Rather than engaging in good faith with the government on an issue that a bipartisan Senate select committee says is one of Australia's most pressing security challenges, they've brought a motion full of factual inaccuracies and hyperbole. Rather than working constructively to build on industry regulation, they told the government to bin the bill when the exposure draft of the bill was out for submissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a serious opposition party, because a serious opposition party wouldn't seek to undermine the Australian government by taking away one of the tools to take on foreign interference and combat harmful misinformation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  Fake news is, of course, not new. People have been manipulated by false information throughout history. But the digital world has promoted a post-truth era where facts are now a matter of opinion. As a community, we urgently need to decide whether we want to have a measure of control over the information that we consume while protecting freedom of expression and avoiding government overreach. The government's proposed laws on misinformation and disinformation are therefore well timed. Their form, however, must be carefully calibrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to distinguish between misinformation and disinformation. The former refers to false or inaccurate information—getting the facts wrong—the latter to false information which is deliberately intended to mislead. In the case of the digital world, both spread fast, often in an uncontrolled way, and cause harm. In some cases, this can be outright dangerous, as was the case during COVID, when false treatments were promoted online. During Hurricane Ian in the US in 2022, Russian news outlet Sputnik, in what was interpreted as an attempt to undermine public trust in the authorities, promoted a narrative that the US government had abandoned storm victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent several years reporting on Donald Trump's presidency in the United States. My observation is that Trump's deliberate seeding of disinformation throughout 2020 that the election was going to be rigged triggered the eventual storming of the US Capitol by patriots in January 2021. This untold damage to US democracy continues to linger, with millions of Americans continuing to believe the election was stolen, and this may yet deliver Trump a return to the White House in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social cohesion, public health and safety, and political stability are all at risk from the rapid and uncontrolled spread of mis- and disinformation. Right now, according to a survey by Reset.Tech Australia, social media platforms are not living up to their own guidelines on fake news or to the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation, with claims that the Voice referendum would be invalid or illegal still available for all to see. As La Trobe University states in its 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">Fighting Fake News</span> report, traditional media can also contribute to the problem through the amplification of fake news. But, as Associate Professor Andrea Carson asks: what's the best way to manage it? How can it be done without government overreach, which risks the freedom and diversity of expression necessary in healthy democracies?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With penalties elevated over voluntary participation, the government's bill would bring us closer to the EU-style model of mandatory co-regulation. This approach sits at the halfway mark of approaches to this problem—on the lower end, non-regulatory approaches like digital literacy and fact checking; on the upper end, sometimes draconian anti-fake-news laws that can be misused by governments. Russia, for example, legislated to suppress media and political dissent about its war in Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Co-regulation, like that proposed in this bill, is not the same thing. Indeed, the core thesis of this proposal was coalition policy, and previously had bipartisan support. Ironically, since then the bill itself has arguably been the subject of disinformation, in the form of a knee-jerk reaction about freedom of expression. What those expressing concern need to answer is this: do they believe mis- and disinformation are a threat to democracy; and, if not this approach, what? This is absolutely a reasoned debate that is worth having.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former journalist, I believe wholeheartedly that freedom of expression is central to a healthy democracy. At the centre of the bill under discussion today is the fact that it is not the government, but the platforms, that would remain responsible for their content. New powers would allow ACMA access to a platform's procedures to see how it deals with online mis- and disinformation that can cause serious harm, and to request changes to processes, not content. ACMA would not be given arbitrary powers to determine what content is true or false nor to have posts removed. Australia has had a voluntary code along these lines since 2021, but not everyone opts in. Platform participation with registered codes would be compulsory and attract warnings, fines and penalties for noncompliance, but the definitions of mis- and disinformation in this bill may be too broad, and excluding government information and online news media content is also questionable. This is an uncomfortable but necessary conversation, and any legislation must be carefully calibrated to help rebuild, not further erode, public trust. I say: don't bin the bill; fix the bill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I understand it, the Liberal Party website to this day says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a re-elected Liberal Coalition Government will introduce stronger laws to combat harmful disinformation and misinformation online by giving the media regulator stronger information-gathering and enforcement powers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That valid intention was informed by the 2019 ACCC inquiry into digital platforms, and yet here we are tonight: the coalition come along, as they do on most days, and carry on as if an exposure draft of a bill that seeks to advance exactly the kinds of protection that the coalition itself had pledged to deliver is some kind of outrage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think there would be some acknowledgement in the motion that this is one of the dozens of areas in which the coalition, after a decade in government, did nothing, but there isn't. It's disappointing that there isn't more calm and semireasonable preparedness by the coalition to be constructive about the task at hand. Instead, we get sloganeering and negativity—'bin the bill'—in relation to a bill that hasn't actually been introduced to the parliament. And the notice of motion, as the previous speaker noted, doesn't contain anything that might suggest the coalition has given thought to solving the problem, which they identified but did nothing about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no question Australia needs up-to-date and fit-for-purpose protection when it comes to the potential for serious and harmful misinformation, particularly through digital platforms that are operated by massive, foreign owned tech companies. But let me be clear about my fundamental view on this: any regulation of speech and public conversation needs to be done with great care. Any regulation of speech and public conversation needs to keep freedom of speech and freedom of association as its touchstone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason you have an exposure draft process is so that input can be provided and improvements can be considered. That's what's occurred in the life of this parliament to date in lots of areas, but often without much participation from the coalition—in fact, in some cases it occurred despite them. The government has worked hard to begin advancing all those things that didn't occur over the previous 10 years: action on climate change, integrity improvements, repairing the social safety net, putting downward pressure on energy prices, getting wages moving again, and investing in social and affordable housing. But none of those carefully measured solutions have involved the input of the coalition, who just want to say no to everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with our central and abiding commitment to free speech, we know there are certain kinds of communication that need to be regulated. There's plenty of conversation and information that might be controversial or represent different political views or even present strange, unpopular, obnoxious or hard to like ideas. All of that is still deserving of protection as part of a healthy and diverse public square discussion. But we know that some information is disseminated with the intention of doing harm, advocating hate or violence, facilitating the abuse of children, interfering in elections or doing harm in critical areas like public health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must have the means in Australia of protecting our democratic system and our shared wellbeing from intentionally dangerous and harmful disinformation and misinformation. That's why the government has picked up the work that the previous government didn't do, by producing an exposure draft of a bill that seeks to build on the industry's existing voluntary code. What does it seek to achieve? Hey presto, surprise, surprise! Greater transparency from the big tech platform operators, greater compliance with the commitments that are already in the industry code and systemic improvements when it comes to managing and responding to complaints.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't give ACMA the power to remove content. It strengthens the expectations on the industry itself and the clarity and accountability around those expectations. It strengthens the regulator's ability to act and enforce standards. That is at the core of what's needed in this space: sensible standards and mechanisms to be able to respond to the harmful and dangerous misuse of the enormous influence that exists through digital platforms, while, of course, protecting free speech and robust debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the coalition wants to engage in a sensible and constructive fashion about how to refine and settle an effective framework, that would be very welcome. But all that this notice of motion has shown in the debate tonight is that we're going to keep getting relentless, relatively pointless negativity from a group of people that promised all sorts of things for 10 years and did absolutely nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  We have lots of motions come into this place, and some are more important than others. This is about as important as it gets because it refers to a fundamental right, which is freedom of speech. Without freedom of speech, we don't have any of the other rights. That is the right from which the others flow. If it is compromised, all of the others are, including democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see, in a lot of these motions and the response to them, a political syllogism where we identify a problem that we can all agree on and we say: 'Well, someone must do something.' Then a bill is presented: 'Well, this is something, therefore we must do that. And if you don't support that, then you're not with us on agreeing to do something about it.' The problem is that when a bad bill is presented, you either amend it or you throw it out. And this one is so bad it must be binned. There's no reworking this one, as many other members have said. It is fundamentally, in its structures and its definitions, flawed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the member for Warringah refer to the practice in the courts for 'misleading and deceptive conduct.' I've conducted trials with that section. It's section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law. It is one of the most litigated sections in Australian law. I've been in trials that have gone for over 100 hearing days. They've been before the courts for years, with multiple millions of dollars spent interpreting those words, 'misleading and deceptive.' They sound simple but in practice they're not. With a bill like this, the hard reality of trying to solve a problem that sounds simple is that we must recognise that the solution can be worse than the problem that you think you're trying to fix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the various groups that have put submissions into this draft exposure bill, none of them have been published. We had an excellent submission by the Victorian Bar. The Victorian Bar didn't do a submission on the draft Voice position, but the government was quite happy to claim that a vote by its members was great. They've put pen to paper on this particular bill. You can't pick and choose when you're going to listen to an organisation. It's the same with the Law Council. They've given a very concerning submission, where they've said that the prospect that digital platform providers and ACMA will be required to sift information from opinion or claims is, in itself, likely to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Again, you can't pick and choose when you listen to groups like the Law Council, because this bill is deeply flawed. Even the media union, the MEAA, have criticised it, and they have thousands of members who work in this sector. Will Labor listen to one of its own unions which actually works in this area? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will, in its current draft, create a lawyer's picnic. One of the questions that anyone will ask is: what is excluded content? There are enormous carve-outs within this provision. We've heard many members, including the member for Goldstein, talk about the rise of Donald Trump, saying that they saw it firsthand and that we could have our own 6 January moment. Guess what: in this bill, if President Trump held office here, he'd be excluded. He's not covered. He gets a free pass, but no-one mentions that. That's the problem with this: it creates a status of opinion. So an Australian President Trump is fine, but a man, woman, boy or girl on the street is not fine. That's totally unacceptable, but that's the way this has been put. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the way it links even the slightest bit of misinformation. It says that it's 'reasonably likely to cause or contribute to harm'. So, if there's a paper or post that's been written and there's one sentence or one line could cause or contribute to harm, that would mean that it could be censored. Again, we've heard from the government that ACMA, won't be doing that; they'll just be creating a regime for the tech companies to do it. They are in the business of making money and they're going to be extra cautious. They don't have the time or the staff to sift through these, so you're going to purchase off-the-shelf an AI program that will sift through as much information as possible so it doesn't bring you before the wrath of ACMA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in all of the other carve-outs, what does 'news content' mean? What does 'academia' mean? And why should politicians, journalists and professors get a free pass? We should all be subject to the same free-speech laws. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  At the heart of this motion, really, is a conversation about our democracy and, of course, the need to balance the freedom of expression with preserving and protecting our precious democracy. It is really important to note that democracy is precious in our world, and we've seen too many jurisdictions where people have taken for granted the fact that there is a stable democracy. Unfortunately, we've seen too many examples of places where misinformation and disinformation have undermined the institutions that we really should be protecting in our parliaments and our governments. We should also be protecting the right for people to freely exercise their expression and their right to make decisions about really important things like who will govern them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know misinformation and disinformation threaten the safety and wellbeing of Australians. We see, with online platforms, that this misinformation and disinformation are spread at speed and scale, and the impact of these harmful campaigns are felt offline too. Left unchecked, our democracy, society and economy are at risk—and I don't think that's overstating things at all. We know that, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, most Australians are concerned about, and have experienced, online misinformation. I have certainly encountered this, as I am sure other people in this place have too. We know that disinformation campaigns have the potential to undermine our national security and the integrity of our democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2023, a bipartisan final report of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media was tabled. On the risk posed to Australia's democracy by foreign interference through social media, it said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… targeted online disinformation campaigns that leverage social media platforms to skew public debate, undermine trust in our democratic institutions, and establish narratives that favour the interests of authoritarian states.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that social media and digital platforms—often private, overseas based companies—already do take down misinformation and disinformation content at scale every day. Some, but not all, platforms have signed up to a voluntary, self-regulatory code of practice that was developed by industry to respond to the threat of misinformation and disinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This exposure draft, which has been referred to through the debate tonight, builds upon this work. It builds upon industry's self-regulatory code of practice, as well as key recommendations made by the ACCC, in its 2019 Digital Platforms Inquiry, and ACMA, in its June 2021 report to government on the adequacy of platforms' disinformation and news quality measures. This bill empowers the Australian regulator to apply greater transparency from big tech, to encourage compliance with industry codes and to require systemic improvements by industry when necessary, such as in relation to complaints handling processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not empower ACMA to take down individual pieces of content. Digital platforms will continue to be responsible for the content on their platforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it truly remarkable, and of course ironic, that in a debate on misinformation and disinformation we've heard so much of both of those things from those opposite this evening. What our government is trying to do here is balance freedom of expression with the need to protect democracy, and I would have thought that's something that everyone in this place could agree is a good thing to do. Unfortunately, however, those opposite are taking this issue and cynically using it to score cheap political points by exploiting people's fears. They're all over the shop on this issue. Where we would have hoped they'd work constructively on this issue to address seriously harmful misinformation and disinformation that threatens Australians and our democracy, we see what we're seeing tonight, which is a lot of misinformation pedalled despite the fact that at the last federal election the coalition went to the election saying they would introduce a bill to empower ACMA to address misinformation and disinformation. So it's really important we call this cynical attempt out for what it is, which is just an attempt to score cheap political points at the expense of our democracy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  There's no doubt that misinformation and disinformation is a significant risk to our democracy, and those on this side of the House have never said otherwise. As I have said recently, with the uptake of AI we are losing the ability to trust what we see and what we hear, and that's significant. But, just because this risk exists, it doesn't mean we are going to support a deeply flawed piece of legislation—so flawed that it has been opposed by almost everyone, from the Human Rights Commission; the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance; the Law Council of Australia; civil liberty groups; and everyday Australians in my electorate of Casey and many electorates across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had many people contact my office concerned about the implications this bill will have on freedom of speech, democratic rights and individual thought. To those people I would say this: the Liberals will not be supporting this bill. Those of us on this side of the House believe in freedom of thought, worship, speech and association. We believe in a less government interference in our daily lives, not more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill defines misinformation as 'a statement which is unintentionally false, misleading or deceptive'. Let's have a think about that for a second. How often do Australians make statements that they believe to be true but turn out to be false? We're not experts at everything but, under this definition, Australians will be held to account for statements they make being unintentionally wrong. Under this legislation, if the regulator ACMA thinks digital companies like Facebook and Instagram aren't doing enough to remove that sort of content and if they think it's capable of what the government calls 'serious harm', those digital companies can get fines worth $6.88 billion or five times their annual turnover. So what are the digital companies going to do? They're going to remove posts from their platforms to mitigate the risks of fines, tarnishing Australians' rights to freedom of speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's plan, there will be one rule for Anthony Albanese and his government and another for everyone else. Information authorised by the government cannot be deemed misinformation. Criticisms of the government by Australians however can be deemed misinformation and therefore are at risk of being removed from public debate on digital platforms. And it doesn't end there. Nothing an academics says can be misinformation, but statements by somebody disagreeing with that academic can be misinformation. Good faith statements made by comedians and entertainers cannot be misinformation, but good faith statements made by Australians on political matters are misinformation. What we can potentially see is the Labor Party or future governments using the term 'misinformation' to try to silence those who do not share their political views, and this is a dangerous proposition in a free society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week in question time, we saw Minister Burke criticise and label an ad voicing opposition to Labor's industrial relations bill as 'misinformation'. Under this legislation Minister Burke could ban that ad. Anne Twomey, a constitutional expert, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today, said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I mean there is a serious risk that in combating misinformation and disinformation we seriously undermine freedom of speech, which is a pillar of that system of democracy that we're trying to defend. … we might actually make the situation even worse than the problem that we're trying to cure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Human Rights Commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, has published a powerful submission to the government on this legislation, saying the bill risks 'enabling unpopular or controversial opinions or beliefs to be subjectively labelled as misinformation or disinformation and censored'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we acknowledge the risk of misinformation and disinformation, but a deeply flawed bill has implications for free speech for our democratic society, and that is why this motion is so important. We've seen time and time again the risk in other countries. We can't allow that risk in our country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I'm actually very troubled that the shadow minister for communications is willing to move a motion attacking a minister and her department who are trying to take strong action against one of the most serious national security threats that we have in this country. We've just recently marked the anniversary of the Optus hacking scandal, which was a difficult time for many people, but through the guidance of our government and relevant stakeholders, we're taking tough and appropriate action to protect our national security and our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just come through the most gruelling pandemic in our national history where we saw the threat of disinformation and misinformation to public safety, including ridiculous suggestions that drinking or injecting bleach can safely treat a viral infection. This really worried me during the last parliament, and I did call out the previous member for Dawson and the previous member for Hughes, who were desperate for media attention, and as such, instituted a program of disinformation that reached the widest area of our country. False and misleading information about the pandemic, such as how to prevent exposure, possible treatments and the origins of the virus have been shown to have real-world consequences, including personal illness, damage and death. I certainly saw that in my electorate, where people were so frightened by the disinformation that they denied themselves appropriate treatment and died.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I called out the previous government for this. They were essentially silent on the issue. It's an absolute tragedy that we are still seeing members of this parliament distributing so much disinformation, including one senator in this place who has distributed a number of CDs and lectures on public health that are clearly false, that are clearly misleading and that are doing irreparable harm to our public health policies. This is still happening in this parliament, and it needs to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only two years ago, here, in this parliament, the member for Hughes used his position and his media platforms to dispense nothing but lies and false hope, all for his own gain and our pain. Too many members and senators of this parliament have abused their privileged roles to spread lies about COVID vaccines, lockdowns and management. A United Australia senator from Victoria has used the parliament's mail system and the MPs' communication budget to send ridiculous, deliberately misinformed thumb drives and CDs about COVID vaccines throughout the parliament and to a wider audience in the community. The mis- and disinformation within these very walls, at the highest levels of Australian politics, has been a tragedy, and when the shadow minister comes out and attacks the Minister for Communications through this motion, I must ask him: Where does the opposition sit when it comes to mis- and disinformation? Are they happy for this to be distributed? Do they really want this to continue?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous minister for communications, the current member for Bradfield, was going to act on this very issue, and in very similar fashion, yet now the coalition—or the 'no-alition'—sees this proposed bill as a major issue. Since when? They're reinventing themselves. This was highlighted by Paul Karp of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> in July this year, when he noted that the coalition went to the May 2022 election with a promise to introduce new laws to hold big tech companies to account. They never did, of course. Since when has national security and the need to tackle disinformation been a partisan issue? I am a parent and I'm a grandparent, and I am worried what my children and grandchildren are being exposed to online. They live online. It's different. It's a generational change that we need to deal with, and anyone who thinks that we don't is crazy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This draft bill does not empower ACMA to take down individual pieces of content. Digital platforms will continue to be responsible for the content on their platforms. The shadow minister's motion demonstrates that he misunderstands the bill, because a number of the points he raises are completely incorrect. We need to do this. We need to do this for future generations. It is very important, and this parliament needs to act now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  In Australia we live in a free and equal society, or at least that's what governments over the past 100 years have striven to achieve for all their citizens. Freedom to form our own opinions, freedom to seek information and freedom to ask questions are all tenets of a democratic society, yet this bill seeks directly to negate that. As members of the National Party, we maintain a strong sense of central values. These include the preservation of the rights of the individual and equality of opportunity for all; the preservation of freedom of the press, radio, television and means of communication; the preservation of freedom of speech; and the strong belief that governments should provide a framework for individual growth, not control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill flies directly in the face of these values. These aren't just National Party values; these are the values of everyday, ordinary Australians. Not only does it threaten freedom of speech; it assigns government as the ultimate approver of all information that is classified a fact. This mirrors the ideals of some communist countries or those under dictatorship. It is not what we, as a federal government or as a country, aspire to. Of grave concern is the fact that the definition of 'misinformation' is so broad that it could capture almost any statement made by Australians in the context of political debate, and the government of the day, as the ultimate deciders of what is classified as 'misinformation', can effectively censor those who disagree with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is literally giving licence to any government—and I warn the other side: any government—who disagrees with them. The bill is literally giving power for information. It is a terrifying thought. And that's not just my opinion or that of my colleagues. This is the opinion of the Human Rights Commissioner, civil liberties groups, the Law Council of Australia and the media union—the very bodies that advise the federal government when it is forming policy. How can we now ignore these important institutions? On one hand, this government is obsessed with forming a lobby advisory body and labelling it 'the Voice', while on the other hand it completely ignores existing advisory bodies and seeks to silence the voices of all Australian citizens. The Human Rights Commission's submission states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  The World Economic Forum has ranked the spread of misinformation as among the world's top risks. There are numerous reasons we need to act on misinformation and disinformation. Both have real-world dangers. These include consequences for public health and safety, for social cohesion and for electoral integrity—and, therefore, for democracy itself. False, misleading and deceptive content has always been with us. The difference now is that where a myth used to be spread amongst just a few people, social media has magnified this risk and can spread it a thousandfold or more. As Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the internet said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While the web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred, and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw during the COVID pandemic the deadly consequences of misinformation and disinformation, as people turned to treatments such as drinking or injecting bleach or drinking alcohol based cleaning products. In the US, misinformation had severe public health consequences, often undermining efforts to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, for example. Misinformation about vaccines continues to pose significant health risks. When he was head of the NHS in the UK, Simon Stevens said misinformation from antivaxxers on social media had fuelled a tripling of measles cases in the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of misinformation and disinformation in the electoral sphere is incalculable. A Brookings Institute paper found that misinformation is eroding the public's confidence in democracy. Meanwhile, the Australian Human Rights Commission has noted that misinformation is one of the three particular risks to democracy and human rights in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Claims that the proposed changes amounts to censorship misunderstand the operation of the bill, and the fact that digital platforms are responsible for the content on their platforms. Social media and digital platforms—private, overseas based companies—already take down misinformation and disinformation content, at scale, every day. Some platforms have signed up to a voluntary self-regulatory code of practice that was developed by industry to respond to the threat of misinformation and disinformation. But voluntary codes have shortfalls. Not all platforms participate, and some cherry-pick the areas of the code that they will respond to. That's why a mandatory, co-regulatory approach is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of misinformation covers content which is false, misleading or deceptive, which is likely to cause, or contribute to, serious harm, and which is provided on a digital service and spread at scale. It includes content disseminated with intent to deceive, including purposefully or maliciously disseminated information. The definition sets a high bar because of its serious harm threshold. The government is not ruling what information is false. The Australian Communications and Media Authority would not have powers to determine what content is true or false or direct that specific posts be removed. Digital platforms will continue to be responsible for the content on their services. The content of private messages, authorised electoral communications, parody and satire, and news media remains outside the scope of the proposed changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is about transparency, and, importantly, it is about systems and processes. ACMA would be able to check how a platform deals with online misinformation and disinformation that can cause serious harm and would be able to request changes to processes. The bill empowers the regulator to require greater transparency from big tech, to encourage compliance with industry codes and to require systemic improvements by industry where necessary, such as in relation to complaints-handling processes. As the former chair of the ACCC Rod Sims said, governments face two choices on these vital but difficult issues: do nothing and leave it to the platforms to decide whether to do anything at all or seek to intervene in some way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the shadow minister has nothing more than a three-word slogan—'In the bin'—the Albanese government will not resile from holding big tech to account and keeping Australia safe online.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on this important motion this evening on a day marked with sadness and reflection for the people of Chile and for the defenders of democracy everywhere. On 11 September 1973, elements of the Chilean Armed Forces launched an illegal attack on the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. In the aftermath of the coup, Chile fell under military rule, with a brutal junta led by Augusto Pinochet unleashing untold suffering in that country. The Chilean coup marked the beginning of a period of pain, suffering, violence and oppression for the people of Chile. The Pinochet regime assumed an almost totalitarian attitude, with any opponents—real or perceived—facing absolute brutality. Extrajudicial killings and torture were common tools of control. At the same time, the regime ruled through violence. It embarked upon an aggressive assault on the economy of Chile , pursuing radical neoliberal changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most insidious element of the coup is the foreign involvement which brought it about. Within the ideological rhetoric of the Cold War, the Nixon administration in the United States opposed the election of the Allende government and his ascension to the presidency of Chile and sought to undermine his government even before he was inaugurated. Planning was deep in detail and even included the murder of General Rene Schneider, Pinochet's predecessor as Chilean army chief and an opponent of the coup. Unfortunately, elements of a previous Australian government were also involved in the intervention that led to the coup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's right that we remember this terrible coup in this place. Chile is part of Australia's story. Australia and Chile have long been connected—two great nations facing each other across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The great port city of Valparaiso was an important stop for many vessels making the voyage both to and from Australia. Exchanges between the peoples of Chile and Australia are also very well established. In 1837 General Jose Joaquin Prieto was exiled to Sydney, arriving on the schooner <span style="font-style:italic;">Colo Colo</span>. In 1834, 10 convicts absconded from Tasmania in the brig <span style="font-style:italic;">Frederick</span> and escaped all the way to Chile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the 1830s many Chileans migrated to Australia to work in agriculture and mining. One of the most pertinent connections between Australia and Chile can be found in the story of our third Prime Minister, John Christian Watson, who was born in Valparaiso. His father worked on the ships that crossed the Pacific. Watson eventually ended up in Sydney, became a founding member of the Australian Labor Party and in 1904 became Prime Minister of Australia, leading the first social democratic government anywhere in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In more recent times Chilean Australians have made outstanding contributions to life in Australia, particularly those who came here after the coup. The Whitlam government worked to bring many Chileans to safety here in Australia. Of those who came, I'm reminded in particular of Victor Marillanca. Victor is a constituent of mine and a life member of the ACT branch of the Australian Labor Party. In 1973 he opposed the coup and stood up for democracy. He was persecuted and tortured, the injuries from which continue to plague him. After coming to Australia, Victor established a Latin American program on community radio, and 47 years later it is still going strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we remember a dark chapter of history but resolve to move forward and never repeat the failures and mistakes of the past. History remains open to teach us lessons and we must ensure that we properly learn them. We can never allow the terrible events of 11 September 1973 to happen again. In the words of the Chilean President, I recognise that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The only way to build a future that is more free and respectful of life and human dignity is to know the whole truth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  Today marks the 50th anniversary of the bloody US-backed military coup that overthrew the democratically elected Chilean government on 11 September1973. After President Salvador Allende was elected in 1970, the CIA worked to destabilise his government and to create the conditions for a military coup. The death toll of the coup and subsequent military dictatorship under the rule of General Augusto Pinochet is still not known. The best estimate we have is that around 40,000 Chileans were tortured or killed under the regime's ruthless purge of political opponents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion has some critical omissions. First and foremost, it names the mysterious interference of foreign powers, but doesn't name which nations. The role of the US is widely known, but many may not realise that Australia also played a role in destabilising the Allende government, paving the way for the military coup. Thanks to documents declassified in 2021, we know that the Australian Security and Intelligence Service, ASIS, operated a base in Santiago from 1971 to 1973 and supported the CIA in their operations there. Only around 18 months later, the then newly elected Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, ordered the base to be shut down. Unfortunately, we know little else about what ASIS was actually up to during that time. Further attempts to declassify records in 2021 were blocked by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, supposedly in the national interest—more secretive even than the US and UK on this event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This information is now five decades old. The Australian public deserves to know what ASIS was doing there aiding and abetting a military coup that resulted in the torture and death of tens of thousands of people. The Australian public deserves to know because this government continues a long-term collusion and relationship with the United States, despite the United States's poor record of interference in foreign affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chilean coup is not the only time the US has actively undermined democratically elected governments. In 1953 the fledgling Iranian democracy was overthrown by a CIA backed coup, after efforts to nationalise the Iranian oil industry out of the hands of the British, who had controlled it for decades. Iran has never since had a democratic government. In 1954, just a year later, the US explicitly authorised a coup against the democratically elected government of Guatemala at the behest of the American owned corporation the United Fruit Company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could continue, but I'd be here all night. We need only to think back to recent history—the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya—to know that, while the Cold War may be over, the US appetite for meddling in other nation's affairs and destroying their inhabitants' lives in the process has not subsided. And Australia has often been right behind them, never questioning. The result of all this meddling has not been the championing of democracy; it has been the destabilisation of regions felt across the globe today. In fact, this motion moved by the member for Bean mentions neither the US's involvement nor Australia's involvement in the coup, and that fact is worrying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a foreign policy independent of the US, and here's why. Fifty years ago today, in 1973, Australia joined with the CIA to help topple a democratically elected government. Australia has followed the US into countless wars that have resulted in the deaths of millions and the destabilisation of entire regions. This same Labor Party that refuses to acknowledge this is the Labor Party that has happily signed us onto the AUKUS agreement with the US, spending hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars on nuclear attack submarines, ostensibly to prop up US hegemony in the Pacific, submarines that, even before they've been built, have inflamed tensions in the region and made us less safe. Whispers of dissent at the recent ALP National Conference were summarily crushed, and even former Prime Minister and Labor royalty Paul Keating's calls against AUKUS have been ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The major parties seem absolutely incapable of questioning the orthodoxy of US hegemony. Do they really still want us to be effectively America's lapdog 50 years after the bloody Chilean coup?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  On the 50th anniversary of the coup d'etat in Chile, we remember the many who suffered during the brutal 17-year dictatorship. The Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which Assistant Minister Tim Watts visited during his visit to Santiago recently, shines a light on the human rights violations inflicted and recognises the important progress made since Chile's return to democracy. We celebrate the important contribution made by the Whitlam government in publicly deploring the coup and rejecting the complicity of foreign powers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia made an important statement in welcoming a generation of Chilean immigrants to Australia, and they've made such a rich contribution to Australian society and democracy. I'll just talk for a moment about a mate of mine Roberto from Melbourne. He's an absolutely fantastic bloke. His parents immigrated from Chile in the early seventies. I don't know the year exactly, but they migrated and have made such an incredible contribution. What I can say about the Chilean people that I know through Roberto is that they are very, very friendly people; they are incredibly friendly people. I look forward to visiting Chile one day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chileans are, in fact, the second-largest group of Hispanic Australians. The 2021 census revealed almost 30,000 people in Australia were born in Chile, 70 per cent of them were Australian citizens. Our largest Chilean Australian communities are in Sydney, Melbourne, where my mate Roberto lives, and Canberra. It's a little-known fact that one of the first two Chileans to arrive to Australia in 1837 was former president Ramon Freire, who was exiled for attempting to return to power in a coup. In 1899, also little known, Chile opened a consulate office in Newcastle. Australia and Chile then established diplomatic relations in 1945, and Australia open a diplomatic legation in Santiago in 1946. Another fascinating fact, as the member for Bean pointed out, is that the first Labor Prime Minister, Chris Watson, was born in Chile as the son of a Chilean citizen of German descent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chileans first migrated to Australia in a significant wave of around 2,000 people between 1968 and 1970. The second wave occurred in 1970 following the election of Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected Marxist president in the world. Both of these waves were overwhelmingly from the middle class and became small-business owners in Australia. The third and largest wave of migrants followed the 1973 military coup and the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the wave of migrants from Chile that we honour today. This explains how the Australian story is bound up with Chile's own political history. Of the 500,000 people fleeing the coup, Australia welcomed over 21,000 with open arms. We also gave asylum to Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile, from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018, as well as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Bachelet later moved to East Germany, and thousands of Chileans also returned to Chile after those events. But we can be proud of the bonds that these experiences forged between our countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Chile is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, with an Indo-Pacific focus and emerging bilateral links in green energy and connectivity. Our engagement spans mining, resources, education and research and people-to-people links. We have a lot of Australians visiting Chile, and a lot of Chileans coming here to visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it marks the anniversary, Chile is looking to the world to reaffirm our shared commitment to democracy and human rights, calling for a commitment to safeguard democracy and the rule of law and to recommit to multilateral processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By speaking about migration and people-to-people relationships, I by no means want to escape the fact that, over time, many wrong things were done, and we look to the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I rise to also mark the 50th anniversary of the 1973 coup in the Republic of Chile; 11 September 1973 marked a day of unimaginable tragedy for Chile. It was a turning point for the country and part of a tragic continuation of foreign interference at the expense of people's freedoms and liberties. Chile's democratically elected president Salvador Allende signified Chile's freedom and sovereignty and the democratic and human rights of not only the people of Chile but to Latin America, the Global South and, indeed, the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This commemoration is evidence of how solidarity, struggle and truth in the face of injustice is what lives on, values that stand testament to what continues to inspire, because who can forget the images of the democratically elected Salvador Allende standing valiantly in the face of a violent military coup?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the important contribution made by the then Whitlam government in not only publicly deploring the coup but rejecting the complicity of foreign powers. Today, as we honour the many who have suffered during the brutal Pinochet dictatorship, so too must we recognise that the violent coup and subsequent military dictatorship was supported and enabled by the interference of foreign powers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it marks the anniversary, Chile is looking to the world to reaffirm our shared commitment to democracy and human rights, and I indeed welcome the Ambassador of the Republic of Chile, who was in the House today during question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On an IPU delegation to Chile in 2003, I had the opportunity to meet with Salvador Allende's daughter Isabel Allende, who was then president of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile, and was struck by how universal and ubiquitous the memory of those events are in Chile's national psyche.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia made an important statement in welcoming a generation of Chilean immigrants to Australia and who continue to make a rich contribution to Australian society. I have a very strong relationship with our local Chilean diaspora community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impressive diversity of the Chilean economy today reflects the energy, the resilience and the vibrancy of its people. Australians also have a deep appreciation of Pablo Neruda's work, the poet diplomat, who symbolised the beauty and the voice of the Chilean people's struggles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trade union movement in Victoria has a long and proud history of international solidarity. In continuing this solidarity, and this tradition, the Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union is running a series of cultural and political activities that recognise the sacrifices of movements around the world. In reaffirming our movement's support and solidarity, they are tonight, in Melbourne at Unity Hall in Trades Hall, commemorating 50 years of solidarity and struggle with the Chilean people. They join in solidarity and the lifelong commitment to improving the lives of working people, not only in our home state of Victoria but across the country and beyond our shores. Wherever there is a struggle to improve working conditions, wherever there is a fight against political oppression, wherever there is a place beyond Australia's shores in which injustice reigns, we must stand in solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect on the words of a long-time advocate of the international peace movement, former Victorian state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the late Frank Cherry. His words provide us with important lessons, quite often lost in today's social and political culture. Frank Cherry spoke of the development of an informed and educated workforce, a workforce that understood that international solidarity wasn't just an object of impassioned faith but of direct action. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The union should not be restricted simply to wages and conditions, but a broader picture of the community. All shop stewards and officials of the union must be prepared and educated to deal with the broad issues facing all working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our solidarity and support across Australia serves to do just that. Historical parallels require movements to remember and recommit to the values that shape history, both local and international. These linkages are not abstract, and I want to finish with Salvador Allende's final words, from his farewell speech on this very same and fateful day 50 years ago, which speak truth to this solidarity:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. Keep in mind that, much sooner than later, the great avenues will again be opened through which will pass free men to construct a better society. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 10 years, the sporting landscape, not just in Australia but the world, has completely changed. Women's sport has not only emerged but, I would argue, now dominates in some ways. Women's skill, knowledge and execution are on par with men's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we can trace this emergence to Cathy Freeman at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, who, along with Susie O'Neill in the pool and so many others, caught our imagination. Cathy Freeman's win was magnificent. She ran with the hopes of the nation on her back and won. Regardless of how we got here, the point is: women's sport has arrived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year was 2020, the venue was the MCG—I was lucky enough to get tickets to pay my first visit to arguably Australia's most famous sporting arena, the MCG—and I was joined by 86,000 other fans. The occasion was the final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The Bills, Dougs and Gregs of my childhood had been replaced by Alyssa, Beth and Meg, and, over the ensuing few hours, Australia won, defeating India by an amazing 85 runs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The record books speak for themselves. The Australian women's cricket team have been the ICC Women's T20 World Cup champions in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020 and 2023, and in 1978, 1982, 1988, 1997, 2005, 2013 and 2022, they were the Women's Cricket World Cup champions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it isn't just cricket that women excel in. In netball, the Diamonds have dominated for decades. Last month, they brought home the Netball World Cup crown for the 12th time. To top it off, they won with a record score of 61-45, the largest world cup victory in 28 years. Then, of course, we have the Matildas. It wasn't a race that stopped a nation this time; it was a tournament and a game, and we won't forget Sam Kerr's goal. If you need no other sign that the time for women's sport has arrived, then you need to look no further than the support our nation provided to the Matildas during this year's FIFA Women's World Cup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all our strides, there's still a way to go. Women's sport needs greater availability on free-to-air TV, and women's sport needs to have a greater parity with men with regard to pay. But I do commend the work that Australian cricket has made in this regard, particularly the men cricketers in supporting the women to get pay parity. I can't help but think that the generations of women who began this women's sporting movement would be proud—proud and chuffed. Their efforts, after so many years, are coming to fruition. I can't wait for my next MCG or SCG experience. Soccer, league, cricket, netball or whatever, I know that Australia's female sporting champions will do their code and country proud, and the Albanese Labor government will support them every step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent success of women's sport must be accompanied by investment to ensure that the momentum and enthusiasm continues. Those it inspires must be supported. Recently, the government announced a $200 million Play Our Way program that will be used to improve sporting facilities and provide more equipment for women and girls. This funding will go towards local, grassroots sporting clubs, who are the backbone of not just women's sport but sport for all genders and all ages. But it's more than that. Investing in our local sporting club brings our communities together and promotes healthier lifestyles, builds relationships and teaches valuable skills that can be applied throughout life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to commend Catherine Cannuli, a former Matilda herself, who's working with Southern Districts Soccer at Cirillo oval at Middleton Grange in my electorate, providing support for women's and girls' soccer. She successfully ran a tournament for primary school children last week. Unfortunately, because I was here, I wasn't able to be there, but, looking at all the photos on Facebook and talking to Catherine, I know it was a wonderful day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all those women in Werriwa who support our sporting champions all through their lives. </span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I want to commend the member for Werriwa for this very important motion. Like her, I'm a sports tragic. It's an important topic we need to talk on. I grew up playing a lot of sport, but I'm now the father of a seven-year-old daughter, which does change your perspective. It shouldn't always be that way, but that's the reality of the world. She's at home today, nursing a broken heart. She had her futsal grand final today, and, after going through the season undefeated, they lost in a penalty shootout, and there were tears on the way home. Part of me is a little bit—'happy' isn't the right word, but I know she will learn valuable life lessons out of that loss today. I was fortunate to receive those lessons growing up and were very much foundational in the person who I am today, and I spoke about that in my first speech. Sport has a unique ability to bring people together and to teach life skills in a safe environment, and I have that opportunity growing up. My daughter now has that opportunity. She doesn't know a world without elite women's sport, and I think that's a wonderful thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cheered on the Matildas like everyone, and her passion, when that final goal went through—I thought I was looking at myself watching a Collingwood grand final back in the day. She was fully invested in that result. This is what it's about. It's about creating equal opportunities, and it's a journey that we're on as a society. There is the Matildas and the success of the world cup and Sam Kerr. The Diamonds have dominated netball for generations. The Cricket World Cup, whether it is the T20 or retaining the Ashes over in England, these are becoming such important moments for our community. I remember watching the first Women's World Cup game, here in Canberra. On one TV there was the final day of the men's Ashes. The Women's World Cup was on at the same time on another TV. I'm a cricket tragic, but the reality was there were about three or four of us watching both screens, and 99 per cent of the crowd were watching the soccer and riding every kick and bump along the way, which was great to see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are challenges we have at the community level. Over 20 or 30 years of playing sport, the facilities aren't what they need to be. In my community and many communities across the country, the reality is many were built when there were predominantly men playing. Even now they are not up to scratch. For example, on Saturday morning I visited the Mooroolbark Soccer Club with the shadow minister for sport, Anne Ruston. There are two changerooms from the 1960s. They have over 25 teams—men's and women's teams—and trying to share that same facility is not conducive to keeping young girls and boys or men and women in community sport. There is, absolutely, more that we need to do in this regard. It is heartening that the government have committed $200 million. It would have been nice if they had matched the $250 million commitment that the coalition made, but we'll start with 200 million and continue to put the pressure on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also need to continue to look at as we go on this journey is how we can start at the grassroots but allow professional women to earn more. It is a journey, and the commercials of the AFL and the Premier League clearly are more significant towards the men's game. That is a historical thing, and we cannot change that overnight. But we do need to continue to provide support—as the commercials stack up—to make sure it is reliable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Completely unconnected to this motion, my daughter got a Sam Kerr book yesterday, and she was drawing and colouring in a picture of Sam Kerr in one of our rooms. She didn't know I was speaking on this today, but she said to me: 'Dad, I want to be a Matilda when I grow up. Can you make sure I get paid the same as the men?' It hits you. Our job here is not to be parents, but our job is to take note of our experience, and my daughter represents a whole generation. That's what we need to understand: she is seven years old, and whether she makes it or not there will be young seven-year-olds today who will be Matildas in 20 or 30 years time. It is our responsibility to take our lived experience, our family's experience, and extrapolate it across the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always support all sport—community sports, women's sports. It is a journey we need to make to make sure that it's sustainable and commercially viable. We need to continue to do more. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  This is an important motion from the member for Werriwa, for two reasons. Firstly, it is right to celebrate success. The across-the-board success of women's sporting teams at the national and international level is something new in the history of our country, and we should not let that pass without celebrating it, marking it and honouring the women, the players, the coaches, the support staff and of course the families in support who have made it happen. Perhaps there was some government policy that assisted along the way, too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we need to sustain this. We need to commit to maintaining and continuing to develop women's participation in sport, not just internationally but right the way down to Little Athletics. We can't allow something so good to wane. Governments will have a role in this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Actually, women's sport has always been a prominent part of our national life. If we cast our minds back, however, we find that many of the famous names in women's sport in this country competed in individual events, not team events: Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Cathy Freeman, Betty Cuthbert and Ash Barty. In swimming, of course, many of those individually brilliant athletes combined to bring us medley gold as well, but what has really changed in recent years is that there is a traceable improvement in the fortunes of women's team sport across many codes. We are now competitive internationally in cricket, netball and basketball to name a few, and at home there is growth and interest across these and AFLW and volleyball and more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the world's most popular team sport—association football, international football, soccer, or, as most everyone else in the world knows it, football—the Matildas have had such a surge in performance, success and popularity that the great Socceroos are slightly in the shade. Our most internationally famous and feted athlete of any gender is Sam Kerr—from WA, by the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke a while back about the magnificent women making Australia proud in motorsport—for example, motorcycle racing champion, Jessica Gardiner, who has competed internationally and won in her categories in enduro for some 13 years straight. The motorsports have taken great strides to assist interested girls and women to get involved from the ground up. Sometimes individual brilliance in sport can rise up, even if the support structures and the culture of support are lacking. For teams success, however, every member of the team needs to be supported. Sport is great of course, as entertainment. In our government, the ministry of sport sits quite properly under the head of health. The best thing about the wave of success at the international and national level for our women's sporting teams is that it means that the leagues are healthy all the way down to the under-7s and that the drop-off of engagement in sports by young women in their early teens is less of an issue than it used to be. This will mean a few extra torn ACLs, I know, but the balance in favour of a long, healthy and fully lived life is significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A big part of that is having role models to look up to. As proud as we are of the Matildas and others for their performances and record setting, each of those players should be immensely proud of the example that they have given, and continue to give, to the next generation—in the stands on tiptoes for 90 minutes, wearing their size 5 replica shirts and watching with wide-open eyes and oft-bated breath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we as legislators support these heroes? A couple of ideas to come to mind. Pay parity really should go without saying, but it doesn't. Government funding should always be predicated on fairness. Down the other end, where the kiddies are signing up in droves and extra teams are being put on to meet demand, let's make sure that there are sufficient facilities so that the sisters are not the poor cousins of their brothers, as they've tended to be for so long. With these changes come changes in culture. It's a virtuous circle. The Spanish football team won the World Cup here, and their battle against misogyny has been front and centre in the press ever since. This is necessary. Issues need to be issues until they are no longer issues. One day, the Australian women will win the World Cup in Spain and come home to nothing but celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to acknowledge some of the older women who were the pioneers in each of the codes and in their sports who struggled to achieve their dreams in conditions that were wholly unsupportive. Their sacrifices and battles bear fruit now not for them but for the millions of girls and women who are looking forward to their next match next week.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  Equality is more than words on paper, although often it starts as statements and words and laws. True equality fuses in the hearts, the souls and the minds. As we know, sport has the capacity to mirror the soul. It can draw out truths and shine a path in ways that other parts of life can't. Sport brings us together. The stories of sport are the stories of Australia: Cathy Freeman lighting the cauldron and running the 400 metres of her life; Ash Barty and Evonne Goolagong-Cawley holding up Wimbledon trophies; my constituent and friend Ellie Cole and her 17 amazing Paralympics medals; Michelle Payne in the Melbourne Cup; Marjorie Jackson-Nelson, the gold medallist who went on to be governor; Jane Saville and her grit; Betty Cuthbert and her strength on and off the track; and, of course, 'our Dawn', whose achievements and larrikin spirit embody so much about this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month we witnessed a new claim on our national heart with the performance of the Matildas at the FIFA World Cup. It's an event that broke TV-viewing records and captured the country. The Matildas are our team: more than equality in words but in heart, soul and enthusiasm as well—a complete embodiment of our country and its hopes. The Matildas aren't alone, of course, in demonstrating sporting success. The Australian Diamonds recently achieved their 12th Netball World Cup title, cementing their position as one of the world's most exceptional netball teams, and the Australian women's cricket team have recently produced incredible performances, retaining the Ashes in 2023 and claiming victory in the 2022 World Cup and the T20 World Cup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a proud sporting nation, and I acknowledge the member for Werriwa who has put forward this important motion. In less than a decade, Australia will host its third Olympic Games. It's an extraordinary achievement and a vote of confidence in our country. Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000 in different eras transformed the way we saw ourselves as a country and created a generation of sporting heroes. Success always starts with investing in the grassroots, and it filters up. That's why I'm pleased to support Peter Dutton's commitment to allocate $250 million over four years for female sports infrastructure. It means having changing rooms for women as good as the blokes have. Women shouldn't have to feel that they need to get changed in car parks or open fields or only feel safe showering at home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that in my electorate such facilities matter. In 2018 I secured $2.7 million in federal funding for Greenway Park in my electorate. Greenway Park Sportshouse opened in 2021, and, importantly, those facilities provide important spaces for women's participation in sport. The evidence from the previous Olympics is clear: we need to invest in the grassroots now if we are to squeeze everything we can out of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. That includes investing heavily in sporting infrastructure that's more accessible for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we acknowledge the champions of sport today, I want to acknowledge one from my own electorate, the late great Robin Timmins. Robin passed away last month. She was a pioneer in women's sport in this country. Robin loved our community. She was a passionate member of the Beecroft garden club, served as president of the Beecroft Probus club and was a lifelong Liberal. But perhaps most of all Robin loved rugby. Robin became involved in the Eastwood District Rugby Referees Association in 1963, 60 years ago. There was no Eastwood rugby fan who was more devoted or passionate than Robin. In 1968 she joined Sydney Rugby Union as a secretary. She soon expressed an interest in sitting the referees exam, but was told women weren't allowed to participate. So Robin, in typical style, read the organisation's constitution and, after finding no mention of gender, convinced the chairman to let her sit the exam. She passed and became the first female rugby union referee in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Becoming Australia's first female rugby referee wasn't the only feat that Robin achieved. In 2002 she was the first woman to be awarded life membership by the New South Wales Rugby Union Referees Association, for her outstanding contribution to refereeing. In 2013 she received the OAM and became the first woman in NSW rugby union's 139-year history to be awarded honorary life membership. In the same year, she received the International Rugby Board Development Award for her service to the game. Robin blazed a trail for generations of Australian women in rugby to come. Not only did she break through barriers for women in the game; through her committed service to the game she opened many doors for more women to become involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the superstars we see on TV today, Robin helped other women to see what was possible as a woman in her chosen sport. Robin's sport was rugby, and I have little doubt, knowing what a sport tragic she was, that she would have cheered the roof off for the Matildas as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion rightly acknowledges not only how far women's sport has come in this country but also how much more potential and opportunity for achievement there still is into our future.</span>
